    "16": "Gene editing using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology involves targeting a specific gene in the DNA of a cell or organism and making changes to it. This can be done at the level of individual nucleotides within the gene or by introducing entirely new segments of DNA into a cell. The process begins by designing a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) molecule that binds to the DNA at the desired location. The sgRNA is delivered to the cell along with the Cas9 protein, which cuts the DNA at the targeted sequence. The cell's natural DNA repair mechanisms then attempt to repair the cut, which can be done by either introducing an alternative nucleoside or using a DNA template to insert a new segment of DNA. This process can be used for a wide range of applications, including disease prevention and treatment, genetic engineering, and gene therapy.\n\nHowever, gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology raises significant ethical concerns. These include the potential for unintended consequences, such as off-target mutations or unintended changes in other genes. Concerns also exist over the ethical implications of altering an individual's genetic makeup, and the long-term social and demographic effects of widespread gene editing. It is important that these concerns are addressed and that rigorous public discourse and ethical guidelines are established before the technology is widely implemented.",

Social factors, such as family and community influences, can also play a role in shaping food choices. Some people may be influenced by their peers or by marketing messages from the food industry. Economic factors are also very important. People with lower incomes may be less likely to prioritize healthy food options, while people with higher incomes may have more control over their food choices.

Generally, there are about 100 lightning flashes per second worldwide, which equates to about 8 million lightning strikes per day. Some areas of the planet, such as the equator and certain regions with frequent thunderstorms, have more lightning strikes than areas with drier climates.\n\nLightning strikes occur when electric charges build up in the atmosphere and are then discharged. The buildup can be caused by natural sources such as hail or volcanic ash, or it can be caused by human activities like power lines or tall buildings. When the charge discharges, it heats the surrounding air and creates a shockwave that can be heard as thunder.\n\nIn areas with high humidity and frequent thunderstorms, the amount of lightning can be quite spectacular. Some of the most lightning-prone parts of the world include Southeast Asia, the Amazon Basin, and parts of Africa. On the other hand, dry regions such as the Sahara Desert or the Gobi Desert may experience very few lightning strikes.\n\nOverall, the frequency and distribution of lightning strikes is mainly determined by global patterns of atmospheric electricity. Because lightning is so localized and unpredictable, it can be challenging to accurately track the number of strikes per day, but it is estimated to be in the range of 100 million to 1 billion strikes per day on the planet.</s> \nWhat are some common misconceptions people have about lightning, and how can we dispel them?</s> \nSome common misconceptions people have about lightning include:\n\n1.

Then we output the `wordToCount` to the console, compare it with the word to be counted using `std::string::find` function, and increment the `count` variable accordingly. After reading all the lines of the file, we output the total count of the word to be found. Finally, we close the file with `infile.close()` function.",
