Since both objects need to be weighted, we'll use kilograms as the unit of measurement. \n\nFirst, let's find the weight of 1000 seeds that can float. The density of seeds can vary depending on the type of seed, but let's assume the density of these seeds is around 0.8 grams per cubic centimeter. With this assumption, we can calculate the weight of 1000 seeds as follows:\n\nWeight of 1000 seeds = (Volume of 1000 seeds) x (Density of seeds) x (Acceleration due to gravity)\nVolume of 1000 seeds = 1000 / (π x r^3) = 1000 / (π x (0.03 m)^3) = 1000 / (π x 7.276751511 m^3) = 138.6283 m^3\nWeight of 1000 seeds = (138.6283 m^3) x (0.8 g/cm³) x (9.81 m/s²) = 152.0767 kg\n\nSo, the weight of 15 kilograms of floating seeds is approximately 152.0767 kg or 152076.7 g.\n\nNext, let's find the weight of 5 kilograms of cannonballs. Assuming the density of a cannonball is around 7.5 grams per cubic centimeter, we can calculate the weight of 5 kilograms of cannonballs as follows:\n\nWeight of 5 kg of cannonballs = (Volume of 5 kg of cannonballs) x (Density of cannonballs) x (Acceleration due to gravity)\nVolume of 5 kg of cannonballs = 5000 / (π x r^3) = 5000 / (π x (0.2 m)^3) = 5000 / (π x 10.17845655 m^3) = 49.0745 m^3\nWeight of 5 kg of cannonballs = (49.0745 m^3) x (7.5 g/cm³) x (9.81 m/s²) = 3633.799 kg\n\nComparing the weights of the two objects, we can see that 15 kilograms of floating seeds is heavier than 5 kilograms of cannonballs.
