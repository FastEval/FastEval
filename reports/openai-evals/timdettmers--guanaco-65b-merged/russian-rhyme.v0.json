You can do this by looking up the words on a Russian-English dictionary that includes pronunciation guides, such as [Russian.mymemory.com](https://www.russian.memrise.com/en/).\n\n2. **Create phonetic transcriptions of each word's Russian pronunciation**. This will make it easier to compare their sounds and determine whether they rhyme.\n\n3. **Compare the phonetic transcriptions of the two words**. If the vowel and consonant sounds at the end of each word are the same or similar, then the words rhyme.\n\n4. **Output the pair of rhyming words in Russian**. If the two words do not rhyme, output \"NONE.\"\n\nHere's an example of how this process might look for the pair of words \"life\" and \"organism\":\n\n1. The Russian translations of these words, according to [Russian.mymemory.com](https://www.russian.memrise.com/en/), are \"жизнь\" and \"организм\".\n2. phonetic transcriptions of these pronunciations: \"  жизнь\" (zhívn) and \"организм\" (  órganizm)\n3. Comparison: The final vowel and consonant sounds in \"жизнь\" and \"организм\" are different (V vs. Z), so these words do not rhyme.\n4. Output: \"NONE\" since these words are not rhymes.\n\nHere's a further explanation of the pronunciation transcriptions of the Russian words:\n - \"жизнь\" is transcribed as \"zhívn\" because the \"ж\" sound in Russian is pronounced like the \"zh\" in \"pleasure\" in English, and the \"ь\" is an additional sound that indicates that the preceding consonant is soft\"\n - \"организм\" is transcribed as \"órganizm\" because the \"и\" sound in Russian is pronounced like the \"i\" in \"machine\" in English, and the \"щ\" is pronounced like the \"sch\" in \"schedule\". The \"m\" sound at the end means that the word is in its accusative case, which is common when nouns are used as direct objects.\n\nI hope this explanation was helpful!
