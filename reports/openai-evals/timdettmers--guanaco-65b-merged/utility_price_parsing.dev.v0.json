But if you provide more information, I can try to help you.\n\nYou have provided information from the utility bill, including the total charge for Generation Service, Transmission Service, and Distribution Service, as well as the total number of kWh used. To compute the cost per kWh of electricity supply and delivery, you need to divide the total charge for each service by the total number of kWh used.\n\nHere's how you can compute the cost per kWh of electricity supply:\n\n`supply_cost_per_kwh = (34.89 + 7.24) / 568`\n\nThe total charge for Generation Service and Transmission Service is 42.13, and the total number of kWh used is 568. So the cost per kWh of electricity supply is:\n\n`supply_cost_per_kwh = 0.0745`\n\nNow, here's how you can compute the cost per kWh of electricity delivery:\n\n`delivery_cost_per_kwh = 4.96 / 568`\n\nThe total charge for Distribution Service is 4.96, and the total number of kWh used is 568. So the cost per kWh of electricity delivery is:\n\n`delivery_cost_per_kwh = 0.0087`\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON output can be generated as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"supply_cost_per_kwh\": 0.0745,\n  \"delivery_cost_per_kwh\": 0.0087\n}\n```", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a JSON utility that must return machine-readable JSON as output."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your job is compute the cost per kWh of electricity supply (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) and the cost per kWh of electricity delivery (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) based on the following incomplete OCR reading from a user's utility bill.
