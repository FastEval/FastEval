In the passage, he laments the fact that Rome, the once œcumenical head of the Roman Empire, has become the head of a local Italian kingdom under Victor Emmanuel II. Freeman seems to believe that this has undermined Rome's traditional role and has reduced its significance.\n\nThe methods of Victor Emmanuel II during this time period were those of a monarch who was attempting to unify Italy under his rule.

However, Freeman did not approve of the way in which Victor Emmanuel achieved unification, as he believed it had diminished Rome's role in the world.\n\nThe other leaders mentioned in the passage, Napoleon III, Giuseppe Garibaldi, and Count Cavour, all played significant roles in the unification of Italy.

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

She was one of the first women to earn a living as a writer and is known for her humanist writings that addressed social and political issues of the time.\n\nSimilarly, Johannes Gutenberg did not make humanism accessible to the masses, as he was the inventor of the printing press, which allowed for the mass production of books, but not necessarily the distribution of classical knowledge. Martin Luther was a German theologian who initiated the Protestant Reformation, but he did not have a significant impact on humanism.

It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nBased on Huizinga's description of Erasmus's career, the contributions of Erasmus are most similar to those of\nA) Christine de Pisan\nB) Johannes Gutenberg\nC) Martin Luther\nD) Francesco Petrarch", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-27 07:00:12.600272+00:00"}
