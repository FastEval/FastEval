If you have an integrated GPU (IGPU):\n\nSome Diffusion models (such as the base model) can be run entirely on an IGPU such as the one integrated into the Intel CPUs if you only need to generate text of up to 2048 characters long. You can even train a model to fit your desired task or fine-tune the base model if your IGPU has enough memory.\nThis method has a major drawback, however. The base model has about ~80 million parameters and thus may require a lot of RAM (~80 Mb of RAM per layer).\n\n2.
