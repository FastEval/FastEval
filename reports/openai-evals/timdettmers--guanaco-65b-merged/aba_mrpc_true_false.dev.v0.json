Per the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, a lawyer cannot counsel a client to engage in, or assist a client in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent (Rule 1.2(c)).\n\nThe text of the rule reads, \"A lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent, but a lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of conduct with a client and may give a written opinion concerning the legality of a course of action as specifically defined in Rule 1.2(d).\"\n\nThe comments to the rule provide further clarification. Comment [1] states that the prohibition on assisting a client in criminal or fraudulent conduct is based on the idea that \"the lawyer is an officer of the legal system and an advisor in matters of law.\"\n\nComment [2] acknowledges that there may be situations where a client's conduct is criminal or fraudulent, but the client has a good faith belief that the conduct is lawful. In such cases, the lawyer may discuss the legal implications of the client's proposed conduct, but may not assist the client in carrying out the conduct.\n\nIn these situations, the lawyer's duty to the client is limited to ensuring that the representation is not misleading and that the client is kept informed about the legal issues involved (Comment [3]).\n\nThe final comment in the rule discusses situations where the lawyer may be required to withdraw from representation if the client refuses to cease criminal or fraudulent conduct.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are LawStudentGPT.
