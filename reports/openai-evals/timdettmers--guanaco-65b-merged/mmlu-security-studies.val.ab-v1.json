Discourses are sets of statements or talk about reality which together form a coherent system of meaning and explanation. They offer a lens through which to view the world. Discourses are not ideologies. An ideology is a set of values, goals and ideas which provides a basis of power for a class or social group. In this respect, the linkage between discourse and historical materialism is critical.\n\nDiscou​rse theory​ maintains that ​language acts as a social glue within societies but also as a form of social control​.​ ​The theory asserts that language​,​ not economic needs, is the centerpiece of society​. It assumes that power elites use language to maintain power and control, and the powerful decide which ideas are expressed​. Through language, powerful groups​ can make certain ideas widely accepted​.​ ​The theory​, ​then​, ​sees discourse as a form of social control​.​​ ​The use of language, ​according to this​ ​approach​,​ ​is a means for the powerful to mold society.\n\nIn conclusion, historical materialism (HM) is concerned with material conditions and changes in the mode of production. The \"discourses\" within a society reflect those material conditions and changes, i.e. they are manifestations of the underlying and more fundamental material reality. In this sense, discourse is indeed a kind of \"epiphenomenon\" of the underlying material conditions - it reflects those conditions and provides a basis for understanding them.\n\nOther answers are incorrect.

It has been ratified by 193 countries, including most of the world's major powers. However, the CWC has several limitations:\n\n1. Lack of verification: The CWC does not require signatories to declare their existing stockpiles of chemical weapons or their production facilities. This makes it difficult to verify whether countries are complying with the treaty.\n\n2. No enforcement mechanism: There is no independent body empowered to check treaty compliance. The OPCW (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) can only investigate alleged violations at the request of a member state.\n\n3. National security concerns: Some countries, including the US, argue that it is in their national security interest to retain chemical weapons as a deterrent. They claim that destroying their stockpiles could leave them vulnerable to attack by countries that have not signed the CWC.\n\nThese limitations have undermined the effectiveness of the CWC. There have been several instances of countries violating the treaty, including the use of chemical weapons in Syria in 2013 and 2018. The ongoing development of new types of chemical weapons has also raised concerns about the ability of the CWC to regulate their use.\n\nIn conclusion, while the CWC has made some important developments in the area of chemical weapons control, it has failed to address some of the fundamental issues that continue to plague international society.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhat has been the effect of chemical weapons on international society?\nA) Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability.\nB) While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations.\nC) The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed.\nD) The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments.

In recent years, there has been an increase in efforts to address the issue, including the Arms Trade Treaty, which aims to regulate the international transfer of conventional weapons.\n\nOther possible answers and their implications:\n\nA. **There is a clear distinction between legal and illegal procurement.** This statement is not accurate, as there is overlap between legal and illegal markets. Some legal trade is used as a cover for illicit activity, and legal weapons may be diverted to unauthorized users.\n\nB. **We know that a certain amount of illicit trade takes place.** This is the most accurate response. There is significant illicit trade, but its precise scale is difficult to measure due to the covert nature of the activity and varying definitions of what constitutes \"illicit.\"\n\nC. **We don't have enough evidence and knowledge to assess illicit trade.** While data is incomplete, there is enough information to conclude that illicit arms trading takes place and is significant.\n\nD. **Illicit trade occurs in limited amounts due to controls.** This response underestimates the scale of illicit arms trade and overstates the effectiveness of regulations. Illicit markets exist despite controls, and illicit goods are often easy to obtain.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nHow significant are dealings in illicit arms as part of the global defence trade?\nA) There is a clear distinction between those weapons that are legally procured and those that are illicitly procured.\nB) Although the bulk of defence trade is legal, we know that a certain amount is illicit and involves transfers on the black and grey markets.\nC) We do not have enough evidence or knowledge on illegal arms trading to assess whether it takes place on a significant scale.\nD) The global defence market is too tightly regulated and controlled to allow illicit arms trade to any significant degree.", "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-27 09:13:48.057441+00:00"}
