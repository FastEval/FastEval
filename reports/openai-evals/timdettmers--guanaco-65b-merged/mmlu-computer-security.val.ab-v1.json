It provides a secure channel for data transmission, ensuring that the communicating parties are who they claim to be and that the data cannot be intercepted or modified by third parties.\n\nIn the given scenario, the establishment of a TLS connection implies that the client and server have verified each other's identities using digital certificates, and that they are communicating over an encrypted channel using symmetric encryption (e.g., AES). This means that the following attacks are mitigated by TLS:\n\n1. Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: TLS prevents an attacker from intercepting or modifying the data being transmitted between the client and server.\n2. Replay attacks: TLS uses a cryptographic nonce to ensure that each transaction is unique, preventing an attacker from replaying a previous transaction.\n3. SSL stripping: TLS prevents an attacker from downgrading the connection to an insecure protocol, such as HTTP.\n\nRegarding the attacks you mentioned specifically:\n\n1. stealing the server's private key: TLS protects against this attack because the private key is never transmitted over the network. An attacker could only read the plaintext of recorded past connections if they had access to the server's private key and could decrypt the recorded traffic.\n\n2. creating a fake certificate: TLS protects against this attack because the certificates issued by certificate authorities (CAs) are verified as part of the TLS handshake.
