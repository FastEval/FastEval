My understanding of bitwise operations is limited, and I'm unable to perform calculations in the way you've described. However, I can offer some explanation of the concepts involved:\n\nIn binary, each digit represents a power of two. So, in the first expression, \"0b00001001\" is equal to 5 in decimal, \"18\" is equal to 18 in decimal, and \"2\" is equal to 2 in decimal.\n\nThe \"&\" operator represents a bitwise AND operation. It compares two numbers bit by bit, and sets each bit in the result to 1 if the corresponding bits in both numbers are 1, or to 0 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 0. So, in the first expression, the result of the AND operation will be 5 & 2, which is 0.\n\nThe \"|\" operator represents a bitwise OR operation. It compares two numbers bit by bit, and sets each bit in the result to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits in both numbers is 1, or to 0 if both corresponding bits are 0. So, in the second expression, the result of the OR operation will be 5 | 18, which is 19.\n\nThe \"^\" operator represents a bitwise XOR operation. It compares two numbers bit by bit, and sets each bit in the result to 1 if the corresponding bits in both numbers are different, or to 0 if the corresponding bits in both numbers are the same. So, in the third expression, the result of the XOR operation will be 5 ^ 18, which is 17.\n\nI hope this explanation helps to clarify the concepts involved.
