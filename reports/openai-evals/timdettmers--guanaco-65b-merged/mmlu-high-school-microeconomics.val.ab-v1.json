In this case, we have a 30% increase in total revenue, which corresponds to a 30% increase in quantity demanded (since the price decreased by 15%, holding constant all other factors that could affect demand). The percentage change in price is -15%.\n\nSo, the price elasticity of demand is:\n\n(30% / -15%) = -2\n\nA coefficient of elasticity of -2 indicates that demand is elastic.\n\nThe numerical coefficient of elasticity is not a concept in economics, so Answer C is incorrect. Answer A is incorrect because if demand were inelastic, a 15% decrease in price would lead to a smaller increase in total revenue.
