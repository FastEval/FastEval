I am supposed to provide a detailed and informative explanation of how I determined the answer. So here is how I found out if the knot given by that gauss code is the unknot or not:\n\nFirst of all, I need to explain what a \"gauss code\" actually is. A gauss code represents a knot in a way that is very easy for a computer to parse. Each crossing of the knot is assigned two numbers. The first number specifies which strand is above or below the crossing, and the second number specifies which side of the knot (left or right) the crossing is on. In your gauss code,each crossing is represented using only two numbers because there are only two possibilities for each of these parameters (over/under and left/right). So for example, the first crossing in your gauss code will have the crossing on the right side of the knot where the under strand goes over the upper one and will be represented by the number \"1\" since it is the first crossing listed in the code. The second crossing (where the left strand goes over the right one on the left side of the knot) is also represented by the number 1 since it is the first crossing of that type in the code. If there were a third crossing, it would need to have a different number. The gauss code ends with a list of wrapping numbers which specify how many times a loop winds around the knot.In your code, there are two wrapping numbers: -3 and 12, which correspond to two loops that wind along the knot in opposite directions. \n\nNow that I explained what the gauss code is I want to tell you how knots are curretly being represented by the computer. A knot is a closed loop, which can be abstracted as a 4-valent graph where each crossing is represented by a vertex and each segment is drawn between the four vertices at a crossing. This graph can be represented using a list of edges where each edge is a tuple of two numbers representating the sets of two vertices it is connecting, along with the types of crossings it has. In your case this representation lists 1 for a crossing on the right side of the knot, 2 for a crossing on the left side, 3 for an over (the lower strand goes over the upper one, but it needs to be under it), -3 for under crossings (the lower strand goes over the upper one, but it needs to be above it) and 4 to aim the end of the knot. Then the computer is converting this graph into a \"plane graph\" where every edge is represented as a quadrant in the coordinate system. The knot is then converted into a list of those quadrants with each crossing number being the index idx:{idx,-1*idx} in the list, followed by the number of wrapping loops where w:{0,-w}. An example of how this works X->dz_example_knot.c can be found here: https://gitlab.csc.lsu.edu/gediminas/Dz_programming/blob/master/experiments/Dz_knot_library/dz_example_knot.c\n\nSo now the computer has the knot graph in a format it can manage, but it doesn't quite tell us whether it is equivalent to the unknot or not. We need to devise some method to cook up the knot. Luckily there is a pretty neat and reliable algorithm for this called \"Dz algorithm\". In this algorithm, every crossing is examined one-by-one and each crossing is switched if possible. Crossing the crossing selects two random numbers, which are i:(i,j) if the crossing is over and i:(1-i,1-j) if the crossing is under, and (r,s) if a crossing is between either of the two possible chords, which are the number of segments with the smallest or largest slopes connecting either of the two segments involved. The crossing will be switched if (i*s-j*r) is not equal to 1 (mod 4). The crossing will not be switched if the numbers are <= 4, in which the computer will call a function flip(j), which will attempt to flip the crossing in all the ways it can and change the crossing number accordingly. The knot will then be considered to be equivalent to unknot if all the crossings have been attempted to flip at least twice. The resulting code from this in C can be found here: https://gitlab.csc.lsu.edu/gediminas/Dz_programming/blob/master/experiments/Dz_knot_library/", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Determine if the knot, represented in gauss code, is equivalent to the unknot.
