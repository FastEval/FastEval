These mutations can occur in any cell of the body, including cells of the blood, skin, heart, lung, and others. They can be caused by environmental factors such as exposure to radiation or chemicals, or they can occur due to random errors in DNA replication.\n\nSomatic mutations can have a variety of effects. Some somatic mutations may have no noticeable effect, while others may lead to changes in the function of the affected cells or even to the development of cancer. It's important to note that somatic mutations do not affect the DNA of gametes and, therefore, they cannot be passed down to the next generation.\n\nOncogenes, in contrast, are genes that have the potential to cause cancer when mutated.

Square this number to get the carrier frequency: (0.000015625)^2 = 2.44140625 x 10^-9.\n4. Convert back to a proportion: 2.44140625 x 10^-9 = 0.0000244.\n5. Move the decimal point two places to the right to get the frequency as a percentage: 0.00244.\n6. Convert to a fraction and simplify: 0.00244 = 1/416.\n7. Divide by 2 to get the frequency of carriers: 1/(416/2) = 1/208.\n\nSo, the frequency of carriers for an autosomal recessive disorder with an incidence of 1 in 6400 is approximately 1 in 208. However, this is not one of the options given.\n\nTo get the approximate frequency of carriers to 1 in 80, we need to convert the fraction 1/208 to its lowest terms.
