Next, \\frac{19}{3} is not yet prime, so we divide by 2 which gives \\frac{9{1/2}}{3}. This is all equivalent to the mechanism of the first step multiplied by 2. Then dividing by 3 gives a remainder of 1. Done\nThe other choices show a more complicated step process in which they line up with a step process involving 2, but this is made less efficient using larger numbers. Hence the number of simplification steps are maximized.\n\nThe steps are:\n- Term 1: 17/3\n- Term 2: (17-2)*2 = 19/3\n- Term 3: (19-2)*2 = 41/3", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "A sequence of numbers with one blank(__) as a question, and four options as possible answers will be given, try to find the pattern of the sequence of numbers, then choose the most suitable one as your answer to fill the blank, user will use latex if necessary.
