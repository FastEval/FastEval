Based on this, I can infer that you are looking for the middle allele, which is the allele that is present in both the parent genotypes but in neither of the homozygous offspring genotypes.\n\nTrace each cross individually, and determine the parent genotypes and offspring genotypes.

We can write this equation as:\n\np^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1\n\nwhere q is the frequency of the recessive allele (the lowercase letter).\n\nNow, let's look at the given data:\n\n- There are three genotypes: UZ, uz, and uZ\n- The number of offspring for each genotype is 5, 52, 49, 9, 61, 48, and 10\n\nWe can start by calculating the frequency of the recessive allele (q) for the first genotype, UZ. We have:\n\np^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1\n\n5 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2\n\n5 - q^2 = p^2 + 2pq\n\n-q^2 + 2pq = 5 - p^2\n\nq^2 - 2pq + p^2 = 5 - p^2\n\n(q - p)(q + p) = 5\n\nSince we know that p is the dominant allele (uppercase), we can assume that it has a higher frequency than q, so we can write:\n\nq - p = 5/2\n\nq + p = 7/2\n\nq = 5/2 - p\n\nq + 5/2 - p = 7/2\n\n2q + 5/2 = 7/2\n\n2q = 7/2 - 5/2\n\n2q = 2\n\nq = 1\n\np = 5/2 - 1 = 1/2\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency of the recessive allele (q) for the second genotype, uz.
