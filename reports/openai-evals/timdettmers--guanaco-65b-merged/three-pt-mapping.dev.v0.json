Our goal is to find the middle allele (i.e., the allele that is present in the highest number of genotypes).\n\nWe can approach this problem by first sorting the genotypes in ascending order based on their number of offspring.

Therefore, the middle allele is the allele that is present in the genotype with the intermediate number of offspring, which is b.\n\nNote that if the difference between the first and last genotypes is exactly 1, then there is no middle allele.

In this problem, you are given a set of genotypes and the corresponding number of offspring. Your goal is to find the allele that is heterozygous (the middle allele) and output only that allele in lowercase.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can use the principles of genetics. When two heterozygous individuals mate, they can produce offspring with the following genotypes:\n\n1. Homozygous dominant (BB or AA): These individuals will have two dominant alleles, and they will produce only dominant phenotypes.\n2. Homozygous recessive (bb or aa): These individuals will have two recessive alleles, and they will produce only recessive phenotypes.\n3. Heterozygous (Bb or Aa): These individuals will have one dominant and one recessive allele, and they will produce both dominant and recessive phenotypes in a 3:1 ratio. This ratio is known as the Law of Segregation.\n\nBased on the Law of Segregation, we can assume that the middle allele is the heterozygous allele. We can count the number of offspring for each genotype and look for which genotype has a 3:1 ratio of dominant to recessive offspring.
