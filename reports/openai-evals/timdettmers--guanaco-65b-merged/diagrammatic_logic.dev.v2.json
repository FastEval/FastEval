In order to solve this problem correctly, you must consider the logical operators. If there are multiple operators applied you must they apply them left to right. In some cases the operator effect is not explicitly defined and you will need to work it out. You MUST NOT PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION with words you only MUST ONLY REPLY WITH A SINGLE LETTER, for example 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'.\n    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Definition of each operator and what it does:\nOperator, Effect\nP Changes 1st figure (see examples)\nQ Changes shading and shape of all figures\nR Changes 3rd figure (see examples)\nS Deletes small light figures\n\nExamples of these operators on some made up sequences:\nInput, Process, Output\n| small light circle | | small light circle | | large dark circle | - P - | large light circle | | small light circle | | large dark circle |\n| small light circle | | small light triangle | - Q - | small dark triangle | | small dark circle |\n| small dark circle | | large light triangle | | large dark circle | - R - | small dark circle | | large light triangle | | large light circle |\n| small light circle | | large dark triangle | - S - | large dark triangle |\n\nQuestion:\n| small dark triangle | | small dark circle | | small dark triangle | - R - ?\n\nPossible Answers:\nA - | large dark circle | | large dark triangle | | small light triangle |\nB - | small dark triangle | | small dark circle | | small light triangle | | small light triangle |\nC - | small light triangle | | small dark circle | | small dark triangle |\nD - | small dark triangle | | small dark circle | | small light triangle |\n\n"}], "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-27 03:08:12.345959+00:00"}
