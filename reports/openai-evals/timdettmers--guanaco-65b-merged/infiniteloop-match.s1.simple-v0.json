To determine if a block of code will run forever in an infinite loop or if it will stop, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the loop:** Look for any loops in the code, such as a `for`, `while` or `do-while` loop. In your case, the loop is the code inside the `while` loop.\n\n2. **Analyze the loop condition:** The condition that is being checked in the loop is what determines if the loop will continue or stop.

However, since the size of the `data` array is unknown, it is not possible to determine if the loop condition will ever become false. So, in this case, the loop could potentially run forever or it could stop after a certain number of iterations, depending on the length of the `data` array.\n\n4. **Check for any mutations to the loop condition:** In your code, the `index` variable is being incremented inside the loop, which could potentially lead to the loop condition becoming false after a certain number of iterations.

There are no infinite loops in the given code. The `goto` statements are used to transfer control to a label, which is similar to a loop, but the number of iterations is fixed.\n\nFor example, in the `checkEven` function, the `if` statement checks whether the `num` variable is divisible by 2. If it is, the code transfers to the `even_no` label and prints the message \"The number is even.\". The `goto` statement then transfers back to the beginning of the `even_no` label. This effectively forms a loop that will repeat until the condition is no longer met, at which point the code will transfer to the `odd_no` label.\n\nSimilarly, in the `main` function, the `checkEven` function is called with the `i` variable, which has a value of 10. The function will print either \"The number is even.\" or \"The number is odd.\" depending on whether `i` is divisible by 2.\n\nTherefore, the code will eventually stop running, as there are no infinite loops.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.
