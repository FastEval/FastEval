While they're getting to know each other, it would be a good subject for the replacement to ask about Wai-Hin, determining if the replacement knows her well and maintains ongoing contact. If so, Connie may still be able to see Wai-Hin frequently. And even if they don't see each other much, Wai-Hin's replacement might be invited to the catch-up meal some day.\n\nBut if either that fails, or Connie doesn't invest a lot of time with the replacement, then orbits may never really *overlap* well. If she's already tried contacting Wai-Hin itself, then most combination with that will have same result, whether or not investing her time with the replacement comes afterwards, in parallel, or only beforehand. But even if she hasn't contacted Wai-Hin yet, and by some chance the replacement is the reason this friendship ended, then at least the replacement got to know the new person being played into, and can more easily be a \"buffer\" and snitch if Wai-Hin and Connie want to see each other again.\n\nBut even if Connie **really** wants to get back Wai-Hin in her life (so she should have done d), isolation from her friends is very bleak fate and would color Connie's entire perception of the new person.
