It may be helpful to break this calculation down into simpler parts. First, we can divide the values into those that are whole notes and half notes, and those that are shorter durations. Next, we can add up the duration of the whole and half notes, as 1 whole note is equal to 2 half notes, and replaces them, and then add the remaining duration in simple fractions.\n\nThe whole and half note durations will last for 5 measures, as (1 whole note + 5 half notes) = (2 + 2 * 2 + 1) = 5 measures. The remaining durations will split into 4 + 2 + 8 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 52 quarter notes, which will fill out 13 aligning quarter notes in the measures.\n\nWe can break this down into an equivalent series of whole and half notes, (2 whole notes + 1 half note), appending this to the end of the previous wholes and halfs measure. Then continuing with the remaining fractions as before.\n\n(2 + 1) + 4 + 2 + 8 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 3 + (2 + 1) + 4 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 2 = (4 + 9) + 52 = 65 quarter notes\n\nNext we note that each measure can hold 2 quarter notes, so that this will spend a total of 32 + 12 = 44 measures. Finally, we consider that the anacrusis lasts for 1 quarter note, leaving a total of 45 quarter notes for the simple fraction durations.\n\nThus the total number of measures will be the largest multiple of 2 less than the remaining fraction (in quarter notes), 45 * 2.
