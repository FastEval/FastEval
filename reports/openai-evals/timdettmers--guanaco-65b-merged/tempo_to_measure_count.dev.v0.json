Naomi Smith, a digital workplace futurist, imagined a future where there could be a personal AI assistant for each employee. These AI assistants could learn their preferences, schedules, and working style over time, and proactively make decisions based on the user's situation. For example, an AI assistant could schedule meetings, set reminders, and pull up relevant information when needed. Ms. Smith acknowledged the privacy and security concerns inherent in such a system but pointed out that many people already have similar issues with consumer AI assistants.\n\nThe use of AI-powered assistants in the workplace could bring significant benefits, especially for knowledge workers. These assistants can free up human workers from mundane tasks, allowing them to focus on creative and strategic work. This shift in the nature of work could drive productivity and innovation in the workplace. However, such changes could also result in job displacement or the creation of new job categories that did not exist before.\n\nSource: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/03/16/ai-personal-assistants/\n\nIn conclusion, personal AI assistants could have a significant impact on the workplace, doing everything from scheduling meetings to making proactive decisions on your behalf. Understanding the potential benefits and challenges of AI assistants can help organizations and individuals make informed decisions about incorporating them into the workplace."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-17 12:46:11.721036+00:00"}
