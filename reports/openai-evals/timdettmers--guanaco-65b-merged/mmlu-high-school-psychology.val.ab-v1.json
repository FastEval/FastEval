People may jump from one topic to another, or say things that do not make sense. \nNegative symptoms: Lack of interest or motivation, emotional flatness, or withdrawal from social activities.\n\nWhat causes schizophrenia is not fully understood, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is no single gene that causes schizophrenia, but several genes have been identified that increase the risk of developing the condition. Environmental factors such as stress, drug use, and difficulty in the early years of life may also contribute to the development of schizophrenia.\n\nTreatment for schizophrenia includes a combination of medication and psychosocial therapy.
