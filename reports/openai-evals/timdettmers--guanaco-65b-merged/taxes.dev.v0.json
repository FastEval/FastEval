Because I am not a tax expert, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your question.\n\nHowever, I can offer some general guidance on how to estimate your taxes. In this case, you need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. Federal income tax: Your federal income tax will be calculated based on your taxable income, which is your gross income minus any deductions and exemptions. The tax rates for 2021 are progressive, meaning they increase as your income increases. You can use the IRS tax calculator to estimate your federal income tax. The income tax rate for $50,000 of income is around 22%, which would result in a tax liability of around $11,000.\n\n2. State income tax: You will need to pay state income tax in both California (where you work) and New York (where you live). In California, the state income tax rate is progressive, with a top rate of 13.3%. In New York, the state income tax rate is also progressive, with a top rate of 8.82%. To estimate your state income tax liability, you will need to determine which state's tax laws apply to your situation.\n\n3. Local income tax: Some cities and regions may impose their own income taxes. For example, New York City has a local income tax of about 3.9%. You may need to check with your local government to see if you owe any local income taxes.\n\nIn summary, the exact amount you owe in income taxes will depend on many factors, including your specific circumstances and the applicable tax laws.
