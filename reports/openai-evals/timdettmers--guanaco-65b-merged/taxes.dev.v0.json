In the US, there are eight tax brackets with different marginal tax rates, ranging from 10% for the lowest bracket to 37% for the highest bracket. An individual's tax liability is determined by calculating their marginal tax rate for each bracket and adding them up, with the final total being their effective tax rate.\n\nIn your case, as a single filer under 65 years old in 2021, the federal tax brackets and marginal tax rates are as follows:\nTaxable Income                    Marginal Tax Rate\n\n0 to $9,875                        10%\n\n$9,875 to $40,125                  12%\n\n$40,125 to $85,525                 22%\n\n$85,525 to $163,375                24%\n\n$163,375 to $207,350               32%\n\n$207,350 to $616,375               35%\n\n$616,375 and above                 37%\n\nYour income of $50,000 puts you in the 22% tax bracket. Thus, your marginal tax rate is 22%, and you will pay that rate on every dollar of taxable income above $40,125 (the bottom of the 22% bracket). Your total tax liability is then calculated by multiplying your marginal tax rate by your taxable income:\n\n$50,000 - $40,125 = $9,875 x 0.22 = $2,150\n\nSo, your income tax for summer is $2,150, which puts the answer closest to it as B.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Instructions: You will be presented with a tax calculation and four options A through D.

We can then apply the 2021 tax rates since they are not expected to change for 2022.\n\nThe federal income tax is a progressive tax, meaning that your tax rate increases as your income increases. To calculate your tax liability, you first need to determine your taxable income, which is your total income minus any deductions and exemptions. In this case, your only deduction will be the standard deduction of $13,050, since you are not itemizing deductions. This means that your taxable income will be $86,950 (100,000 - 13,050).\n\nOnce you have your taxable income, you can use the tax rates to calculate your tax liability. In 2021, the tax rates for a single filer range from 10% to 37%. Based on your taxable income of $86,950, you will fall into the 24% tax bracket. This means that your marginal tax rate (the rate applied to your last dollar of income) is 24%.\n\nTo calculate your tax liability, you need to use the tax brackets and rates to calculate the amount of tax owed in each bracket. The tax bracket boundaries are $0 to $9,875 (with a tax rate of 10%), $9,876 to $40,125 (with a tax rate of 12%), and $40,126 to $85,525 (with a tax rate of 22%). Your taxable income of $86,950 falls into the third bracket.\n\nUsing this information, we can calculate your tax liability as follows:\n\nTax owed on first bracket:    $9,875 * 0.1 = 988 Tax owed on second bracket: ($40,125 - $9,875) * 0.12 = 4,315 Tax owed on third bracket: ($86,950 - $40,125) * 0.22 = 14,150\n\nYour total tax liability is the sum of these three amounts:\n\nTotal tax liability = 988 + 4,315 + 14,150 = 19,453\n\nTherefore, your approximate tax liability for the upcoming summer will be $19,453.\n\nSince your question asks you to select an option that is closest to your calculation, I would choose option C as the correct answer. The other three options are not close to the correct answer, as they are much lower (A and B) or much higher (D) than the actual tax liability.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just an approximation and the actual tax liability may differ slightly depending on other factors such as state taxes and any pre-tax deductions from your paycheck.
