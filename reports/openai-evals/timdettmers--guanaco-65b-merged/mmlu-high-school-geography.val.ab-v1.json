It is typically done to concentration the opponent's supporters in fewer districts, so that the other party can win more districts with smaller majorities. It is considered an unfair practice that can distort the results of elections. Gerrymandering has been a topic of debate in the United States for many years and has led to several court cases challenging the practice.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. \"Containment\" is not related to voting districts. It was a strategy during the Cold War to contain the spread of communism.\nB. \"Domino theory\" is also not related to voting districts. It was a theory that if one country in a region fell to communism, nearby countries would also fall like dominos.\nD. \"Separatism\" is the desire by a group to separate from a larger entity, such as a country or state.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?

Zoning creates different zones for different types of land use, and specifies the types of activities that can take place in each zone. This helps to minimize conflicts between different land uses and to improve overall quality of life in a city.\n\nZoning can be used to create buffers between incompatible land uses, such as housing and sewage plants. For example, a zone for housing can be created that is located a certain distance away from a sewage plant, and this zone can be separated from the sewage plant by another zone that is dedicated to industrial uses. This way, the residents of the housing zone will be protected from potential health hazards and nuisances that could be associated with the sewage plant.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and D would not be effective ways to separate discordant land uses. Fences could provide some physical separation, but they would not address the potential health and nuisance issues associated with having housing close to a sewage plant. Malls could create barriers between different land uses, but they would not necessarily address the potential health and nuisance issues, and they could create their own problems, such as traffic congestion and parking issues. Tunnels could provide physical separation, but they would not address the potential health and nuisance issues associated with having housing close to a sewage plant.\n\nIn summary, zoning is an effective way to separate discordant land uses, and it is a commonly used land use planning tool in urban areas.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nHow do city planners separate discordant land uses such as housing and sewage plants?\nA) Fences\nB) Malls\nC) Zoning\nD) Tunnels", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-27 07:03:56.499501+00:00"}
