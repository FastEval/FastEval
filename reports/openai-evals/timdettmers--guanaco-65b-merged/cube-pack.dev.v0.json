Then we can see how many full cubes will fit into the box, and if there is any space left over after that, we can count how many more parts of a cube can fit into the remaining space.\n\nSo, let's start by finding the volume of one of the cubes:\n\nvolume = length * width * height\n\nV = 0.6 * 0.7 * 0.4\n\nV = 0.168 cubic meters\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the box:\n\nV = 1.6 * 0.5 * 0.6\n\nV = 0.48 cubic meters\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many full cubes will fit into the box.
