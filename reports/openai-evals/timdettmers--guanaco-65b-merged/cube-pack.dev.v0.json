The edge lenghts are: c_1 = 0.2 m, c_2 = 0.3 m, c_3 = 0.8 m and b_1 = 0.3 m, b2 = 1.3 m, b3 = 0.4 m. The volume V is calculated by V = c1 * c2 * c3 or V = b1 * b2 * b3.

Therefore case 2/3 is true.\nThis case 2/3 means that our resulting formula is V_result = V_box - V_{cube1} - V_{cube2}.\n\nSimplification\nWe were not given the amount cubes and said in this question there was only one, so there will no cubes fit \nin the box because we cannot stack more cubes in it.\nTherefore we have V_{cube1} = 0, since there is no second cube.\nWe now need to get the maximum layers we can stack without creating a fourth/further lower hollow cuboids:\n\nStep 1: We now need to split the box onto the two dimensions we are going measure in (in this case width and depth), which ends in a length of 1.3 m and a depth of 0.4 m:\nb_length = 1.3 m\nb_depth = 0.4 m\n\nStep 2: Now get the dimensions of the cube:\n   - Calculate the bigger dimension of the two, which is depth\n   - Get the geometry mean, which is 0.5 * (b_depth + c_3)\n   - Round the geometry mean down\nc_new_depth = 0.5 * (0.4 m + 0.8 m) = 0.6 m\nV_{cube2} = c_new_depth * c_new_depth * c_2 = 0.6 m * c_2 = 0.6 m²\n\nStep 3: Case 1 is true, since V_{cube2} = 0.6 m < b_length.\nEach layer can only fit one cube, since we can put then next to each other in length, since they are tight fit, so it does not matter how many layers Therefor case 1 is true:\nV_{cube1} = 0, since no cube will fit\nV_{cube2} = (b_length - c_2), but this is wrong, since it only reduce the last dimension, when we need to reduce the first one.
