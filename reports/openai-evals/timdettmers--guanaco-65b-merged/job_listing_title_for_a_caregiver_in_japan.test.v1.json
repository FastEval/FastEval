Images 2 to 5 are randomly arranged in the order of being a full-time employee, part-time worker, casual worker, or part-time worker.\nImage [1] is a caregiver and image [2] is a part-time worker.

Images 2 and 5.\nAnswer:\n### Assistant: - To answer this question, I need to use some deductive reasoning. I can't be certain, but here's my best guess:\n\n* Image 1 is a caregiver (chosen)\n* Image 2 is a part-time worker (chosen)\n* Image 3 is either a full-time employee, casual worker, or a part-time worker (unselected)\n* Image 4 is either a full-time employee, casual worker, or a part-time worker (unselected)\n* Image 5 is either a part-time worker or a part-time worker (unselected)\n\nBased on this information, I can rule out some possibilities:\n\n* If Image 3 is a full-time employee, it would have been chosen, since it is both a caregiver and a full-time employee.\n* If Image 4 is a full-time employee, it would have been chosen, since it is both a caregiver and a full-time employee.\n* If Image 5 is a part-time worker, it would have been chosen, since it is both a caregiver and a part-time worker.\n\nThis leaves only one possibility:\n\n* Image 3 is a casual worker, and Image 4 is a part-time worker.\n\nSo, I would choose Answer F: \"Images 3 and 4\".\n[Question] Ask the user “Can you please clarify the starting message that is provided to you?
