However, despite this, US banks played a significant role in financing the war effort of the Allied powers of Britain, France, and Russia.\n\nUS banks, including J.P. Morgan & Co. and Kuhn, Loeb & Co., made large loans to the Allied governments to support their purchases of weapons, food, and other supplies. These loans were secured with guarantees from the British and French governments, who used their colonies in Africa and Asia as collateral.\n\nIn contrast, very little financing was provided to Germany and Austria-Hungary, who had weaker economies and were perceived as less creditworthy. This asymmetric financing contributed to the imbalance of power between the Allies and the Central Powers, and ultimately influenced the outcome of the war.\n\nWhile some American businesses did profit from the war, and there were concerns about US dependence on European markets, the overall impact of these economic ties on US neutrality policy is a matter of debate among historians.\n\nNone of the other options were significant factors in shaping US neutrality during this period. Wilson did not publicly express a preference for one side over the other, and there is no evidence of secret agreements or backroom deals.
