It is caused by an increased sensitivity to androgens (male hormones) and can be related to conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), adrenal gland disorders, and tumors. \n\nVirilization is a condition in which the body produces too much of the male sex hormones, androgen and testosterone. It can cause changes in a person's appearance, such as hair growth and a deep voice, and can also affect sexual development. \n\nAcromegaly, also called gigantism, is a hormonal disorder that is caused by an excess of growth hormone. It can lead to overgrowth of bones and tissues, and can cause changes in facial features, thickening of the skin, and enlargement of the hands and feet. It can also affect other organs, such as the heart and kidneys. \n\nThe modified scale of Ferriman and Gallwey is a scoring system that is widely used to assess hirsutism. It assigns points to different areas of the body and the face, and the total score is used to evaluate the extent of hair growth.
