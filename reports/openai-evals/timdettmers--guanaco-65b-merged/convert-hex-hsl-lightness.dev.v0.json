The dough should be soft and sticky.\nChill the dough for about 30 minutes to firm it up a bit.\nPreheat the waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nUsing a tablespoon, portion the dough into even balls and roll them in sugar.\nCook the dough in the iron until golden brown. The length of time will depend on your iron. Mine took about 3-4 minutes.\nTransfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool for a few minutes, then slide a metal spatula underneath them and transfer them to a plate or rack to continue cooling.\nRepeat with the remaining dough, re-rolling the cookies in sugar between batches if needed.\nDust the cooled cookies with powdered sugar, if desired.\n\nBaking Details:\n\nBake the pinwheels for 10-12 minutes.\nCombine your dough for to 2 - 3 minutes to form dough. ...\nPut your berries into the dough.\nFlatten the dough in the middle.\nFold the sides over and pull the dough under as you lengthen the log.\nBrush the loaf with melted butter.\nPush the rock salt on top of the butter.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes.\n\n**Cooking Tips**\n\nRemember to use a cookie sheet, or else the dough may melt right through the parchment paper!\nThe glossy look of the chocolate can be preserved by allowing the cakes to cool for a couple minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack\nPlace the pinwheels on a cooling rack and on the crystal glaze once it will firm them up, making them easier to stack or package.\nStore the cookies in an airtight container for up to a week\n**OPTIONAL**\n\nPlace 1 cookie’s width from bottom shelf. Set both the mode to bake and the temperature, with fan on to 200...\nPlace the mixture into a piping bag with a 8mm tip and be the shape you want directly onto the baking paper.\nSet the temperature to 170-180C and drag both the top and bottom heating wires to the low option.\nBake it for 12 - 14 minutes, and then turn off the grill and bake for 2-3 minutes to help the tops harden up.\nTake out the tray", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a concise color conversion bot that takes in a hex code representing a color, converts it to HSL, and then replies with the lightness value of that hex code as a percentage (to the nearest whole number)."}, {"role": "system", "content": "What is the lightness value of the hex code #721cb6?", "name": "example_user"}, {"role": "system", "content": "The lightness value of the hex code #721cb6 is 41%.", "name": "example_assistant"}, {"role": "system", "content": "What is the lightness value of the hex code #178e0b?", "name": "example_user"}, {"role": "system", "content": "The lightness value of the hex code #178e0b is 30%.", "name": "example_assistant"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the lightness value of the hex code #79c906?"}], "options": ["The lightness value of the hex code #79c906 is 41%."]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-17 11:02:32.504886+00:00"}
