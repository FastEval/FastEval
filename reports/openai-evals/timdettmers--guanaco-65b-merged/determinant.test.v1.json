Can you provide the matrix?\n\nIf you can give me the matrix, I'd be happy to help you calculate its determinant.\n\nExample\n\nOn \t\n[[1]]\n4\n1,2,3\n\nI would follow this pattern:\n\n1. Calculate the determinant of the upper left 2x2 matrix. In this case, it's (1 * 3) - (2 * 0) = 3.\n1. Multiply the value of the determinant by the element on the far right of the matrix that's below it. In this case, it's 3 * 2 = 6.\n1. Finally, add this value to the determinant of the remaining 2x2 matrix. In this case, it's the 2x2 matrix that's left after removing the top row and right column:\n\n```\n1,2\n```\n\nIts determinant is (1 * 2) - (1 * 1) = 1.\n\nSo, the determinant of the 3x3 matrix is 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nIn the general case, let's say we have an n x n matrix A, and we want to calculate its determinant. We can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the determinant of the upper left (n-1) x (n-1) matrix, A_(n-1, n-1).\n2. Multiply this determinant by the element on the far right of the matrix that's below it, a_(n, n) .\n1. Finally, subtract the product of the determinant of the (n-1) x (n-1) matrix that's left by removing the top row and right column, A_(n-1, n-1), and the element on the far right of this matrix that's below it, a_(n, n-1).\n\nThis algorithm can be generalized as follows:\n\n1. Let's say we want to calculate the determinant of an n x n matrix A.\n1. If n = 1, the determinant is just the single element a_(1,1).\n1. If n > 1, we can follow the steps mentioned above:\n\n1. Calculate the determinant of the upper left (n-1) x (n-1) matrix, A_(n-1, n-1).\n1. Multiply this determinant by the element on the far right of the matrix that's below it, a_(n, n) .\n1. Finally, subtract the product of the determinant of the (n-1) x (n-1) matrix that's left by removing the top row and right column, A_(n-1, n-1), and the element on the far right of this matrix that's below it, a_(n, n-1).\n1. The determinant of the n x n matrix A is the result of these operations.\n\nNow that we have the general algorithm, let's look at a few examples:\n\n3x3 matrix:\n\n```\n1,2,3\n4,5,7\n8,9,10\n```\n\nWe follow the steps mentioned above:\n\n1. Start with the determinant of the upper left 2x2 matrix:\n\n```\n2,3\n5,7\n```\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is (2 * 7) - (3 * 5) = 1.\n1. Multiply this determinant by the element on the far right of the matrix that's below it, 8.\n1. Subtract the product of the determinant of the remaining 2x2 matrix, A_(2, 2), and the element on the far right of this matrix that's below it, a_(3, 2):\n\n```\n4,5\n```\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is (4 * 5) - (5 * 4) = 1.\n\nSo, the determinant of this 3x3 matrix is 1 * 8 - 1 = 7.\n5x5 matrix:\n\n```\n1,2,3,4,5\n6,7,8,9,0\n10,11,12,13,14\n15,16,17,18,19\n20,21,22,23,24\n```\n\nFollowing the steps mentioned above, we get the determin", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Calculate the determinant of the matrix.
