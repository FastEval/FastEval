Recognize the features you want to implement, AND the ones you don't, and design your program accordingly.\n\n- **Start simple**: When writing your first program, you should plan to keep it as simple as possible, and make it work correctly **before** adding complex features. Decide what your minimum viable product should be, and get there as quickly as you can. This will prevent you from getting overwhelmed and give you a basic foundation to work from.\n\n- **Code for clarity**: Make your code as easy to read and understand as you possibly can. You should be able to go over it and quickly grasp what it does. If there's something that you think you might forget later, add comments to remind yourself. Your goal is to make your code as self-documenting as you can.\n\n- **Plan your work, and work your plan**: You should know what every part of your program is doing at all times. When you are done writing a section of your program, you should be able to quickly and easily explain what it does. You should plan out your code before you write it, and make sure to break it into logical, easy-to-understand parts.\n\n- **Test early, and test often**: Test your code as soon as possible. Does it do what you expected it to do? If not, go back and figure out where the problem is. Make sure it does what you wanted it to do before moving on to the next part.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is to stay calm, and don't try to rush it. Programming is a process that takes time and patience to learn. When you feel frustrated or overwhelmed, take a break or take the time to think things through and start fresh.
