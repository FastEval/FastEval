The inheritance of wings is an AA'BBB' system. Formally, the distribution of wings is 3B+b. In a population where each individual's wings can have a distribution of 50% to 100%, it is possible to get BB or Bb, however, a B_ genotype is incorrect. The distribution 2/4, 1/4, is not achievable.\n\nF1 Generation: The distribution B_ (amount of B's) + b (amount of b's). After the first hybridization, a BB genotype is no longer possible as the dominant B allele selects for itself. Additionally, the parents cannot contribute more or less than 50% of their genes. If possible, the formula is Punnett Square. B x B = 4B (this formula comes about more often than not). B x B_ = 2B_ + 2b. B x b = 2B_ (take a look at that)\n\nF2 Generation: F1 X F1 yields a mix of gametes above if the genotypes are as stated. Punnett square is BB x BB = 16BC (100% dominant). Bb x Bb = 3BC, 1Bb, 6Cc (88.9% dominant) Bb x bb = BB, 2Bb, CC (80%)\n\nFurther implications:\nThis AA'BBB' system used in this question is also used for white eyes with the genes WW (white) + wc (pink). However, brown and ebony are each dominant over pink, and neither are dominant over each other, so their expected phenotypes are 100% and 0% (9:3:3:1 D:c:+:S) Because of small population sizes over time, this will always quickly result in a population that is uniform for wing color.\nThis is because of the constant part of the D:c+ math used in calculating effects of selection in finite populations.

When these two heterozygous individuals are crossed, the offspring will inherit one allele from each parent. The B allele is dominant to both the G and T alleles, so all offspring with at least one B allele will have the blue phenotype. The probability of inheriting a particular allele from each parent is 1/2, so each offspring has a 1/2 chance of inheriting the B allele from one parent and a 1/2 chance of inheriting the G allele from the other parent.\n\nThis means that there are four possible genotypes for the offspring: BB, BG, GG, and GT. The first three genotypes will result in a blue phenotype, while the GT genotype will result in a turquoise phenotype. The probabilities of inheriting each genotype are as follows:\n\n- BB: one allele from each parent (1/2 x 1/2), so the probability of a BB genotype is 1/4.\n- BG: one allele from each parent or the other way around (1/2 x 2), so the probability of a BG genotype is 2/4 = 1/2.\n- GG: two alleles from one parent (1/2), so the probability of a GG genotype is 1/2.\n- GT: two alleles from one parent (1/2), so the probability of a GT genotype is 1/2.\n\nDue to genetic recombination, the offspring will all have different genotypes, and the distribution of phenotypes will be 3/4 blue and 1/4 turquoise, which corresponds to the given parent and offspring phenotypes.\n\nFinally, note that it is impossible to achieve a parent phenotype of all blue with a population that includes a large number of green and turquoise individuals. If the parents were both homozygous for the B allele (i.e., BB), then all offspring would also be homozygous for the B allele (BB or B_ depending on genetic notation). However, this would quickly lead to a lack of genetic diversity in the population, which would make it more vulnerable to diseases and other environmental factors.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "One type of beetle has 3 possible wing colors, blue, green and turquoise.

In this problem, you are given a population of beetles in which the wing color is determined by a single gene with three alleles (B, G, and T).

The offspring genotypes will be either BB (homozygous dominant), BG (heterozygous), or GG (homozygous recessive).\n\nThe expected phenotype ratios of this cross are 3:1, meaning that for every three individuals with the dominant phenotype (blue wings), there will be one individual with the recessive phenotype (green wings).\n\n3.
