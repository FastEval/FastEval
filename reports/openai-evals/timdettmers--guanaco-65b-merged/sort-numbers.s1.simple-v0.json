However, if you'd like, I can recommend a few tools to accomplish this task. \n\n1. You can simply copy the list of numbers, create a new Google Sheet, paste the numbers into a new row, and then sort them from the \"Data\" menu. This is the quickest and easiest method. \n\n2. If you are using a mac, you can also split the string into an array and sort it in Apple's built-in `Script Editor`. To split the string into an array, use the `split(text, regex)` method. You can then sort the array using the `sort()` method and rejoin it back into a string using the `join()` method. Here's a sample script: \n\n``` \nfunction myFunction() {\n  var text = \"17,15,44,22,8\"; // input string\n  var array = text.split(\",\"); // split string into array\n  array.sort(function(a, b) { // sort array\n    return a - b; });\n  var result = array.join(\",\"); // rejoin array back into string\n  return result; // return result\n}\n``` \n\n3. If none of those options work for you, you can also sort the list manually, which is obviously not recommended. \n\nI hope one of those solutions works for you.
