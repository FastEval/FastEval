Here's some sample code in Python to get you started:\n\n```python\nimport langdetect\n\n# Function to determine if two Hebrew words rhyme\ndef hebrew_rhymes(word1, word2):\n    # Check if words are in Hebrew\n    for w in [word1, word2]:\n        if langdetect.detect(w) != \"he\":\n            return \"NONE\"\n\n    # Use rhyming dictionary or rhyme finder to determine if words rhyme\n    # ...\n\n# Pairs of words to analyze\npairs = [(\"power\", \"flight\"), (\"cat\", \"hat\")]\n\n# Process each pair of words\nfor p in pairs:\n    rhyme = hebrew_rhymes(p[0], p[1])\n    if rhyme == \"NONE\":\n        print(f\"{p[0]} and {p[1]} do not rhyme in Hebrew\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{p[0]} and {p[1]} are rhyming words in Hebrew: {rhyme}\")\n```\n\nHope this helps!"}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-17 11:11:17.019948+00:00"}
