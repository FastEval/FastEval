The EMF is also proportional to the number of turns in the coil. This law is used to calculate the polarization of a substance in a magnetic field.\n\nThermodynamic polarization of protons:\n\nThe thermodynamic polarization of protons is a process in which protons are aligned in a magnetic field. When a proton is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a Lorentz force, which causes it to rotate and align with the field. The degree of alignment depends on the strength of the magnetic field and the temperature of the proton.\n\nI hope this answer is helpful and gives you a better understanding of the calculation of polarization of a proton in a magnetic field", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nCalculate the polarization of a proton in a magnetic field of 335 mT and 10.5 T at 298 K.\nA) 4.126 x 10^-3 at 0.335 T; 2.142 x 10^-6 at 10.5 T\nB) 6.345 x 10^-4 at 0.335 T; 9.871 x 10^-5 at 10.5 T\nC) 1.148 x 10^-6 at 0.335 T; 3.598 x 10^-5 at 10.5 T\nD) 0.793 x 10^-4 at 0.335 T; 6.931 x 10^-7 at 10.5 T", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-27 05:57:41.908076+00:00"}
