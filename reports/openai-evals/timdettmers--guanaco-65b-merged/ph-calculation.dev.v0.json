The dissociation degree, also known as the ionization fraction, is given as 0.25.\nTo calculate the pH of the solution, we can use the following equation:\n\npH = -log [H+]\n\nwhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution.\n\nWe can use the given information to calculate the concentration of H+ ions as follows:\n\n[H+] = (R * c * a) / ([H+] + a)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J/K*mol), c is the concentration of the acid (0.0004 M), a is the dissociation degree (0.25), and [H+] is the concentration of hydronium ions (the concentration of H+ ions after the acid has partially dissociated).\n\n[H+] = (8.314 * 4 * 10^-5 * 0.25) / (0.0004 + 0.25) = 7.875 * 10^-5 M\n\nNow we can plug this value into the equation for pH:\n\npH = -log (7.875 * 10^-5) = 3.98\n\nNote that significant figures should be used to ensure that the answer has the appropriate level of precision based on the given information.

First, we need to add 1 to the exponent to convert it to scientific notation, giving us:\n\n`pH = -0.4567 * 10^1`\n\nThen, we can move the decimal point two places to the left, giving us:\n\n`pH = -4.567 * 10^-1`\n\nFinally, we need to round to one decimal place of precision, giving us:\n\n`pH = -4.60`\n\nHowever, the pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration, which should be a positive value. So we need to flip the sign to get the correct answer:\n\n`pH = 4.60`\n\nRounding once more, we get the final answer:\n\n`pH = 4.72`\n\nThis solution was generated programmatically using the equation 1/(1 + 10^(pH - pKa))."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-17 11:15:56.281665+00:00"}
