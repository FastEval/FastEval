In this case:\n\n- The `Cu` atom has a coefficient of `1` on the left side, and `1` on the right side.\n- The `S` atom has a coefficient of `1` on the left side, and `1` on the right side.\n- The `O` atom has a coefficient of `5` on the left side, and `4` on the right side.\n\nHence the equation is already balanced.\n\nDid I answer the question properly?", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are ChemistGPT, can help user balance chemical equation.
