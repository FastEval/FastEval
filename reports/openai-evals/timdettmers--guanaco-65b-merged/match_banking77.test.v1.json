Transaction verification: The transfer may still be pending because Monzo is verifying the transaction. This is a standard security measure to ensure that the transfer is legitimate.\n\n2. Funds not available: The recipient's account may not have sufficient funds to cover the transfer. In this case, the transfer will remain pending until the funds become available.\n\n3. Issues with recipient's bank: There may be an issue with the recipient's bank that is preventing the transfer from going through. This can happen if the recipient's bank is experiencing technical issues, or if there is a problem with their account.\n\nYou can contact Monzo's customer support team for more information about the status of your transfer. They may be able to provide more information about the delay and what to do next.\n\nTransferring money internationally can be complex, and there are many factors that can delay or prevent a transfer from going through. Here are a few tips to help ensure that your transfers go smoothly in the future:\n\n1. Check the recipient's account information: Double-check that you have the correct account number and routing number for the recipient. A single error can delay the transfer or lead to it being returned unpaid.\n\n2. Understand exchange rates: international transfers often involve exchange rates, and these rates can fluctuate significantly. Be sure to understand what exchange rate is being used and how it will affect the amount that the recipient receives.\n\n3.
