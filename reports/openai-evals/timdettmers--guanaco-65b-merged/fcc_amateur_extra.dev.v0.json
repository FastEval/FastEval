A spurious emission is any emission outside the signal's necessary bandwidth that can be reduced or eliminated without affecting the information transmitted.\n\nWhich of the following identifiers is correct for an unmanned or automated station?\nA.

The station licensee name, followed by \"by\" and the call sign of the control operator D. The call sign of the controlled station, followed by \"by\" and the call sign of control operator\n\n### Assistant: The correct answer is \"D\". For an unmanned or automated station, the correct identifier is the call sign of the controlled station, followed by \"by\" and the call sign of the control operator.\n\nWhat is the ITU?\nA. International Telecommunications Union B. Industry Training and Unionizing C. International Testing of UHF D. International Traffic Union\n\n### Assistant: The correct answer is \"A\". The ITU stands for International Telecommunication Union. It is a United Nations agency responsible for issues relating to global telecommunications.\n\nWhat kind of radio emissions are not allowed during emergency and disaster situations?\nA. Frequency modulation emissions B. Spread spectrum emissions C. Narrowband emissions D. Broadband emissions\n\n### Assistant: The correct answer is \"B\". Spread spectrum emissions are not allowed during emergency and disaster situations. This is because spread spectrum emissions are intentionally wider than necessary, which can interfere with other radio communications in emergency situations.\n\nWhat is Morse code?\nA. A method of radio communication using narrowband emissions B. A method of radio communication using broadband emissions C. A method of radio communication using frequency modulation D. A method of radio communication using on-off keying of a carrier\n\n### Assistant: The correct answer is \"D\". Morse code is a method of radio communication that uses on-off keying of a carrier signal to transmit information. The on and off signals are translated into a series of dots and dashes that can be used to spell out text messages in code.\n\nIf operators are communicating internationally, which of the following must be included in the call sign exchange?\nA. The ITU prefix B. The country prefix C. The call district D. The radio class\n\n### Assistant: The correct answer is \"B\". When operators are communicating internationally, they must include the country prefix as part of the call sign exchange. This lets operators know where the other station is located and which country's regulations they are following.\n\nHow is the frequency of a radio signal changed when using frequency modulation (FM)?\nA. By shifting the phase of the carrier B. By varying the amplitude of the carrier C. By superimposing the audio signal on the carrier D. By varying the frequency of the carrier\n\n### Assistant: The correct answer is \"D\". Frequency modulation (FM) changes the frequency of the radio signal by varying the frequency of the carrier. This is done by superimposing the audio signal on the carrier, which causes the frequency of the carrier to shift in proportion to the changes in the audio signal.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) from the FCC Amateur Radio License question pool.
