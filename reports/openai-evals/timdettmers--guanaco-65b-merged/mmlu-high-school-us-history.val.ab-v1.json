Logan’s address, while expressing his grief for the loss of his family, also expressed his sadness for the loss of peace between his tribe and the colonists. The address was shared widely through the colonies and helped make his name synonymous with a Native American perspective of injustice.\n\nLogan's Address was first published in 1774, after a series of attacks by British colonists led by Michael Cresap in the Ohio Valley. Logan himself was a Mingo leader well known for his diplomacy and his efforts to maintain peace between the Mingo and the colonists. However, after the loss of his family in Cresap's attacks, he was driven to retaliation and his subsequent address to the colonists became widely known and circulated.\n\nD, the answer option you supplied, is the best response. The Address expresses Logan's grief and anger over the losses he and his people had suffered, and the injustices they had endured at the hands of the colonists. In the Address, Logan appeals to the conscience of the colonists and asks them to consider the harm they have done, both to him and to his people.\n\nThe Address was particularly popular among American readers at the time because it resonated with their own experiences of injustice and oppression at the hands of the British. Many Americans saw Logan as a symbol of the injustices they themselves had endured, and his words served as a powerful reminder of the human cost of colonial expansion. The Address became a rallying cry for those who sought to protest the treatment of Native Americans and to argue for a more just and humane approach to relations between the two peoples.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nThis question refers to the following information.\nI appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him not meat: if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not?

Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \"Logan is the friend of the white man.\" I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children.

But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n—Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nWhich author was most critical of the policy being described here by President Jackson?\nA) Rachel Carson in Silent Spring.\nB) Helen Hunt Jackson in A Century of Dishonor.\nC) William Lloyd Garrison in The Liberator.\nD) Ralph Ellison in Invisible Man.", "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-27 07:44:55.889798+00:00"}

The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n—John C.
