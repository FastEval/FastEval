King safety (25.0%): Black's king is well-defended, while White's sits in the center of the board and is vulnerable to attack.\n4.

Move flexibility (5.0%): Black can move its rook, bishop, or pawns, while White has fewer options.\nBased on these evaluations, the correct move is B, which brings the rook into a more active position.
