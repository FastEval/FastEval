While insulin does play a role in regulating glucose uptake by the brain, it is not the primary mechanism. Glucose uptake by the brain is mainly mediated by a Glut1 transporter, which does not require insulin to function.\n\n Option D is incorrect.

Fat-soluble vitamins: Vitamins A, D, E, and K are found in foods in conjunction with fats. Fat is necessary for absorption of these vitamins into the body.\n3. Cell membranes: Fats are a major component of cell membranes, where they play an important role in maintaining the structure of the cell and fluidity of the membrane.\n4. Hormone production: Fats are involved in the production of hormones that regulate various functions in the body, such as reproductive hormones and hormones that regulate inflammation.\n5. Insoluble fiber: Fat provides satiety, helping us to feel full for longer after eating.\n6. Essential fatty acids: Certain fatty acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6, are essential, meaning we need to get them from our diet. These fatty acids are important for cognitive function, heart health, and inflammation.\n7. Inflammation: Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties, and they may help to reduce the risk of chronic diseases associated with inflammation.\n8.
