The unknotting number is the number of curls plus one.\n\nThe Alexander polynomial of the knot is:\n\n-t^{2} - (t + 1) - (t^{5} - t^{4} - t^{3} + 2t^{2} - t + 1)z - (t^{8} - t^{7} - t^{6} + 2t^{5} - t^{4} - t^{3} - t + 1)z^{2} + (t^{7} - t^{6} -t^{5} + 2t^{4} - t^{3} + t - 1)z^{3} + (t^{3} - t^{2} - t + 1)z^{4} + (t - 1)z^{5} - z^{6}.\n\nThe roots of the Alexander polynomial are:\n\nz1= -.832266483, z2= -.719636168 + .674244578*I, z3= -.719636168 -.674244578*I.\n\nWe can construct a ladder diagram using the roots of the Alexander polynomial:\n\n|   |   |\n|   |   |\n|   |   | \n|   o | \n| o o | \n|   | o |\n| o o |\n| o o |\no | o |\no o o o\n\nThe number of curls in the ladder diagram is five.\n\nTherefore, the unknotting number of the knot is five.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Determine the unknotting number of the knot, represented in Dowker-Thistlethwaite code.
