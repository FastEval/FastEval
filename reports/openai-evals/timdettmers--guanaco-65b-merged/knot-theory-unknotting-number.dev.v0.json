Here are a few tips to make sure you pasted it properly, and how can you do so going forward:\n\n1. There should be no spaces between each number code.\n2. When you copy the code using Ctrl+Copy from the source, it might look like it copied correctly. But in reality, it included invisible characters (like new lines) in the clipboard that will make the code look improper when pasted. To fix this, before pasting, paste it into a blank text editor and make sure it looks fine there. Then copy it using the Copy All option (Ctrl+Shift+C), and then paste it.\n3. It seems like there are negative numbers in your code. The most common error with that is due to using a \"minus symbol\" (Unicode: U+2212) instead of a regular hyphen symbol (U+002D). You should replace all minus symbols with hyphen symbols and try again.\n\nHere is an example code for a right handed trefoil knot: 3, 2, -3, 5\n\nHope this helps!
