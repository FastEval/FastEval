A smaller error rate means that the system performs better and deviates less from the null hypothesis.\n\nConsider a test with a null hypothesis that the error rate is 0.2 and a test accuracy of 0.1. This deviates a lot from the null hypothesis, which means that a very small number of test examples is enough to get statistically significant results. For example, if the test accuracy is 0.01, the number of test examples needed is much smaller. \n\nHowever, the opposite is not correct. You can't just increase your error rate to make the number of test examples smaller.

This can be addressed by regularization or by using a simpler model with fewer parameters1. However, since the trained model has a low test error compared to the previous model, it seems the training is progressing in the right direction.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the notions of training error and test error2. The training error measures the amount of variation between predicted and actual values that the model can explain. In comparison, the test error assesses the effectiveness of the model in generalizing its predictions beyond its training data. Therefore, a model with low bias and high variance may have a low training error, yet exhibit poor performance on previously unseen data.\n\nReasons behind the model's behavior:\nhigh variance: If the model is too complex, it will be able to memorize the training data but struggle to make accurate predictions on new data. This is a situation where the variance is high, which can be remedied by using a simpler model or applying regularization techniques\nhigh estimation bias: Estimation bias occurs when the model is unable to accurately capture the underlying relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome variable. This can occur due to misspecification of the model or lack of relevant features.\n\nBased on the given information, we can exclude high estimation bias as the main reason since the model has a low training error. In addition, the discrepancy between the training and test errors suggests that the model is suffering from a high variance.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_set#Training_and_testing_error", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nYou observe the following while fitting a linear regression to the data: As you increase the amount of training data, the test error decreases and the training error increases.

The ridge regression model is a variant of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, where the least squares problem is penalized with an L2 norm of the weights to introduce a bias-variance tradeoff.  The penalty term is defined as (λ/2)*Norm(weights)2, where λ is a non-negative tuning parameter that controls the strength of the penalty. On the other hand, the Laplace prior is a distribution on the weights with density function proportional to e^(-|z|/β), where β is a hyperparameter that controls the spread of the distribution. The Laplace prior is often used in Bayesian statistics to impose sparsity on the weights. Note that L2 penalty and Laplace prior are two different things. While L2 penalty is a way to regularize the model, Laplace prior imposes a structure on the weights.\nStatement 2: True\nThere is at least one set of 4 points in R^3 that can be shattered by the hypothesis set of all 2D planes in R^3. To see this, consider the following set of 4 points: {(0,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,0,0), (0,1,0)}. Every possible 2D hyperplane in R^3 will either pass through two of these points, missing the other two, or not pass through any of the points.
