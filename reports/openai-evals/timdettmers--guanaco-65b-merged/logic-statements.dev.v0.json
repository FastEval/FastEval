Format your final answer as either YES or NO."}], "ideal": "NO"}, "sampled": "Despite being limited to set theory as given in the prompt, this problem can be solved using the concepts of sets, set intersection, complement, and a few basic logical operators. \n\nThe key point to make is that, in set theory, the statement P -> Q is equivalent to the statement !P or Q. Here we're given three sets A (oranges), B (citrus fruits), and C (sour fruits). We need to reason about whether the third statement from the prompt is logically implied by the first two. That is, whether C extends A can be determined solely based on the information we have about A, B, and the relationship between them (as described by the first two statements from the prompt). \n\nTo start, we can use the distributive property of set intersection and union to rewrite the first and second statements: \n\nA ∩ B = (A ∩ C) ∪ (A - C)\nSome B = (C ∪ (B - C))\nThese equalities can be directly inferred from the first two statements in the prompt. We can additionally infer that (B - C) is non-empty because the second statement from the prompt explicitly tells us that \"some\" citrus fruits are not sour.\n\nThe last unsolved piece from the prompt is to check whether some oranges are sour, due to it being described as A ∩ C. If we assume A - C is not empty, this question reduces down to checking A is a strict subset of C, which can be checked using a double inclusion proof by contradiction. We'll try to prove C ⊆ A first. If the left side is false (some value X from C is not in A), and we can show that this contradicts an existing constraint or assumption, then this direction of the proof will fail and we can conclude that C  lineaer subset of A.\n\nIf we get lucky, the first line of assumptions we wrote down will be enough to disprove C ⊆ A. If A ∩ B = (A ∩ C) ∪ (A - C), then it follows that C ⊆ B as well (because C is a subset of the left side of the equality, but the right side includes C itself and more elements. Due to the other line of assumptions telling us some B ≠ C, it follows that C is not a superset of B (i.e. C ⊈ B); we also hope it's not equal to B (but we'll worry about that at the end if it comes up). From there it's simple: A ⊆ C would require C ⊆ B (from above) and B ⊆ C (since both sides are intersections of B and C, and for any S and T, S ∩ T ⊆ T). But B ⊆ C contradicts the hypothesis C ⊈ B, so our proof by contradiction worked: C ∉ A.\n\nWorking on the proof C ⊇ A now, we'll need to start from scratch and give it another shot. If we don't disprove this statement right away (see the footnote), we can 'transfer' our earlier disproof of C ∈ A to show that A ∈ C. If A ∈ C, then A ∩ C = A, and we can use the second line of assumptions we wrote down to further expand: A ∩ C = (A ∩ C) ∪ (A - C) = A ∪ A - C. But the other direction, that A ∪ A - C = A ∩ C, can be proven by collapsing the lefthand side into 'A', and the righthand side into {X ∈ B  | X ∈ C} (the set of all elements X in C or not in A). And so, A = A ∪ A - C, equalling the original set A. Transitively, this problem comes down to proving the oranges A are a subset of the citrus fruit B: A ⊆ B, which we said earlier was false because B ⊆ C and A ⊈ C, giving us the contradiction we need to disprove C ⊆ A.\n\nTo conclude, the third statement can logically follow from the first and second statements of the givens if we assume nothing else. Thus the answer to the question given the prompt is YES.\n\nFootnote: One may find it curious that we don't automatically rule out C ⊇ A at the beginning because A is not the `<=` to B. The short explanation is that there are some false assumptions floating around by now: for instance, we may have falsely ruled out C = B above.
