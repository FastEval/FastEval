It also calculates the cost per kWh of electricity delivery by subtracting the customer charge and dividing the total charge (excluding the customer charge) by the number of remaining kWh (1000). The `round()` function is not used in this solution, but it can be added to round the results to 2 decimal places if desired.\n\nThe output of this code would be:\n```markdown\nsupply_cost_per_kwh: 0.0167\ndelivery_cost_per_kwh: 0.08\n```\nNote that you may need to adjust the code depending on the exact format of the user's utility bill and the specific output format required by the JSON utility.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a JSON utility that must return machine-readable JSON as output."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your job is compute the cost per kWh of electricity supply (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) and the cost per kWh of electricity delivery (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) based on the following incomplete OCR reading from a user's utility bill.
