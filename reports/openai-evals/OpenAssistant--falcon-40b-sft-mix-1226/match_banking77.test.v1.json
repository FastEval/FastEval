Exchange rate markup: Banks or ATM providers may charge a markup on the exchange rate they offer, making the rate higher than the mid-market rate. This is how they make money from foreign currency transactions.\n2. Dynamic exchange rate: The exchange rate may change while you are using the ATM, so the rate displayed at the time of the transaction may be different from the rate displayed when you initiate the transaction.\n3. Interbank rate: Banks may use different exchange rates when buying and selling foreign currency. The exchange rate offered by the ATM provider may be different from the rate used by your bank.\n4. Conversion fees: Some banks or ATM providers may charge additional conversion fees, such as transaction fees or fixed exchange rate fees, that are added to the exchange rate.\n5. Softer exchange rate: Banks may use a \"softer\" exchange rate when processing your transaction, which is not the real, bank-to-bank exchange rate. Instead, they may use this rate to make a profit on the transaction.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check your bank's exchange rates before making a foreign ATM transaction, and to understand any fees that may be charged. Additionally, it can be helpful to use a credit card or a debit card that does not charge international transaction fees, to avoid additional costs.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a classification bot.
