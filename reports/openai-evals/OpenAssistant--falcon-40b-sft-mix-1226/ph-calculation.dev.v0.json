Nevertheless, if you restate the question, I will answer it to the best of my abilities.\n\nIf the dissociation constant is 0.2, then the proton concentration at equilibrium is given by:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\nWe can solve for [H+] by the equilibrium expression for the dissociation of H+:\n\nKb (1.0x10^-14) * [H+] = [HR-]\n\nRearranging the equation and plugging in the known Kb and [HR-], we get:\n\n[H+] = (1.0x10^-14) * [HR-] / Ka\n\nAssuming Ka = 1, we get:\n\n[H+] = (1.0x10^-14) * [HR-]\n\nThen, the solution pH will be:\n\npH = -log(1x10^-14) * [HR-]\n\npH = -1.6955\n\nTherefore, the pH of this acid solution is approximately 1.6985."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-15 13:10:04.436999+00:00"}
