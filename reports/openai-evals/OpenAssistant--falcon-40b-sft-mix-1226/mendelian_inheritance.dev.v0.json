The dominant allele B masks the expression of G and T alleles, hence 4/4 Blue individuals have been produced from the cross of two blue individuals. Similarly, in the second example, the dominant allele B masks the expression of G and T alleles, and hence 1/4 of the offspring are blue, 1/2 are green, and 1/4 are turquoise.\n\nNow, let's analyze some other possibilities:\n\nBlue x Green -> 1/2 Blue 1/2 Green\n\nSolution:\n\nBB (Blue) x G_ (Green) -> 1/2 BB (Blue), 1/2 GB (Green)\n\nHere, the dominant allele B is inherited by some of the offspring, while the dominant allele G is expressed in others, resulting in a 1:1 ratio of blue and green offspring.\n\nBlue x Turquoise -> 1/4 Blue 1/4 Green 1/2 Turquoise\n\nSolution:\n\nBB (Blue) x T_ (Turquoise) -> 1/4 BB (Blue), 1/2 BT (Turquoise), 1/4 TT (Turquoise)\n\nHere, the dominant allele B is inherited by some of the offspring, while the dominant allele T is expressed in others. However, since the Turquoise color is recessive to both Blue and Green, 1/2 of the offspring will be Turquoise.\n\nIn conclusion, we have determined the possible genotypes and phenotypes of the F1 generation in a polymorphic population of beetles.
