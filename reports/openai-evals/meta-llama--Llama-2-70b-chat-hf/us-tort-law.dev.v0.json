Negligence, relying on res ipsa loquitur.\n\nRes ipsa loquitur is a doctrine that suggests that the injury or damage sustained by the plaintiff would not have occurred without the defendant's negligence. In this case, the employee's injury occurred while using the reconditioned saw that the storekeeper had provided. The saw blade, which was manufactured by Saw-Blade Company, flew to pieces while the employee was cutting a sheet of plywood. The fact that the blade was new and manufactured by a reputable company reduces the likelihood that the injury was caused by a defect in the blade. Therefore, the inference can be made that the storekeeper's negligence in reconditioning the saw or ensuring that it was in good working condition led to the accident.\n\nThe storekeeper's liability is based on the fact that he had a duty of care to ensure that the reconditioned saw was safe for use. By selling the saw as \"reconditioned,\" the storekeeper implied that it was in good working condition and suitable for its intended purpose.

While it is true that power saws can be dangerous if not used properly, the fact that the blade was manufactured by a reputable company and had been inspected for defects suggests that it was not inherently dangerous.
