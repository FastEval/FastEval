First, we need to calculate the total cost of electricity supply:\nTotal Cost = On-peak Cost + Off-peak Cost\n= 140.2 kWh x $0.25 + 200.2 kWh x $0.15\n= 35.05 + 30.03\n= 65.08\n2. Next, we calculate the total kWh consumed:\nTotal kWh = On-peak kWh + Off-peak kWh\n= 140.2 kWh + 200.2 kWh\n= 340.4 kWh\n3. Now, we can calculate the cost per kWh of electricity supply:\nCost per kWh = Total Cost / Total kWh\n= 65.08 / 340.4\n= 0.1906\n4. Rounding to 2 significant figures, we get:\nCost per kWh = 0.19\n5.
