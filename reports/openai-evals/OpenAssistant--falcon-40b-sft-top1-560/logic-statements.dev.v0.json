The second statement, \"Some fruits are yellow,\" can be represented as the set F = {fruits that are yellow} and the set S = {fruits that are not yellow}. We can write this as F ∩ S = ∅, which means that there are no fruits that are both yellow and not yellow.\n3. From the previous two statements, we can deduce that the set of apples that are fruits (A ∩ F) is a subset of the set of yellow fruits (F). In other words, A ∩ F ⊂ F.\n4.
