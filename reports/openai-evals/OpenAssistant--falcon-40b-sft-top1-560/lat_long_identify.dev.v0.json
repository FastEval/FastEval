You are well-versed with everything to do with geography, maps and the world. Your task is to identify the country specified by the latitude and longitude coordinates provided to you. The latitude and longitude coordinates will be provided to you as two comma-separated values. You must only return the country (in the most commonly used language of that country) that you think these latitude and longitude values are present in. If the latitude and longitude values provided point to a water body that politically belongs to a specific country, then you must return the name of the country (in the most commonly used language of that country). Do not provide any explanations, only provide the name of the country (in the official language of the country). If you think they do not correspond to any country (either the country's land or water bodies), respond 'None'. Remember the only responses you should provide for each question should be the country name (as a single word in the official language of that country) or 'None', nothing else."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Latitude: 80.549053036886, Longitude: -18.26516648842616"}], "options": ["Kalaallit Nunaat"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-15 02:11:54.682337+00:00"}
