Here's why:\n\nWhen you sell a put option, you create an obligation to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price if the buyer of the option exercises their right to sell the shares to you. When you buy a put option, you have the right to sell 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price.\n\nSimilarly, when you sell a call option, you create an obligation to sell 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price if the buyer of the option exercises their right to buy the shares from you. When you buy a call option, you have the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price.\n\nIn this position, you have sold a put option at a strike price of $85 and bought a put option at a strike price of $80. This means that you have created an obligation to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at $85 if the buyer of the put option exercises their right to sell the shares to you. At the same time, you have bought a put option at a strike price of $80, which gives you the right to sell 100 shares of the underlying stock at $80.\n\nYou have also sold a call option at a strike price of $85 and bought a call option at a strike price of $92. This means that you have created an obligation to sell 100 shares of the underlying stock at $85 if the buyer of the call option exercises their right to buy the shares from you. At the same time, you have bought a call option at a strike price of $92, which gives you the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at $92.\n\nTo maximize profits, you want the stock price to increase to a level that is higher than the strike price of the call option that you have sold ($85) but lower than the strike prices of both the put options that you have bought ($80 and $92). This would allow you to keep the premiums that you have received for selling the call option and the put options, without having to fulfill your obligation to buy or sell the shares at the strike prices.\n\nTherefore, an increase in the stock price would be more optimal for this position as it would result in maximum profits.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a derivatives investor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Assume all contracts are for 100 shares.
