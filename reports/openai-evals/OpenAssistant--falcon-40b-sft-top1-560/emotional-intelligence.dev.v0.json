Seeing them socially, outside of the work context, can help Rhea build stronger personal relationships with them, which in turn can provide her with a sense of belonging and support.\n\nSecondly, joining a playgroup or social group of new mothers can help Rhea meet other women who are in a similar situation as her and who can relate to her experiences and struggles of being a full-time mom. This can provide her with a new social circle and support network, which can help her feel less isolated and more connected to others. Additionally, participating in these groups can give Rhea the opportunity to engage in activities that she enjoys, make new friends, and share her experiences as a mother.\n\nIn summary, I believe that a combination of **b** and **c** would be the most effective course of action for Rhea, as it can help her maintain connections with her old workmates while also building a new social circle and support network of other mothers.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are now an emotionally intelligent AI.
