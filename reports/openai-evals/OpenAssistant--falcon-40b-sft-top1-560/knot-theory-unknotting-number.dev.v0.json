The algorithm to compute the unknotting number is based on the Dowker-Thistlethwaite theorem, which states that every crossing change is equivalent to a sequence of two moves: a Reidemeister move and a move called the flip move.\n\nHere's how you can use the Dowker-Thistlethwaite algorithm to compute the unknotting number of the given knot:\n\n1. Start with the knot represented in the Dowker-Thistlethwaite code.\n\n2. For each crossing in the knot, determine if it is positive or negative by looking at the signs of the numbers in the code. Positive crossings are indicated by positive numbers, while negative crossings are indicated by negative numbers.\n\n3. Starting from any crossing, follow the code and keep track of the moves that you make. Every time you encounter a flip move, increase the number of crossings that you have removed by 1.\n\n4. Once you have reached a dead end, backtrack to the last crossing that you removed and consider the other move that you could have made. Continue following this alternate path and keep track of the number of crossings that you have removed.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have considered all possible paths through the knot.\n\n6. The unknotting number of the knot is the minimum number of crossings that you have removed in any of the paths that you considered.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we can compute the unknotting number of the given knot as follows:\n\n1. Start with the first number in the code, which is 4. This corresponds to a positive crossing.\n\n2. Since there is no flip move immediately after this crossing, we continue to follow the code and encounter the next crossing, which is represented by the number 8. Again, there is no flip move after this crossing, so we continue to the next crossing, which is represented by the number 10.\n\n3. After this crossing, we encounter a flip move, so we backtrack to the previous crossing (10) and consider the other move that we could have made. If we had chosen this alternate path, we would have encountered the next crossing (-16) and then a flip move, so we would have removed 2 crossings (10 and -16) in this path.\n\n4. Continuing to follow the code, we encounter another positive crossing represented by the number 2. There is no flip move after this crossing, so we continue to the next crossing, which is represented by the number -18.\n\n5. After this crossing, we encounter another flip move, so we backtrack to the previous crossing (2) and consider the other move that we could have made. If we had chosen this alternate path, we would have encountered the next crossing (-20) and then a flip move, so we would have removed 2 crossings (-20 and -18) in this path.\n\n6. Continuing to follow the code, we encounter another positive crossing represented by the number -6. There is no flip move after this crossing, so we continue to the next crossing, which is represented by the number -24.\n\n7. After this crossing, we encounter another flip move, so we backtrack to the previous crossing (-6) and consider the other move that we could have made. If we had chosen this alternate path, we would have encountered the next crossing (-22) and then a flip move, so we would have removed 2 crossings (-22 and -20) in this path.\n\n8. Continuing to follow the code, we encounter another positive crossing represented by the number -14. There is no flip move after this crossing, so we continue to the next crossing, which is represented by the number -12.\n\n9. After this crossing, we encounter another flip move, so we backtrack to the previous crossing (-14) and consider the other move that we could have made. If we had chosen this alternate path, we would have encountered the next crossing (-10) and then a flip move, so we would have removed 2 crossings (-10 and -12) in this path.\n\n10. Continuing to follow the code, we encounter another positive crossing represented by the number -12. There is no flip move after this crossing, so we have reached a dead end and must backtrack to the last crossing that we removed (-14).\n\n11.
