Assuming the tax rate is the same as 2021, and based on that information, your total federal income tax for a $100,000 income would be $26,393. Here's the calculation:\n\nFirst, determine your taxable income (your income minus any deductions or exemptions):\n$100,000 - $12,550 (standard deduction) = $87,450\n\nThen, tax brackets work by applying a specific tax rate to each portion of your income within a specific range. The 2021 tax brackets for single filers are as follows:\n\n0%: up to $9,950\n10%: $9,951 - $40,125\n12%: $40,126 - $85,525\n22%: $85,526 - $163,300\n24%: $163,301 - $207,350\n32%: $207,351 - $523,600\n35%: over $523,600\n\nNext, apply the appropriate tax rates to each portion of your taxable income to get your taxable income within each bracket:\n\nFirst $9,950 of taxable income: taxed at 0% ($9,950 x 0% = $0)\n$9,951 - $40,125 of taxable income: taxed at 10% ($30,174 x 10% = $3,017.40)\n$40,126 - $85,525 of taxable income: taxed at 12% ($45,474 x 12% = $5,431.68)\n$85,526 - $163,300 of taxable income: taxed at 22% ($67,774 x 22% = $14,897.88)\n$163,301 - $207,350 of taxable income: taxed at 24% ($43,049 x 24% = $10,377.76)\n\nFinally, add up the total taxes within each bracket, and apply the lower of the new 24% bracket rate or the old 22% rate to the remaining portion of your taxable income that is over $163,300:\n\nTaxed at 22%:\n$207,351 - $207,350 of taxable income = $0\n$207,351 x 22% = $45,673.22\n\nTaxed at 24%:\n$207,351 - $163,300 of taxable income = $44,051\n$44,051 x 24% = $10,805.84\n\nAdd up the total taxes within each bracket:\n$3,017.40 + $5,431.68 + $14,897.88 + $10,377.76 + $45,673.22 + $10,805.84 = $88,879.58\n\nSubtract tax credits and deductions (such as the standard deduction, personal exemptions, and other tax credits) from your total tax liability to get your final tax liability:\n$88,879.58 - $12,550 (standard deduction) = $76,329.58\n\nApply the appropriate tax rate to your final tax liability to get your total federal income tax:\n$76,329.58 x 0.24 = $18,306.61\n\nTherefore, your total federal income tax for a $100,000 income in San Francisco would be $18,306.61.
