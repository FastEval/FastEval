On the other hand, an Appeal to Authority occurs when something is accepted as true simply based on who says it - even if no proof or evidence was given - like assuming that a famous celebrity is automatically qualified to endorse a political candidate just based on who they are, regardless of whether or not the celeb actually knows anything about politics.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhen someone is aware of evidence that contradicts her claim, but doesn't consider that evidence when making her argument, she may have committed which of the following fallacies?\nA) appeal to pride\nB) appeal to authority\nC) slippery slope\nD) suppressed evidence", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-18 04:13:35.890042+00:00"}

However, it can sometimes lead to oversimplification of complex issues, so it should not be used alone but rather in conjunction with other arguments.\n\nReducing to absurdity may involve exaggeration or distortion of an opposing viewpoint to make it seem more extreme than it actually is. For example, if someone were to argue against same-sex marriage on religious grounds, their position might be reduced to absurdity by suggesting that they are opposed to all forms of marriage between people who hold different belief systems. This would be an overstatement of their actual position and could potentially undermine their argument.

Appeal to Authority involves argument from the opinion or position of an authority. This fallacy occurs in cases where the person making an argument neglects sound arguments and simply appeals to an authority's opinion without considering whether this opinion is actually well-supported by factual evidence. (It may also occur when one party in a discussion calls upon some supposed authority for support.) An argumentum ad verecundiam (\"appeal to respect\") is an informal fallacy committed when one attempts to use the opinion of an authority as an argument for something. This fallacy is not committed if the authority being cited is an expert who can reliably verify facts; such appeal to authority is known asArgumentum ab auctoritate). However, sometimes even experts have biases that distort their perception of data.\n\nEven if a majority of authorities supports an idea, appealingto authority may still constitute an Argumentum Ad Populam. The validity of an argument depends solely on its intrinsic factors (rather than extrinsic ones), namely: The conclusion reached logicallyfrom premises.\nFor these reasons, any form of argumentation which relies solely upon the qualifications and/or word of authority figures can only be considered persuasive rather than truly convincing.
