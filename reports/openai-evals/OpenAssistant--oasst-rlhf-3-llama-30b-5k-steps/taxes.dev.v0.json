The correct answer is C.\n\nYour federal income tax will be calculated as follows:\n\nFirst, you must determine the amount of your taxable income. To do this, you will subtract the standard deduction ($12,550 for single filers in 2021) from your gross income of $50,000, giving you a taxable income of $37,450.\n\nNext, you will calculate your income tax liability by referring to the federal income tax brackets for 2021. In 2021, the federal income tax brackets were:\n\n* 10% on taxable income up to $9,325\n* 12% on taxable income between $9,326 and $37,450\n* 22% on taxable income between $37,451 and $87,850\n* 24% on taxable income between $87,851 and $163,300\n* 32% on taxable income between $163,301 and $207,350\n* 35% on taxable income above $207,350\n\nYou can see that the amount of your taxable income falls within the 22% bracket. Therefore, the amount of your federal income tax liability is $7,456 (22% of $37,450).\n\nNext, you will add any state income tax that you owe. The state tax rate for California in 2021 was 9.3%, so your state income tax liability will be $4,841 (9.3% of $53,450).\n\nYour total income tax liability, then, is $12,297 ($7,456 federal plus $4,841 state).
