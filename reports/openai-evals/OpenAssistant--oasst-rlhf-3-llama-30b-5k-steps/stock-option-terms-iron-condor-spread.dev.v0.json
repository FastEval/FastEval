The investor is selling a put at a higher strike price (27) while simultaneously buying a put at a lower strike price (25). This is a strategy used to benefit from a decrease in stock price. Since the investor is also selling a call at a higher strike price (33) while simultaneously buying a call at a lower strike price (34), it is safe to assume that he is hedging his position in case the stock price increases. Note that the investor is not breaking even until the stock price decreases below $27. This strategy is commonly used when the investor expects that the stock price will drop in the future but wants to gain some protection if the stock price increases unexpectedly.\n\nBear Put Spread.\n\nNote: Based on the prices of the contracts, the bear put spread seems to be a bullish strategy, but it is important to consider the hedge with selling a call and buying a call, which reduces bearing consequences for the investor if there is a price rising during the period of analyzing that bearing position for the investor. Note that the income from selling the call is lower than bearing consequences for buying a put. It depends on how investor hedges this strategy bearing consequences for buying a put.
