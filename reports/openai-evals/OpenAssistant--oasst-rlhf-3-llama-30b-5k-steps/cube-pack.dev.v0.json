Convert the dimensions of the box to the same unit of measurement as the dimensions of the cubes. Let's assume we convert everything to meters.\n2. Find the volume of each cube by multiplying its length, width, and height. In this case, the volume of each cube is 0.6m x 0.7m x 0.4m = 0.144 cubic meters.\n3. Find the volume of the box by multiplying its length, width, and height. The volume of the box is 1.6m x 0.5m x 0.6m = 0.48 cubic meters.\n4. Now, we need to figure out how many cubes can fit inside the box. We can do this by dividing the volume of the box by the volume of each cube.\n\nVolume of the box: 0.48 cubic meters\nVolume of each cube: 0.144 cubic meters\n\nSo, we have:\n0.48 cubic meters ÷ 0.144 cubic meters/cube = 3.333 cubes (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nSince the answer is a non-integer number with a lot of decimal places, we need to round it to the nearest whole number. In this case, the answer is either 3 cubes or 4 cubes, depending on the rounding method we use. However, when we round 3.333 to the nearest whole number, we get 3 cubes.
