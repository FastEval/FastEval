To translate this statement into a formal logical system, we would need to define a few key terms and their relationships. We would also need to establish a set of rules for inference and proof. It may be possible to codify statements using boolean logic, for instance, but the specifics of how to do so would depend on the context and the language being used. It's worth noting that while it is possible to express statements in formal logic, it is not always the best or only approach. Sometimes, it may be more natural or more insightful to frame a problem or examines a topic using an informal approach. However, it is always depend on the type of problems and the context you are working on.\n\nIt is worth noting, \"finished school\" is a vague phrase that could have many possible meanings. For instance, it might, refer to a specific level of education, or it might refer to any level of schooling, or It might depend on where you live or what is the expectations, it could also, refer to a specific field of study.\nIt is also worth noting that \"Have, finished, and school\" are nouns and also verbs. In \"more kids have finished school than you have.\" the word \"have\" has different meanings. It, usually, means possession, but here it means finished, which means it's a verb, Instead of meaning possession, The noun \"Finished\" has different meanings. It, usually, means that the process of doing or completing something has ended, but it might, here, mean possession of a degree or any form of accomplishment.\nThe noun, \"School\" is a noun that refers to a place for learning, usually,, it refers to a building where children receive education. It might, here mean, an institution, or it might, here, mean a building.\n\nIt's worth noting, \"Kids, you, and finished\" are nouns and pronouns, and their usage here might be ambiguous. It, also, depend on where you live or what is expectations.\nThe noun, \"kids\" is a noun that refers to children.
