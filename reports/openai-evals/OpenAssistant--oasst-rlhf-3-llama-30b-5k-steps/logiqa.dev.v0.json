Since the launch of the Chang'e-2 satellite in October 2010, it has achieved successivezonying of the Earth, and through a large number of technical tests and scientific research tasks, it has fully validated 12 new technologies and 7 innovations in meeting the challenge of traveling millions of miles through space. The reliability and real-time control technology of the vehiclerunning and guidance technology, as well as the terminal plunge and target meeting technology, have fully validated the core environmental design and corresponding reliability of the projectile meeting a challenge of travel millions of miles through space. Therefore, it can be seen that the success of the Chang'e-2 project not only brings the country a qualitative leap in aerospace equipment and technology, but also brings corresponding progress in related fields such as environment and scientific research.

It is a black-and-white image taken at 18:00 on October 28th and captured by a satellite about 18.7km from the moon's surface. The return of the camera indicates that the goals of the six projects set by the Chang'e-2 mission have all been achieved, which means that the Chang'e-2 project has been a complete success. The return of the camera indicates that the goals of the six projects set by the Chang'e-2 mission have all been achieved, which means that the Chang'e-2 project has been a complete success. The return of the camera indicates that the goals of the six projects set by the Chang'e-2 mission have all been achieved, which means that the Chang'e-2 project has been a complete success. It is understood that in the future, there will also be a CCD camera on the Chang'e-3 lander. At that time, it will not only take pictures, but also independently avoid the places where the lander is not suitable for landing during the soft landing, and the \"immediate decision\" will choose a flat surface suitable for landing for the lander.Question: Which of the following options is most in line with the main point of view of the following statement?\nA. A.It takes about 10 days for the local image of the lunar Hongwan area taken by Chang'e-2 to be transmitted to Earth.\nB. B.High-resolution shooting of the lunar Hongwan area is the only mission of Chang'e-2.\nC. C.While in a 100-kilometer circular orbit, Chang'e-2 took a local image of the Hongwan area of the moon.\nD. D.Chang'e-2 took local images of the lunar Hongwan area while orbiting the moon in an elliptical orbit.\nAnswer:"}], "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-17 19:02:53.156987+00:00"}
