Culture is most often seen as learned rather than invented adaptations or strategies for survival, which are not genetically determined. The use of the term 'invention' presupposes that we understand the physical'mind' as well-known. In turn 'genetically-determined' suggests a direct or at least relatively easy means to the expression of learned behaviour which would again depend on our understanding of 'the mind'. (Source: 'Themes in Archaeology - the politics of archaeology', David W. Berming and Stephen L. Tylecote, Unwin Hyman Ltd, London, 1992, p57/8)\n\nSince we cannot say that any form of culture exists because of the'mind,' and that meaning lies in the experience between culture and people, it must also be true that no culture itself can be said to be 'genetically-determined', because that would also require a knowledge of the'mind'. Instead of theorising over the inner-workings of the so-called 'blank slate' of the past, archaeologists can learn about a culture by examining how material items and symbolic goods, and in turn how they relate to the landscape and the rest of the culture, affect human meaning and behaviour.\n\nFor example, an old, decorated baking tray may be used as a serving tray or wall decoration, but its existence is not the only factor in how one perceives it as a piece of art work or symbol of some sort. Context is key to understanding symbolic goods.

However, inferences about their potential language and vocabulary can be drawn from their cognitive and social behaviors, as well as the archaeological evidence of their tools, technology and cultural practices.\n\nBased on the archaeological record, evidence of early stone tool technology and use suggests some degree of planning, coordination and communication among hominins. The manufacture and use of stone tools required a level of hand dexterity, motor control and visual perception, which suggests that early Homo taxa had well-developed central nervous systems. The complexity of stone tool technology also suggests that early Homo taxa had the capacity to learn, innovate, and pass on this knowledge to others, which implies a degree of social learning and communication.\n\nIt is also important to note that the development of language and vocabulary in early hominins is not a simple or straightforward process. Language is a complex and dynamic system that emerges from a combination of biological, social and environmental factors (Wray, 2010; Corballis, 2014).
