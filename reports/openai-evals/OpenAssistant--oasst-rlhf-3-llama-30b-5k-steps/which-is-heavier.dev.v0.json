The density of cast iron at room temperature is 7.2 g/cm³, which is roughly 7 times as heavy as silk with density 0.9 - 1.3 g/cm³. At 0.8 pound, cast iron has at least 8 to 9 times greater mass than the silk. By volume, iron has even 19 times greater owned volume than silk. Although the volume of silk may increase due to to multiplicity in weaving, the argument still holds as at least iron has 10 to 1 owned volume.

Besides, at 0.8 pound, cast iron owned volume has at least 8 to 9 times greater mass than the iron threads weaved as to have a owned volume twice of the silk. In conclusion, 1 pound of cast iron has at least 8 to 9 times greater owned volume than the spider silk, which owns mass of 3 pounds.
