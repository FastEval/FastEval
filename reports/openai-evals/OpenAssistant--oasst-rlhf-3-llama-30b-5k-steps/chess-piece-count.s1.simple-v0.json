I think you should try to evaluate the board using chess engines and you will find useful some lines that you can play using more advanced moves like Nd4 and pushing later the e-pawn furthermore. They should give some evaluation of the resulting middle-game you are going to play, and then based on the result you should decide what further moves to play.\n\nRegards, ChessGPT."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-17 18:55:30.823987+00:00"}
