Even though all red wine is in the set of wine, it does not imply that all characteristics of the set of wine are in the set of red wine. Just because some wine is fruity, does not mean that red wine is fruity. In fact, red wine is a subset of wine and in order to know its characteristics, you would only be able to say something like: all red wine is red. \nThat being said, it is reasonable to assume that most red wine is fruity because of the characteristics of the other wines that are also in the set of red wine. However, it is not true by deduction that a red wine is fruity based on this line of reasoning. Another example to think about is whether or not all snow is a cigarette. Just because only some cigarettes are smoked in snowy places, does not mean a cigarette is always in a snowy place.\n\nOne thing to note is that when you are only looking to collect statistics on whether or not pieces in a set have certain characteristics, you would only be looking at the portion of the set that meets your criteria. This line of reasoning would only be applicable when you want to say that pieces in a set have certain characteristics. Also, only when dealing with statistics, would you be able to collect statistics on whether or not pieces in a set have certain characteristics. Also, only when dealing with statistics, would you be able to collect statistics on whether a certain piece of pieces in a set has certain characteristics. Also, only when dealing with statistics, would you be able to collect statistics on whether or not a certain piece of a collective doesn't have pieces in a set. \nThat being said, when dealing with statistics, you can also say that pieces in a set has certain characteristics.
