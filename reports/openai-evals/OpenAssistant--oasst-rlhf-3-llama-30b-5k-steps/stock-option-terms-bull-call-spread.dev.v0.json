It involves selling an out-of-the-money (OTM) call option while simultaneously buying an OTM put option for the same underlying stock. The idea behind a married put strategy is to hedge the potential loss in the underlying stock by selling a call option with a higher strike price, while buying a put option to protect against a decline in the stock price. This offsetting position is called a \"marriage\" because it aims to provide overall protection to offset any potential loss in the stock. This strategy is often used by investors who want to own the stock but want to limit their potential loss if the stock price drops. In a married put strategy, the investor will typically sell the call option with the stock price relatively high, and buy the put option with a higher exercise price near the stock price or slightly above it, usually out-of-the-money. The hope is that the overall cost of the strategy is lower than having to buy the stock outright. The goal of the married put strategy is to make a profit from selling the call option while exercising the put option to sell the stock at a higher price point.
