When I walked into the restaurant I could at once see that it was inspired by the canal of glasshouses that were a symbol of modern bahrain. Through the large clocks and Jamie Oliver cookbooks the woman at the desk asked if I wanted to sit at the bar, I said yes please and took my shoes and socks of to enter the Holy Sanctrine of sports souls and large chesterfields.

While I looked to my left, a friendly sandy-haired waiter came with his notepad and politely greeted me and asked for my order, I roughly knew what I wanted so after a while I came around to asking for their vegetarian burger, the waiter nodded and greeted me with his cheerful \"great\" and asked if I wanted sides and which drink I would order, I naturally ordered water since I had it with me, however they charged extra for this which i found quite unorthodox but nevermind, I sat and waited for what was to come, not long after a massive beefy construction worker came in and ordered his kids meal, and the waiter floated around him and served him before the other customers around me who stormook the opportunity to order more drinks through him while I just smiled eternally until I finally recieved my meal, it came with the beverage and the straws but notably the fries were missing, \"no problem\" I thought to myself. All in all, it was an interesting and mildly amusing visit to Belgo, especially with my vegetarian burger, which felt like a new addition, however I would visit again because I know the service is jolly good if not a bit slow.

My girlfriend informed me we were vegan and I threw out my greek yogurt and chicken salad. She looked at me like I was dumb, admitting to the fact she only meant she was vegan to test me and see if I'd throw out the greek yogurt.

Through the large clocks and Jamie Oliver cookbooks the woman at the desk asked if I wanted to sit at the bar, I said yes please and took my shoes and socks of to enter the Holy Sanctrine of sports souls and large chesterfields. As I settled in, I noticed to my left a large stage with a strange golden design which I only later found out stood for a pineapple, in fact every 3 minutes the lights for the pineapple went on, nobody seems to bat an eyelid however.
