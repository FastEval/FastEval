In this situation, there are a few possible actions that Katerina could take, and different options might be more effective depending on Katerina's relationship with her sister, how she typically responds to criticism, and other factors.\n\nThat being said, if Katerina is able to have a strong sense of self and healthy boundaries, and if her sister's comments are relatively rare, then it might be most effective for Katerina to simply ignore her sister's comments and continue with the task at hand. This involves standing up for oneself in a quiet and strong way, without becoming defensive or escalating the situation.\n\nAlternatively, if Katerina struggles with assertiveness or if her sister is particularly critical or toxic, it might be more effective for Katerina to ask her sister to help or to do it herself. This could help to defuse the situation and to avoid further criticism.\n\nTelling her sister that she is being mean might also be an effective response, as it could help to set boundaries and to communicate that such behavior is not acceptable.\n\nFinally, if Katerina struggles with assertiveness or if her sister is particularly critical or toxic, it might be most effective for Katerina to avoid working appliances in front of her sister or family again, as this could help to avoid future confrontations.\n\nOverall, the most effective response for Katerina depends on a number of factors, and there is no single \"right\" answer.
