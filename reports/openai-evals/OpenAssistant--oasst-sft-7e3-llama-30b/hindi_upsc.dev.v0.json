The force on the bag is equal to its weight, which is 76 kg in this case.\n\nThere are three forces acting on the bag: the force of gravity (mg), the reaction force from the Earth (N), and the buoyancy force from the surrounding air (B). The sum of these three forces must be equal to the weight of the bag:\n\nFg + Fn + Fb = mg + N + B = KE\n\nwhere Fg is the force of gravity, Fn is the reaction force from the Earth, Fb is the buoyancy force from the air, and m is the mass of the bag and person.\n\nLet's take each force one by one:\n\n1. Force of Gravity (Fg): The force of gravity is equal to the product of the mass of the bag and person and the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately 9.8 m/s^2.\nFg = mg = (KEKE + PW) * 9.8 m/s^2 = 76 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 742.4 N\n\n1. Reaction Force from the Earth (Fn): The reaction force from the Earth is equal and opposite to the force exerted by the bag on the Earth. Since the bag is on the Earth's surface, the reactive force is directed upward.\nKEKE + PW\nFn = -Fg = -742.4 N\n\n1. Buoyancy Force from the Air (B): The buoyancy force is a result of the pressure of the air surrounding the bag. The force is equal to the product of the volume of the displaced air and the pressure of the air. Since the bag is in a room with essentially atmospheric pressure, the buoyancy force is approximately zero.
