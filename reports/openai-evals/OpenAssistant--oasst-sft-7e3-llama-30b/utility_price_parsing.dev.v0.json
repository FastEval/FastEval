Then, it calculates the cost per kWh of electricity supply by first calculating the total energy charge without the residential charge, and then dividing it by 0.00. Finally, it adds the supply cost per kWh and rounds it to 2 decimal places.\n\nNext, it calculates the cost per kWh of electricity delivery by dividing the total energy charge by 1000.00. It rounds the result to 2 decimal places, and adds the delivery cost per kWh.
