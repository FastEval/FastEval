The datasheet typically provides information on the dependency of key parameters of the transistor with temperature, including its maximum rating and derating.\n\nThe thermal derating, or temperature coefficient, is typically expressed in relation to a reference temperature, such as 25°C or 100°C. To determine the derating at T_C=100°C, you would refer to the manufacturer's derating curves and find the maximum allowable current for a transistor operating at 100°C.\n\nOnce you have the derating value, you can calculate the thermal derating percentage. Let's assume that the maximum rating of the IRF540N transistor at T_C=100°C is 3.0 A, while its maximum rating at T_C=25°C is 4.0 A. The derating value can be calculated as follows:\n\nDerating = (Max rating at T_C=25°C - Max rating at T_C=100°C) / Max rating at T_C=25°C\nDerating = (4.0 A - 3.0 A) / 4.0 A\nDerating = 0.25, or 25%\n\nTherefore, the thermal derating of an IRF540N transistor at T_C=100°C is 25%.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are to answer each given question with a single number, with no extra characters or units.
