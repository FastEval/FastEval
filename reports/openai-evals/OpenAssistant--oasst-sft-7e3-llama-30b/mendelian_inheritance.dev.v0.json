The phenotype of the offspring will depend on which genotypes are present. If BB and BG are both present, the offspring will have a 3:1 ratio of Blue to Turquoise. If BB and TG are both present, the offspring will have a 3:1 ratio of Blue to Green. If BG and TG are both present, the offspring will have a 1:1 ratio of Blue to Green. The genotypes of the parents and offspring are:\n\nBlue x Blue -> 3/4 Blue 1/4 Turquoise\n\nPossible genotypes:\n\n* BB (Blue) x BG (Blue) -> 2/4 BB (Blue), 2/4 BG (Blue), 0 TG (Green)\n* BB (Blue) x TG (Green) -> 2/4 BB (Blue), 0 BG (Blue), 2/4 TG (Green)\n* BG (Blue) x TG (Green) -> 2/4 BB (Blue), 2/4 BG (Blue), 2/4 TG (Green)\n\nNote that the exact genotypes of the parents and offspring cannot be determined without additional information about the frequency of each genotype in the population.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "One type of beetle has 3 possible wing colors, blue, green and turquoise.
