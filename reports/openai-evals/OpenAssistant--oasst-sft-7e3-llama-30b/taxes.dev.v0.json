For 2021, the tax brackets for single filers are as follows:\n\n10% up to $9,525\n12% from $9,526 to $39,400\n22% from $39,401 to $87,850\n24% from $87,851 to $166,075\n32% from $166,076 to $207,350\n35% from $207,351 to $518,400\n37% over $518,400\n\nSince $75,000 is less than $207,350, we know it falls into either the 24% or 32% bracket. We can use the formula for the income tax to find out which bracket it falls into:\n\nIncome tax = Total income * Tax rate\n\nFor the 24% bracket, the tax rate is 24% / 100% = 0.24, and for the 32% bracket, the tax rate is 32% / 100% = 0.32.\n\nTo find which bracket $75,000 falls into, we can calculate the tax for each bracket up to $75,000:\n\n$9,526 x 0.10 = $952.60 (first bracket)\n($39,401 - $9,526) x 0.12 = $4,750.92 (second bracket)\n($87,851 - $39,401) x 0.22 = $15,788.22 (third bracket)\n($166,076 - $87,851) x 0.24 = $41,811.68 (fourth bracket)\n\nSince none of these brackets reach $75,000, we know that $75,000 falls into the next bracket.\n\nTo find the total tax, we add up all the previous bracket taxes:\n\n$952.60 + $4,750.92 + $15,788.22 + $41,811.68 = $62,342.82\n$75,000 - $62,342.82 = $2,657.18\n\nSince $2,657.18 is less than $7,000, which is the first tax bracket for married filers, we know that our answer must be between $18,282 and $23,001.
