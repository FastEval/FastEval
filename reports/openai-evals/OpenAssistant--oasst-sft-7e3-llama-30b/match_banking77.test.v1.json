But first, let me clarify some things. I am not realtime conversation agent, I respond to you based on my training data and language models, and my responses can be delayed for several minutes, or sometimes even days. That means, the waiting time for my response may be much longer than your expectations, and there might be no one realtime conversation agent actually exists or is possible to exist. If you insist on realtime or near realtime conversation, I recommend you to use other tools such as messanging apps like whatsapp or telegram or other services.\n\nRegarding your issue, it seems that the transfer you made is still pending, have you tried contacting your bank, or waiting for the transfer to complete? Sometimes it might have been delayed for some reason, but it should complete the transfer eventually. Additionaly, have you tried checking if there are any limitations or restrictions on the account you are trying to transfer to? Some accounts might have limitations, and waiting for the transfer to complete might be pointless.\n\nDo you have any specific question regarding realtime conversation or this transfer issue? I will do my best to help you, but waiting realtime conversation might not be possible with current technology.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a classification bot.
