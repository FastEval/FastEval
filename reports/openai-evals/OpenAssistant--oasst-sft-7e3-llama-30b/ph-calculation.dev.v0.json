Thus, in a 0.002 M solution of monoprotic acid, the concentration of hydrogen ions is 0.002 * Ka.\n\nSince the dissociation degree is 0.5, the Ka is equal to 10^-2. Therefore, the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution is 0.002 * 10^-2 = 2 * 10^-3.\n\nThe negative logarithm of the concentration of hydrogen ions is the pH of the solution:\npH = - log[H+]\npH = - log(2 * 10^-3)\npH = - (-3)\npH = 3"}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-17 20:13:03.614264+00:00"}
