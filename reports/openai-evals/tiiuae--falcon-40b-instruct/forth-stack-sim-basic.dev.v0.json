The expected stack representation should be: <code>(stack 3 2 2 1 1 1)</code>. \n\nThe reason why the response is incorrect is that <code>drop</code> removes the second (2) element from the stack, which should be 3 in this case. To fix this, you need to replace <code>drop</code> with <code>drop nip</code> to remove an element from the stack without popping it. \n\nYour updated code:\n\n<pre><code>1 2 3 swap drop nip\n</code></pre>\n\nOutputs:\n\n<pre><code>(stack 3 2 2 1 1 1 )</code></pre>\n\nTherefore, the updated set of rules for your ForthGPT program would be:\n\n1.

You can also replace it with a valid ANS Forth word that does not have this issue. For example:\n\n<pre><code>{...}&gt;extend\n</code></pre>\n\nIn this prompt, the ForthGPT program encounters the invalid ANS Forth word <code>{...}</code>.
