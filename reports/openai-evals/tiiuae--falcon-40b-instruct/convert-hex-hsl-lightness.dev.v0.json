Light colors are generally perceived to be more positive and energetic, while darker colors tend to be more serious and subdued. Knowing the lightness value can also help designers create color schemes that are cohesive and visually appealing. For example, using colors with similar lightness values can create a harmonious look, while using colors with different lightness values can create a more dynamic and interesting design. In addition, knowing the lightness value of different colors can also be useful when working with clients or stakeholders who have specific preferences or requirements for the project.
