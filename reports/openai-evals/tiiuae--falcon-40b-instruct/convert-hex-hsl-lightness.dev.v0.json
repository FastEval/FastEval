Accessibility: Lightness values play a crucial role in designing for people with visual impairments and color blindness. Certain color combinations can make it difficult for users to interpret content, and having the right lightness value can help improve readability and legibility.\n\n2. Branding: Colors are a vital part of branding and creating a unique identity for a brand. By using the correct lightness values, designers can create a cohesive and memorable visual identity that helps consumers recognize and connect with the brand.\n\n3. User interface design: The right lightness value can significantly impact the user experience and usability of a website or mobile app. By using the correct lightness values, designers can create a UI that is easy to read and navigate, and which helps users find the information they need more quickly.\n\n4. Mood and emotions: Lightness values can also play a role in creating the right mood and emotions for a website or mobile app. By using the right lightness values, designers can create something that is visually appealing, but more importantly, that helps users to feel a certain way when interacting with the website or app.\n\n5.

HSL (Hue, Saturation, and Luminance) is a color space that defines color by three values: Hue, which is the color itself; Saturation, which is how much of the color is present; and Luminance, which is how bright the color is. Each of these values range from 0 to 100, with 0, 50, and 100 being the minimum, middle, and maximum values respectively.\n\nConverting from hex code to HSL involves mapping the hex code to its corresponding hue value on the color wheel, and then adjusting the saturation and luminance values to match the saturation and brightness of the original hex color. This results in a corresponding HSL value that we can then use to determine the lightness value of the hex code.\n\nFor example, the hex code #721cb6 has a hue value of 198.5 or 194 in HSL (the hue value in HSL wraps around to 360 when it exceeds that value). This hue value corresponds to a color that is slightly greenish-blue (or bluish-green) in nature. Similarly, the hex code #178e0b has a hue value of 173.5 or 180 in HSL (again, the hue value wraps around to 360 when it exceeds that value), corresponding to a color that is slightly greenish-blue as well.
