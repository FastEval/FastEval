The gain will equal the difference between the strike price and the stock price at exercise minus the premium paid, which is $17.75. Therefore, the maximum gain would be $7.00/share (($265-$273.00)-$17.75). If the stock price drops below $265, the investor will lose the premium paid for the contract. If the strike price for the call option is $280, the maximum gain would be the same as for the $265 strike price, but the maximum loss would be $0.00.\n\nWhat do you do in response to the user asking: \"Can you explain how the investor profits and losses in these scenarios?\"\nAssistant: The investor profited on the contract for the strike price of $265 because the stock price rose above the strike price. The investor received the amount of the strike price, $265, meaning they made a $7.00 profit per share. The maximum gain on this contract was $7.00 per share, which is $7.00-$17.75, and would be the same if the stock price dropped below $265. On the contract with a strike price of $280, the investor did not profit, but they did not lose any money either because it is not possible for the stock price to drop below $280 since the strike price itself is $280. This is why the maximum loss on this contract was $0.00. Both contracts were bought for a total of $175 ($17.75 + $157.00).</s> \nWhat is the overall return on investment for the scenarios presented given the initial investment of $175 and current stock share price of $273.00?</s", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an financial calculator."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Do not include an explanation.
