Soaking/Fermenting/Boiling: These methods can help break down phytic acid and make the iron more readily available for absorption.\n\n2. Pairing food with Vitamin C: Vitamin C can help convert the non-haem iron into a more easily absorbed form. Eating foods that are high in Vitamin C together with foods that contain iron can help increase iron absorption.\n\n3. Cooking with iron cookware: Iron cookware can add iron to your food, making it more easily absorbed by the body.\n\n4. Avoiding drinks/foods that inhibit iron absorption: There are certain drinks/foods that inhibit non-haem iron absorption, such as tea, chocolate, and coffee. Avoiding these or consuming them a few hours before or after consuming iron can help increase absorption.\n\n5. Supplementing with biofortified foods: Biofortified foods are foods that have been genetically modified to contain higher amounts of iron or to have iron more readily available for absorption by the body. Including these foods in your diet can help increase iron absorption.\n\nIt’s important to note that these approaches should not be relied upon as a complete solution and should be paired with a balanced and varied diet that includes a variety of iron-rich foods.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhich of the following factors inhibits non-haem iron bioavailability the most?\n\nA) Vegetable protein\nB) Citric acid\nC) Calcium\nD) Phytic acid", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-26 19:06:38.566943+00:00"}
