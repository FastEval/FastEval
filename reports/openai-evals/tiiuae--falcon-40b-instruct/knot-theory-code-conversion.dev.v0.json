By navigating this graph, it is possible to identify different knots that have the same Gauss code but distinct Dowker-Thistlethwaite code values. This can be useful in certain fields such as topology and mathematics where the properties of knots are of significant interest.\n\nThe advantages of using the Dowker-Thistlethwaite code over the Gauss code include:\n\n- The Dowker-Thistlethwaite code is a more informative and detailed representation of knots compared to the Gauss code. It captures the topology and geometry of the knot more accurately.\n- The Dowker-Thistlethwaite code can be used to distinguish between knots that have the same Gauss code but distinct properties, which can be important in areas of mathematics and physics where knot theory is essential.\n- The Dowker-Thistlethwaite code can provide insights to the mathematical properties of knots, such as their classification, invariants, and properties.
