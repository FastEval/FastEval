This is known as a command injection attack, and it can be used to steal data, install malware, or execute other damaging actions.\n\n3. SQL injection: When a user inputs code into a database query, it is possible for that code to run unintended queries, allowing attackers to access or modify sensitive data.\n\n4. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF): This involves exploiting a user's authenticated session or cookies to perform unauthorized actions on their behalf.\n\n5.

Check for suspicious links - hover over the links to see the real URL, and be wary of suspicious or unfamiliar websites. \n5. Use a secure email client - use a reputable and secure email client that has built-in security features to detect and block suspicious emails. \n6.
