We can use a sorting algorithm called insertion sort to sort the numbers in a descending order.\n\nTo do this, we start by comparing each number in the list with the one after it.

We repeat this process until the entire list is sorted.\n\nIn this specific case, we need to ignore any formatting or leading zeros in the numbers.
