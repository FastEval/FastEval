To overcome this limitation, developers may need to write custom code to generate more complex prompts that include more input options, or use existing tools that have been created specifically for this purpose. Additionally, using only a custom prompt may not provide the user with the sense of interaction they may expect in a dialogue-driven system, which could make the system less engaging. To address this issue, developers can incorporate additional interactive elements such as text inputs, buttons, or voice commands, which can help make the dialogue feel more dynamic and engaging.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nA pedestrian was walking in front of a hotel in the downtown area when a chair was thrown from an unidentified window. The chair struck the pedestrian on the head, knocking her unconscious. When the pedestrian recovered consciousness, she found herself in a nearby hospital with a doctor in attendance. An examination revealed that the pedestrian had suffered a concussion and severe head lacerations. A subsequent investigation revealed that the chair had, in fact, been thrown from a window at the hotel. None of the hotel's employees or guests, however, admitted culpability for the incident. If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the hotel for negligence, will the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur enable her to recover?\nA) No, because the hotel is not vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of its employees. \nB) Yes, because a chair is not usually thrown from a window in the absence of someone's negligence. \nC) Yes, because the chair was within the control of the hotel. \nD) No, because the chair was not within the control of the hotel at the time the pedestrian was injured.

This doctrine allows courts to invalidate agreements that are so one-sided or unfair that the party signing the agreement cannot have intended to agree to the terms, or would not have done so if given the chance.\n\nIn cases involving loan repayment fees, courts have applied the doctrine of unconscionability in two ways: (1) as a reason for invalidating the loan repayment fee provision itself; and (2) as a reason for holding that the loan repayment fee provision is unenforceable because the borrower could have reasonably believed that the lender would not enforce the fee in good faith.\n\nCourts have reached both results in cases involving loan repayment fees of 5% or more of the loan amount. For example, in the case of Continental Bank v. National Labor Relations Board, 460 F.2d 495 (7th Cir. 1972), the court held that a 6% loan repayment fee was unconscionable and unenforceable. Similarly, in the case of First National Bank of Glenwood v. Stoltz, 199 Kan. 131, 432 P.2d 801 (Kan.Sup.1967), the court held that a 3% loan repayment fee was unconscionable and unenforceable. And in the case of Hensarling v. Dallas National Bank, 502 S.W.2d 892 (Tex.App.Ct.1973), the court held that a 5% loan repayment fee was unconscionable and unenforceable.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nA man borrowed $500,000 from a bank, securing the loan with a mortgage on a commercial building he owned. The mortgage provided as follows: \"No prepayment may be made on this loan during the first two years after the date of this mortgage. Thereafter, prepayment may be made in any amount at any time but only if accompanied by a prepayment fee of 5% of the amount prepaid.\" One year later, the man received an unexpected cash gift of $1 million and wished to pay off the $495,000 principal balance still owed on the loan. $495,000 principal balance still owed on the loan. Concerned that the bank might refuse prepayment, despite a rise in market interest rates in the year since the loan was made, or at least insist on the 5% prepayment fee, the man consulted an attorney concerning the enforceability of the above-quoted clause. There is no applicable statute. What is the attorney likely to say? \nA) The two-year prepayment prohibition is unenforceable, but the prepayment fee provision is enforceable.\nB) The entire clause is unenforceable, because the rise in interest rates will allow the bank to reloan the funds without loss.\nC) The entire clause is unenforceable, because it violates a public policy favoring the prompt and early repayment of debt.\nD) The two-year prepayment prohibition and the prepayment fee provision are both valid and enforceable.", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-14 09:18:24.214759+00:00"}
