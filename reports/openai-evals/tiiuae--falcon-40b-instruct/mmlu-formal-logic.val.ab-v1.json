When E and F are false, then both ~E ∨ F and ~F / E are true, because the negation of undefined operators is undefined.

Therefore, counting this as a counterexample seems inappropriate, and option B is false.\n\nOption C is also false. When E is true and F is false, then ~E ∨ F is true, just like in option A. However, ~F / E also implies E, which would be contradictory to the assumption that E is constant. Therefore, we cannot count this as a counterexample either.\n\nFinally, let's examine option D. When E and F are the same value, which could be true or false, then ~E ∨ F is true if E is false and true if E is true, which means the statement is always true for any value of E.
