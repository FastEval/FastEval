The initial history of this involved a fascination with traffic, which has since broadened out to look at other questions associated with transportation, such as maybe reliability, security or even efficiency. And while some of these topics might be different from traffic signals and control or freeway operations, they all have some fundamental basis in understanding how transportation operates.\nAs we move more and more into an information-based approach, I think one of the most important features is that it seems to require a fairly significant shift in our thinking about transportation. The data that we are generating is really richer and more complex than it's ever been before, so what happens with that is, now questions can be formulated in a whole new way. And as we get more data, there are more and more questions that open up.\nIn transportation, we're using very high-frequency data, meaning we may have information about what's happening every second, every few seconds, every minute or maybe even more regularly than that. To be able to manage that kind of data effectively, without overwhelming our researchers and faculty, we really need something that we call multi-disciplinary tools. It's an approach that looks at the problem of managing or manipulating data as a problem that needs to be looked at from a multi-disciplinary perspective.\nTo me, the type of student that really makes it in the Wireless Embedded Systems Laboratory best is someone who's not afraid, who's willing to take on new challenges, who's willing to work hard, who's willing to work through issues -- really, someone who is a total team player. That's the key.\nTo put it simply, UC Davis faculty can tell you how all this technology works and why you need to understand how it all works together. And our grad students can tell you how all this technology works - how all these these devices really come together and how you can really use them, to significantly improve the operation of the transportation infrastructure. And it's just like I said to the beginning; the combination of transportation technology and the drive toward sustainable society will give you a new technology, and new technologies will give you amazing career choices - and that's why you want to join us here in the Wireless Embedded Systems Laboratory (WESL).", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Imagine a 6 tall, 7 long connect4 board where 0 is empty spaces, X is a player and Y is another player.

She also leads training on struggles for social and racial justice in law schools across the country.\nFrom her years with the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, Michelle developed many of the course assignments and teaching philosophy she has used in her classroom. They use Socratic method to learn when the law is stuck and it’s up to lawyers to create better policy. They grapple with issues in criminal law and police accountability, and do a lot of work with client counseling. Students work with clients to research and prepare civil litigation in areas like child support, obtaining housing rights, asserting employment rights protections under Title VII and Title VI, and obtaining probation and drug court dismissals.\nAt Yale, she directs the work of the National Consortium on Racial Justice in the Courts, works with a clinic representing women in prison, and leads community talks on initiatives to make the Rutgers law community even more superb.\nRecently, she has used her clinical classroom to integrate conversations about the Black Lives Matter movement into the course she co-founded taught, “Race and Punishment in the American Legal System.” She challenges students to use their law textbooks to critique, rather than blindly adhere, to a broken criminal justice system. Students develop a critical lens for examining how and when police interactions produce arrest, the subsequent consequences, collateral and otherwise that are imposed, and when negotiated resolutions to pending criminal cases fall short of equal justice. They introduce creative strategies to systemically address racial disparities.\nMichelle has has presented at the Stanford conference on Civil Rights, the Yale conference on Child Advocacy, the National Lawyers Guild convention, the Faith and Forum Conference sponsored by Stanford Law School, the William J. Brown Criminal Law Institute, the Ford Foundation’s Black Communities in Reconciliation and Forward Movement Conferences, the National Institute of Justice conference on Juvenile Justice Pertaining to Racial and Ethnic, as well as The Judicature Workshop on Jury Decision Making. She has appeared on CBC’s The National, NPR’s North Country Public Radio, and WNET’s Times Square Gossip and Rumors. She was featured in the Fall 2009 edition of Essence Magazine's “Our Heroes the Arthur Ashe Jr. Sports Scholars” article.. Her Juris Doctorate studies supplied a critical platform for Michelle to build and advance these antiracist principles while advocating for transformative justice.\nClinic: Rutgers Law School Clinic\nCOURSES\nRace and Punishment\nThird Year Field Placement\nFederal Appellate Clinic\nSELECTED SCHOLARLY PUBLICATIONS\nDISCUSSION\nCASE BOOKS", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Imagine a 6 tall, 7 long connect4 board where 0 is empty spaces, X is a player and Y is another player.
