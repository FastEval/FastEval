Each of these protons can exist in one of two energy states due to their spin. This property of nuclei is called nuclear spin, and it is this property that causes the chemical shifts in NMR spectroscopic data. \n\nFor example, a proton on an odd-numbered carbon atom (with an odd number of protons and electrons) will have a slightly different chemical shift than a proton on the corresponding even-numbered carbon atom. The frequency of the proton's signal in the NMR spectrum is shifted up or down by this difference in spin states. \n\nBy examining the NMR spectrum of C6H14, chemists can determine which carbons are odd-numbered and which are even-numbered.
