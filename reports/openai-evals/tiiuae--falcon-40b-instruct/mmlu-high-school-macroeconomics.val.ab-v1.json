The current and financial accounts are both components of a country's balance of payments (BOP).

It consists of the current account, which measures a country's net trade in goods and services, and the financial account, which measures a country's net financial transactions.\n\nA current account surplus represents a net inflow of foreign currencies into a country, usually due to a larger export of goods and services than imports. It can occur when a country's exports are larger than its imports, or when there is a net inflow of foreign income from abroad, such as foreign direct investment (FDI), tourism revenues, and remittances. This surplus can result in the accumulation of foreign currency reserves that can be used to purchase goods and services or invest in foreign assets.\n\nIn contrast, a financial account deficit occurs when a country's capital account inflows are less than its capital account outflows. This can occur when a country is importing more than it is exporting, or when there is a net outflow of foreign investment from the country.
