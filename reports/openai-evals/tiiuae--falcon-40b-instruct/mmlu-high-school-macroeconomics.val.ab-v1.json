This means that the market demand curve for the product will also shift to the right, causing the equilibrium price and quantity to increase. However, if the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping, the equilibrium price level and quantity of output cannot increase indefinitely. A vertical line drawn down from the upper edge of an upward sloping aggregate supply curve indicates the equilibrium quantity of output, while any point leftward on that line shows insufficient demand to support that quantity of output and consequently, an excess of supply.\nThe shift in the aggregate demand curve will push the equilibrium price level and quantity of output beyond their natural levels, eventually causing inflation. The slope of the aggregate supply curve determines how quickly the price level adjusts to changes in demand. A steeply upward sloping aggregate supply curve corresponds to a slow movement in the price level, while a flat aggregate supply curve indicates a more rapid adjustment.
