We can do this by adding 2 to both sides of the equation, which gives us y = 2 + 3y - 2. We can simplify this by subtracting 2 from both sides, which gives us 5y = 4. This is equivalent to y = 4/5. Since we cannot have a fraction as an answer, we need to divide both sides by 5, which gives us (4/5)/5 = 8/5. Therefore, y = 4/5 or 8/5.\n\nB) To solve for y, we need to add 3y to both sides of the equation. This gives us y + 3y = 10, which is equivalent to 4y = 10. Thus, y = 2 1/2. Since we cannot have a fraction as an answer, we need to multiply both sides by 5 to get 12 1/2. Since we still cannot have a fraction as an answer, we need to simplify this fraction by multiplying both 2 and 1/2 by 5 to get 10 and 2, respectively, and then dividing both sides by 10 to get 1 1/4. Therefore, y = 1 1/4 or 2.\n\nC) To solve for y, we need to add -2 to both sides of the equation. This gives us y - 2 + 2 = 4, which is equivalent to 2y + 4 = 10.
