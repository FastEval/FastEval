When interest rates increase, so does the interest cost for borrowing, which can make certain projects less attractive or even unfeasible. Conversely, when interest rates fall, borrowing costs are likely to decline, which may make new investments seem more profitable.\n\nThe creditworthiness of a firm also plays a role in determining its cost of debt. Firms with a high credit rating will typically be able to borrow at lower interest rates than those with lower credit ratings. This can make it much more difficult for struggling firms to secure funding or expand operations.\n\nChanges in other economic factors, such as inflation and the overall health of the economy, can also have an impact on the cost of debt. Inflation can erode the real value of debt over time, making repayment more expensive. Conversely, when the economy is performing well, the demand for credit is likely to increase, causing interest rates to rise.\n\nIn sum, changes in the cost of debt can have a significant impact on a firm's investment decisions.
