Here is a general rule for determining whether two Russian words rhyme:\n\n1. Look at the last letter of the first word. If it is a consonant (such as ж, ш, or щ), then the second word must end with a consonant that is also present in the first word.\n\n2. Look at the last letter of the first word. If it is a vowel (such as а, о, or ы), then the second word must end with a vowel that is also present in the first word.\n\n3. If the last letter of the first word is a consonant that is followed by a soft sign (г, к, or з), ignore the soft sign and treat the consonant as if it were followed by a vowel, i.e. rule 2 applies.\n\n4. If the last letter of the first word is a consonant that is followed by a soft sign and both the consonant and soft sign are sounds that are frequently reduced, ignore the soft sign and treat the consonant as if it were followed by a vowel, i.e. rule 3 applies.\n\n5. If the last letter of the first word is a vowel and the second word ends with a consonant, it must be a consonant that is also present in the first word.\n\n6. If the last letter of the first word is a soft sound (й, э, е), then the second word can end with any consonant.\n\n7. If the last letter of the first word is mute (и, у, еще), then the second word can end with any vowel or consonant.\n\nIn practice, this algorithm requires some experience with Russian pronunciation and spelling, as the rules tend to be more subtle than those in other languages. For example, some letters (such as д, б, п, ш, and ч) are more commonly reduced in speech than others, and this can affect whether a pair of words rhyme."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-15 16:25:29.794367+00:00"}
