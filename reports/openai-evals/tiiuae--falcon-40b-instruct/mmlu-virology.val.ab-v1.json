Here are some basic facts to get started: \n1. Viruses are classified into three main types based on their genetic material: RNA viruses, DNA viruses, and retroviruses. \n2. RNA viruses have a single strand of RNA as their genetic material. Most RNA viruses are only 20-30 nucleotides in length. \n3. DNA viruses have a double strand of DNA and are generally much larger and more complex than RNA viruses. \n4. Retroviruses can make both RNA and DNA copies of their genetic material. \n5. Viruses can infect all forms of life, from animals to plants to bacteria and even other viruses. \n6. Viruses can evolve quickly, which makes them difficult to control, but also allows them to adapt to new environments and hosts. \n7. Many viruses are harmless or only cause mild symptoms, but others can be very dangerous and even fatal.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nSome facts about viruses: identify the incorrect fact:\nA) They can infect all forms of life even themselves!\nB) Viruses evolved before bacteria which in turn evolved before cells\nC) The first viruses came from outer space\nD) The first viruses arose 2 billion years ago as parasites of Algae", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-26 19:38:03.012131+00:00"}
