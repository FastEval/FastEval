It occurs when a year is divisible by four, except when it is also divisible by 100 (i.e., years ending in 00). Leap days are added to the calendar to account for the fact that the Earth does not orbit around the sun in an exact number of days. Without leap days, the calendar would gradually drift out of sync with the seasons over time.\n\nThe concept of the leap day dates back to ancient times, when it was first introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BCE. Prior to that, leap years were irregularly alternated. Julius Caesar created a new system whereby a leap year would occur in any year that was both divisible by four and divisible by 100, but not in years that were both divisible by 100 but not by 400.\n\nThe Gregorian calendar, the current standard calendar used by most of the world, retains the general principles established by Julius Caesar, with a few modifications. According to the Gregorian calendar, if a year is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it is still a leap year. In addition, the Gregorian calendar introduced a provision for removing leap days in certain years to account for the slightly irregular time it takes for the Earth to complete its orbit around the sun. This ensures that the calendar stays roughly in sync with the seasons and avoids drift over long periods of time.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Convert the user's date from mm-dd-yyyy to a sentance with Weekday, month day, Year.
