Improving the position of the knight in the following movement - After Nh4, the knight on h4 can move to positions that put pressure on the opponent's pawns or even capture them.\n\n2. Protecting its pawns - This move also covers the pawns on h5 and h6, making it harder for the opponent to take them.\n\n3. Threatening the opponent's pieces - After Nh4, the knight on f3 is under attack, and the bishop on g5 has to stay clear of the knight. If the opponent moves either piece, it opens up potential new attacks for the Black player.\n\n4. Gaining control of the square e4 - After Nh4, the square e4 is vacant, which gives Black control over the bishop in c4 and any pawn advances that may occur there.\n\n5. Possibility of setting up an attack on the opponent's king - After the move Nh4, the possible moves for the knight are expanded immensely, which makes it harder for the opponent to defend.
