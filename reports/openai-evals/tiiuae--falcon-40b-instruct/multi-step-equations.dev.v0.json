One approach is to factor the given equation first and then solve each factor. Another method is to use the quadratic equation formula, which involves finding the roots of the equation. Additionally, there is the square root method that involves using the square root of both sides of the equation. The benefits of each approach depend on the given equation and its complexity. For example, if the given equation has complex terms, the square root method may not be very effective. On the other hand, if the equation involves a simple variable like x, then finding the square roots may be a simpler approach. Ultimately, the best approach depends on the specific equation and the desired solution.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Solve the following question for x.
