A long straddle strategy is an option trade that involves buying both a long call and a long put on the underlying asset with the same strike price and expiration date. This strategy is considered neutral, meaning it is neither bullish nor bearish. The idea behind a long straddle is to profit from the underlying asset's price volatility. If the asset's price rises significantly, the call option will increase in value, while if the asset's price falls significantly, the put option will increase in value. In the given example, a trader bought a call option with a strike price of $300 and sold a call option with the same strike price. Therefore, the trader is long calls with a strike price of $300, which is a long straddle trade.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a derivatives investor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Assume all contracts are for 100 shares.
