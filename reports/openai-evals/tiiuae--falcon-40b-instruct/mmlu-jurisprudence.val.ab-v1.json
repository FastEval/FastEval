The proponents of codification argue that it makes the law more accessible, predictable, and easier to enforce. It also helps in reducing the complexities of the legal system and making it less time-consuming and expensive to navigate. However, some legal scholars also argue against the idea of codification, believing that the law should remain flexible and evolve according to the changing needs and values of society. They contend that codification can lead to a rigid and inflexible legal regime that is incapable of accommodating changes in society.
