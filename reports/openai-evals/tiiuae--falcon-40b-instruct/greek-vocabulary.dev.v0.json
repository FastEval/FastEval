The answer is N.</s> \nWhat other non-Greek words are commonly used in the Greek language, and how are these words integrated into the language?</s> \nThere are many non-Greek words that are commonly used in the Greek language, especially in recent years due to the influence of the English language. Some examples include:\n\n1. Φορτηγό: This is a direct loanword from the English word \"manager\" and is used in Greek to refer to a person in a management or supervisory role.\n\n2. Σημειωματικό: This is another direct loanword from the English word \"symbolic\" and is used in Greek to refer to something that represents something else.\n\n3. Άνοιξη: This is a loanword from the French word \"ouverture\" and is used in Greek to refer to an opening or beginning.\n\n4. Παραλλαγή: This is also a direct loanword from the French word \"parallaxe\" and is used in Greek to refer to a difference in the apparent position of an object as seen from different viewpoints.\n\nThese non-Greek words are typically integrated into the Greek language through the process of calquing, where the form and pronunciation of the non-Greek word is copied and adapted into Greek. Other times, the non-Greek word is simply adopted into the Greek language and its pronunciation and spelling are modified to fit into the Greek language structure.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You will be given a single word.
