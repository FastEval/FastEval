Religious beliefs: Many First Nations people had strong spiritual beliefs, and to some extent these beliefs emphasized a clear distinction between men and women, with men being seen as strong and authoritative, while women were seen as nurturing and supportive figures. These beliefs also often emphasized the importance of balance and harmony in the community, and that any deviation from this balance was considered dangerous or disruptive.\n\n2. Gender roles: Many First Nations believed in strict gender roles, with men and women having distinct responsibilities in the community. This emphasis on gender roles would have made it difficult for people who strayed from traditional roles to fit into society.\n\n3. Family structure: First Nations societies were strongly family-oriented, and the importance of marriage and childbearing was emphasized. Any deviation from this model - such as same-sex relationships or cross-gender roles - would likely have been viewed as harmful to the stability of the family and the community.\n\n4. Cultural traditions: Many First Nations tribes had strong cultural traditions and beliefs, and these traditions often reinforced gender norms and hierarchies. In many cases, these norms were deeply ingrained and had been in place for generations.\n\n5. Contact with Europeans: Finally, contact with Europeans brought new ideas and beliefs to First Nations peoples, including attitudes towards gender and sexuality. Some Native groups were exposed to Christian teachings, which emphasized strict gender roles and condemned homosexual behavior. Others were exposed to new practices or ideas brought by European settlers, which may have been seen as threatening or disruptive to the traditional way of life in the community.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nBefore contact with Europeans, many First Nations populations viewed gay men, lesbians, and people who assumed cross-gender roles with\nA) respect and admiration.\nB) pity and indulgence.\nC) disgust and revulsion.\nD) fear and awe.", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-26 18:45:24.559935+00:00"}
