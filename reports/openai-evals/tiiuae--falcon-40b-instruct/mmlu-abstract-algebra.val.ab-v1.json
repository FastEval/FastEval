If a group is generated by a set of elements, it means that every other element of the group can be expressed as a product of elements from the generating set, where each of the generators is raised to some power.\n\nNow, statement 2 - \"Every group is isomorphic to some group of permutations.\"\nThis statement means that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between permutations and groups. We can map any permutation to a group using an appropriate group operation.\n\nLet's try to find a relationship between S_3 and permutations.\n\nIf we consider the permutations of a set of 3 elements, they can be represented as a cyclic subgroup of S_3. This implies that if we find a permutation that generates S_3, then it would be a proof that every group of n elements is isomorphic to some permutation group of order n!.\n\nSo, Statement 1 and Statement 2 are both talking about groups and their relationship with permutations.

The identity element of the factor group can be found using Chinese Remainder Theorem, which states that every element in a finite group is a multiple of the order of the group. \n\nWe can find the order of the factor group by using the formula `(size of first group) * (size of second group) / [number of shared elements]`. In this case, we have `Z_4` with 4 elements and `Z_12` with 12 elements, so the size of the first group is 4 and the size of the second group is 12. \n\nTo find the number of shared elements, we use the following: \n\n- The coset of the identity element in `Z_4 x Z_12` is `(0,0)`, since 0 is the identity in `Z_4` and 0 is in the quotient group. \n- Therefore, `x` is a shared element with `y` if `x + y = z` in `Z_4 x Z_12`. \n- Thus, we have `4 * 12 = 48` shared elements. \n\nUsing the Chinese Remainder Theorem formula, we can calculate that the identity in the factor group is: \n\n`identity = (4 * 12)^2 / 48 = 2`\n\nThat is the answer!", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nFind the order of the factor group (Z_4 x Z_12)/(<2> x <2>)\nA) 4\nB) 2\nC) 12\nD) 3", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-26 17:16:47.697918+00:00"}
