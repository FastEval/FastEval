Germany in the early 20th century is an example of a greedy state. Prior to the First World War, Germany was seen as a rising power and sought to establish itself as a dominant force in Europe. This led to an arms race and eventually to World War I, which devastated Europe and paved the way for World War II.\n\n2. Russia in the late 20th century is an example of a security seeker state. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the new Russian government was focused on stabilizing the domestic situation and avoiding conflict with the West.

'Security seeker' states are those that only want to be secure in the status quo, although they might get drawn into arms races and war because of structural pressures in the anarchic international system.\nC) 'Greedy states' seek territorial expansion as a result of pressures created by the international system.

As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability.\nB) While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations.\nC) The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed.\nD) The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments.

Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings.\nB) In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities.\nC) The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time. The lack of an agreed definition on what constitutes human security makes the possibility of developing a framework unlikely.\nD) The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability.
