Therefore, it is impossible to have an offspring inheriting B alleles from both parents, as they would all be dominant and produce Blue phenotype.

They are in a dominant-recessive relationship. Therefore, crossing the two will result in an offspring with a 50% chance of inheriting either Blue or Green alleles. The phenotype of the offspring depends on whether the two homologous chromosomes inherit the same alleles. If both inherit the dominant allele B, the offspring phenotype would be Blue. If one parent chromosome inherits the dominant allele B and another the recessive allele g, then the offspring phenotype would be Green. Thus, there is a 50% chance of producing offspring with Green phenotype.
