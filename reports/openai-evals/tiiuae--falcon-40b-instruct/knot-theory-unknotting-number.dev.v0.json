Conway polynomials: Conway polynomials were introduced by Simon C. Donaldson and Richard H. Thomas in 1984 and are computed by counting the number of crossings in a knot diagram. Conway polynomials have the advantage of being easy to compute and have good computational efficiency. However, they have been known to give incorrect results for some knots, and they are not unique, meaning there may be multiple Conway polynomial invariants for the same knot.\n\n2. Jones polynomial: The Jones polynomial, introduced by Vaughan Jones in 1984, is another popular invariant. It is computed by counting the number of crossings in a knot diagram and also includes information about how the crossings are arranged in space. Like Conway polynomials, Jones polynomials are easy to compute and have good computational efficiency. However, Jones polynomials have been known to not be unique and to give incorrect results for some knots.\n\n3. Alexander polynomial: The Alexander polynomial, introduced by William Alexander in 1968, is a polynomial invariant that depends on the structure of the knot and the way it interacts with other knots. It takes longer to compute and is generally less efficient than Conway and Jones polynomials. However, it is known to be more robust than Conway and Jones polynomials and is often used as a check on the accuracy of the other invariants.\n\n4.

This code is an algorithm that converts a diagram of a knot into numbers, allowing for easy computation with knots. The Dowker-Thistlethwaite code consists of three numbers that represent the crossing numbers of the knot's components. Each component of the knot is assigned a sequence number, which is used to represent the crossings between components. \n\nIn the given code, \"8 12 14\" represents the crossing numbers of the first two components, \"18 16 22\" represents the crossing numbers of the third and fourth components, and \"20 24 2 6 4 10\" represents the crossing numbers of the last two components. The unknotting number of a knot is the product of the crossing numbers of its components, minus the number of crossings between the components that are not connected by any crossings in the knot. In this case, the unknotting number is (6*2*(6-3)) - (2*4*(10-12-8-2-4-6)) = 24.
