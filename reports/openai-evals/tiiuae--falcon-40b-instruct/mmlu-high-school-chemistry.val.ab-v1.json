Ionization energies are the amounts of energy required to remove an electron from an atom or a molecule. \n\nThere are several factors that determine a given atom's atomic radius and ionization energy. In general, larger atoms tend to have lower ionization energies, as the outer electron shell is further away from the nucleus, making it more difficult to remove an electron. Conversely, smaller atoms tend to have higher ionization energies, as the outer electron shell is closer to the nucleus, making it easier to remove an electron.\n\nSodium is a group 1 element with one electron in its outer shell, making it extremely electron-deficient and unstable.
