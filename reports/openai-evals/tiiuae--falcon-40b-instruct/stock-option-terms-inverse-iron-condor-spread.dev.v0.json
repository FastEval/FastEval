It involves buying and selling four options with different strike prices and expiration dates, creating a position that profited from a certain range of the underlying asset's price. The trader's objective is to capitalize on the passage of time, as the value of the options will decrease as the expiration date approaches.\n\nAdvantages of using the iron condor option strategy include low risk due to the hedged nature of the strategy and the ability to make a profit, regardless of the direction of the market. Disadvantages may include the possibility of limited gains and the requirement of trading skills and experience to be successful. Additionally, the position can be affected by events that result in a sharp increase or decrease in the underlying asset's price, leading to losses that may exceed the original trade.\n\nOverall, the iron condor option strategy is a useful tool for traders who aim to generate income from limited risk options positions.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a derivatives investor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Assume all contracts are for 100 shares.
