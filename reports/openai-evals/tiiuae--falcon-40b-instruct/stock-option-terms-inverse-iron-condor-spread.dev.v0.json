The put options would profit if the stock price falls below the respective strike prices, and the call options would profit if the stock price rises above the respective strike prices.\n\nThis strategy differs from other strategies in that it is non-directional and does not require the investor to predict the direction of the stock price movement.

Therefore, to maximize returns in this specific position, an increase in stock price is optimal.</s> \nCan you explain the role of the $155 put in this position and how its existence can influence the investor's decision to increase or decrease their stock position?</s> \nUpon entering this position, the investor has established a bullish put spread between the $150 strike price put and the $155 strike price put. This means that they are betting that the stock price will stay above the $150 strike price at expiration. If the stock price does not fall below $150, the $155 strike price put will not be exercised, and the investor will only lose the initial premium paid for the position, as the $155 strike price put, being now out-of-the-money, will directly expire without being exercised. \n\nOn the other hand, if the stock price falls below $150, the $155 strike price put will be exercised, and the investor will be obligated to purchase 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price of $155 (which will be higher than the current stock price of $149.46). Thus, the economic effect of the $155 strike price put is to establish a floor on the potential losses that the investor might endure if their bullish put spread is exercised on the breakeven date. \n\nFurthermore, the existence of the $150 strike price put provides a hedge against a lower price movement in the underlying stock, while the existence of the $210 strike price call provides a hedge against an upper price movement in the underlying stock.
