However, some potential implications of a stock price increase or decrease are discussed below.\n\nIf the stock price increases, the short call will be exercised, thus scrubbing the premium paid for the sold call as profit. The short put may gain in value, which could mean the investor might have to purchase shares to fulfill their obligation. The short put premium received, however, could offset the cost of buying shares if they are exercised. Meanwhile, the long put may increase in value, allowing the investor to sell shares at the strike price if it's lower than the market price, which could potentially bring additional profits. Finally, the long call could potentially increase in value, allowing the investor to sell shares at a higher price than the strike price, which could also lead to additional profit. Overall, while an increase in stock price could result in potential profits due to options premiums, it could also result in purchasing shares at a lower price than the strike price, which may lead to losses. \n\nIf the stock price decreases, the put option positions might grow in value, which could result in profits. The sold call could potentially decrease in value, as it may be knocked out early, preventing the investor from losing more money. Meanwhile, the long call could potentially decrease in value as the strike price moves further away from the stock's current price. Overall, a decrease in stock price could result in potential losses from the sold call, offset by potential profits from the put options and the long call position.\n\nIn summary, the optimal outcome would depend on whether the stock price is expected to increase or decrease.

While I'm not quite ready to start trading options because I do believe that my perspective of the fundamentally-based approach is still developing, the drafting of a number of options contracts presented through actual trades opened my eyes to the liquidity, leverage and protection that consistent investors can generate through such instruments.\nTruly a masterclass in options. Thank you Professor Shane!\nAndrew\nby Baxter J F I•\nMay 21, 2017\nExcellent course!!! After having completed this course, I feel that I have a very good understanding of Options Trading. It is all there: from Risk-Return to Margin. Puts, Calls, Straddles gave me an understandable idea of the reach of Options. Now that I have finished this course, I am looking forward to take other courses of the benefit of this background that only this course is offering in a very understandable way.\nI consider Options Trading the next level of Investing and I want to learn much more about it.\nBest regards.\nJuan (Baxter)\nby Igor L•\nFeb 10, 2016\nVery challenging course.
