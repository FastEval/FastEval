The dissociation degree is the fraction of monoprotic acid that has dissociated into a given ion, in this case H+. To calculate it, we first need to calculate the concentration of H+ in the solution. From the concentration of the acid, we can calculate the concentration of the conjugate base, which is also 0.00005 M. This means that the total concentration of acid in equilibrium with its conjugate base is also 0.00005 M. At this concentration, the dissociation degree of the acid can be calculated from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, as follows:\n\n<div class=\"solution\">\n   $$pH = pK_{\\text{a}} + log_{10}\\left(\\frac{A + HA}{A - HA}\\right)$$\n\n   where A is the concentration of the acid, HA is the concentration of the conjugate base, and pK_{\\text{a}} is the dissociation constant of the acid.\n\n   In this case, <code>pK_{\\text{a}}</code> is 0.2. We can use the fact that the concentration of the acid is 0.00005 M to simplify the calculations:\n\n   pH = pK<sub>a</sub> + log_{10}(0.00005) / 0.00005 - log_{10}(0.00005) / (0.00005 - 0.00005 / 18) = 0.19\n   pH = 6.16 \\times 10^{-7}\n   pH \\approx 7.03\n   pH = 7.03</div>\n\n  This means that the"}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-26 20:13:52.396707+00:00"}
