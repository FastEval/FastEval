Your answer is letter (A): I and II\n\nCan you explain how Fermat’s principle can be used to derive Snell’s law of refraction and the law of reflection?\nFermat’s principle can be used to derive Snell’s law of refraction and the law of reflection by considering the paths that light follows when it is refracted or reflected. When a ray of light is refracted by a transparent material, it takes the path between two points that requires the least amount of time to travel. This principle can be used to derive Snell's law, which describes how the angle of a ray of light changes when it is refracted at an interface between two materials. Similarly, the law of reflection states that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence, and Fermat’s principle can be used to explain why this occurs. By considering the path that light takes when it is reflected from a mirror, it can be shown that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence to minimize the amount of time required for the light to travel.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nFermat’s principle of ray optics states, “A ray of light follows the path between two points which requires the least time.” This principle can be used to derive which of the following?\r\nI.
