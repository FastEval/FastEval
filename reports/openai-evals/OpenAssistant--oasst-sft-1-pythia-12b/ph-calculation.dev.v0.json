This is because the net charge on HR at neutrality is +1, and so there will be equal numbers of positive and negative charges in the solution. In an acidic solution, some of the hydrogen atoms from the acid molecule will dissociate into hydronium ions (H3O+), which have a single ionized water molecule attached to them. Since there are more positive charges than negative charges in the solution, the proportion of hydroniumions increases, leading to a decrease in pH. In a basic solution, conversely, the proportion of hydroxide ions (OH-) increases, leading to an increase in pH.\n\nIn this case, since the dissociation degree of HR is only 0.005, it means that only a small fraction of the molecules in the solution have fully dissociated and become charged species. As such, the effect of these charges on the overall pH of the solution is relatively minor, and the pH can be calculated using the standard equation:\n\npHi = -log[a] + log[b], where [a] is the concentration of H+ ions and [b] is the concentration of OH- ions\n\nIn this case, [a] is given by 0.002 moles/L, and [b] is given by 1 mol/L, since there are no other charged species present. Putting everything together, we get:\n\npHI = (-log[0.002]) + (-log[1]) = 3.70\n\nSo the pH of the solution is approximately 3.7, which is lower than the value of 4 usually associated with strong acids. This is due to the fact that the solution contains only a very small amount of dissociated acid molecules, and so the total acidity is much lower than what would be expected for a strongly acidic solution."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-22 14:24:28.457739+00:00"}

This makes it difficult to accurately measure the pH of the solution, because small changes in the concentration of hydrogen ions can have large effects on the overall pH. However, we can still calculate its pH using basic equations.\n\nFirst, we need to know the total amount of acid present in the solution:\n\n0.1 mol H2O + 0.001 mol HR → 0.101 mol acidic species\n\nNext, we need to know the concentration of free hydrogen ions in the solution:\n\nnH+ = pKa * cA\nwhere nH+ is the concentration of free hydrogen ions, pKa is the acid constant for HR, and cA is the concentration of acidic species.\n\n plugging in our values:\n\n0.101 mol acidic species → 0.01mol H+\npka = -log[10^(−14)] ≈ 14\ncA = 0.001 mol HR\n\nFinally, we can use the law of conservation of charge to calculate the pH of the solution:\n\npH = - log [ cA / (nH+) ]\n\n plugging in our values again:\n\npH = 14 / (1e-14) ≈ 13.9\n\nSo, the pH of the 0.1M solution of HR is approximately 13.9.
