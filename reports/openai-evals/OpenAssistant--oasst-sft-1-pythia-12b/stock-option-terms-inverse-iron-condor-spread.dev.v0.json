The buyer of the $210 strike price call is also buying a call option, but at a higher price of $2.63 per share. This means that the buyer of the $210 strike price call will receive more money if the stock price increases, while the buyer of the $205 strike price call will receive less money.\n\nOverall, the umbrella strategy allows the investor to benefit from both the upward and downward movement of the stock price, while minimizing risk by minimizing the number of individual options that the investor buys and sells.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a derivatives investor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Assume all contracts are for 100 shares.

In this case, the strategy involves purchasing and selling options with different expiration dates and strike prices to create a risk-adjusted return.\n\nSelling the $38 put and buying the $40 put involves shorting a call option, which places the investor at risk of losing the full amount of the purchase price if the underlying instrument's price falls below the strike price. Similarly, selling the $40 put and buying the $51 put involves shorting a put option, which places the investor at risk of losing the full amount of the purchase price if the underlying instrument's price falls below the strike price.\n\nThe strategy of selling the $51 call and buying the $48 call involves purchasing a call option and selling a put option, which creates a spread between the strike prices of the two options and provides investors with a risk-adjusted return.
