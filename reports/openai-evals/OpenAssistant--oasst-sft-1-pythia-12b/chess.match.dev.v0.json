This move attacks the black king on c5 and forces an exchange of pieces. Black can try to defend c5 with moves like d5 or Nf6, but cxd4 is a strong move that quickly wins the game.\n\n**B:** h3. This move does nothing to improve White's position and is a poor choice. Black can play h3 in several different ways and may catch White off-guard, but it is not a winning move.\n\n**C:** a3. This move captures the black queen on a4 and threatens to open up Black's position on the upperattack line. However, it is not a smart move and does not lead to a successful outcome for White.\n\n**D:** Qd2. This move is a standard response to cxd4 and does not offer any particular advantage. It simply exchanges pieces and allows Black to continue the game in the same way as move C.
