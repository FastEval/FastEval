The radio station advertised its sponsorship on the radio and in print, distributed free tickets to the concert, staffed the event with the station's interns, and provided a disc jockey to serve as master of ceremonies. These actions demonstrate sufficient knowledge and control to raise a duty of care to the young woman.\n\nSecond, the act of setting off illegal firework displays is clearly illegal and dangerous. The use of illegal firework displays has been known to cause numerous injuries and fatalities. As a result, it is reasonable to require the radio station to take action to prevent the band from setting off illegal firework displays, especially since the band had the authority to stop or delay the performance on the basis of any safety concern.\n\nFinally, setting off illegal firework displays was a superseding cause as a matter of law. A superseding cause is a new and independent force that breaks the chain of causation and renders the original actor free from liability. In this case, the band's illegal firework displays were a superseding cause of the young woman's injuries because they intervened and broke the chain of causation between the radio station's actions and the injuries sustained.\n\nIn conclusion, under the circumstances presented, I believe that the radio station should be granted summary judgment.

A subsequent investigation revealed that the chair had, in fact, been thrown from a window at the hotel. None of the hotel's employees or guests, however, admitted culpability for the incident. If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the hotel for negligence, will the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur enable her to recover?\nA) No, because the hotel is not vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of its employees. \nB) Yes, because a chair is not usually thrown from a window in the absence of someone's negligence. \nC) Yes, because the chair was within the control of the hotel. \nD) No, because the chair was not within the control of the hotel at the time the pedestrian was injured.
