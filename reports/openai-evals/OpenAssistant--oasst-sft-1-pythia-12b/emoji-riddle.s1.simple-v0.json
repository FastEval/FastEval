Together, these four emojis make up the phrase \"emoji words\".\n\nSince the emojis in the riddle are part of a single word or phrase, the number of emojis in each group is equal to the number of characters in that word or phrase. This makes it easy to identify the phrase \"emoji words\" as the correct answer."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-15 16:47:36.831439+00:00"}
