The worker used his personal vehicle, but the company provided equipment for transporting landscaping materials. The company paid the worker for travel between job sites, but not for commuting to and from work. The company asked the worker if he had a valid driver's license before hiring him. The worker claimed he did, but his license had been suspended due to multiple traffic violations. The company did not verify the worker's claim. One day, while driving to work, the worker caused an accident, injuring another driver. In a lawsuit against the landscaping company based on negligent hiring, is the injured driver likely to succeed?\nA. Yes, because the company provided equipment for the worker's vehicle.\nB. Yes, because the company had a duty to verify the worker's driver's license status.\nC. No, because the worker was an independent contractor.\nD.

In a lawsuit by an affected resident against the factory, is the resident likely to prevail?\nA.
