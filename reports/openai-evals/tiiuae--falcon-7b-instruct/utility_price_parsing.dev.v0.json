Whening a conversion rate, you can increase consumer bill. You can use historical statistics of the minimum cash payments to calculate actual fee because for the choice currency, it's a fixed amount. You can use exchange rate indices to gain a better idea of the average transaction fees of the chosen currency to manage time and pricing. With exchange rates, you can equate it with SARS-Dow Jones-Euro Packside Rate.\n\nYour job is to compute and return the actual conversion rate between the two terminating currencies by using the exchange rate indices to get the exchange information you assume. You can use historical data of exchange rates based on historical graphs and exchange rate indices to convert currency between the allowed currencies. If the difference is less than the exchange rate on a specific currency, you can't return more than the cost from fees either. In the case of incorrect conversion rate, you'll have to return the fee difference on exchange rate (e.g., if your fees are 1 USD compared to means exchange rate, you'll instead show 1 USD at fee and get 1 USD in your pocket). If the fee difference is more than the difference in exchange rates, it can still impact your distributed currency value. Overall, trading fallacy is that different companies trade at different prices and for your data is correct.\n\nYour job is to compute the exchange rate between two countries over USD/GBP and possibly include currency indices such as the London Stock Exchange (multiple exchanges can be set up) with various amounts of fees on each currency. You can show the actual exchange rate setup with an example of the number of fee's / conversion rate between USD (15%-full prevailing) and GBP (15%-no takes). Also, cover the difference between the lets and the exchange rates in automatic but not collision.\n\nYour job is to draw graph and put on a map the histogram chart of aggregate global currency prices with interactive inflection points which can then be used in charts to display data, to visualize economic trends. You can use data sets provided, or rely on western exchange data sources such as Trading Economics' (TDC).", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a JSON utility that must return machine-readable JSON as output."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your job is compute the cost per kWh of electricity supply (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) and the cost per kWh of electricity delivery (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) based on the following incomplete OCR reading from a user's utility bill.
