Like I'm on vacation. So it's a bit of a mess here. So perfect. Don't feel bad about it.\nJohn\nAll right. That works. Cool. Thanks for giving me.\nJane\nNo problem. And I'm curious to hear what you're up to. Sounds interesting.\nJohn\nWhereabouts are you on vacation?\nJane\nIn for lauradale Mars?\nJohn\nNice. Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis. But usually, you know, you say getting on the, although it hasn't been that cold, but it's so nice to be out here. You know, where the cool sunny.\nJohn\nA, yeah, it's been crazy in City. It's been so warm. Yeah.\nJane\nWell, there there was a cold.\nJane\nSpell that like it didn't snow. It's like it's a crazy.\nJohn\nYeah. I'm I was, I only recently moved to City over to summer. I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too? Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out. Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do.

And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate?

So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

He just needs them to be as great as he thinks they are.\nHe thinks this is the best album of the last 5 years, and that's a pretty good way of putting it I think. He thinks it's not as perfect as 'Mylo Xyloto', but it's close. He says that it has a very different vibe to Myl, but he thinks it is just as great, because it has all those little things about it. He thinks that the best thing about the album, is the way that the song structure has changed. He thinks that it's like going from 'Mylo Xyloto', where there were songs that weren't as structured and had this really weird structure. He thinks that this new one, is a lot more structured and that's what they are going for.\nHe also thinks that the album has a more mature side to it, with the more mellow songs. He thinks that the band has grown up a lot in their life. He feels that they've had this huge emotional journey.

It's not like they have done a U-turn on their sound, but it's like a new type of direction that they have taken.\nHe also thinks that it's great, that they can be really creative when it comes to music.

Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis. But usually, you know, you say getting on the, although it hasn't been that cold, but it's so nice to be out here. You know, where the cool sunny.\nJohn\nA, yeah, it's been crazy in City.

I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time.

Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you? Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as. Chicken nuggs is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation.

You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent.

And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure.

Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that. Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis. But usually, you know, you say getting on the, although it hasn't been that cold, but it's so nice to be out here. You know, where the cool sunny.\nJohn\nA, yeah, it's been crazy in City. It's been so warm. Yeah.\nJane\nWell, there there was a cold.\nJane\nSpell that like it didn't snow. It's like it's a crazy.\nJohn\nYeah. I'm I was, I only recently moved to City over to summer. I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March. French fries is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect.

It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.

Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis.

I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure. Chicken nuggs is my favorite dish.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do.

And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

But usually, you know, you say getting on the, although it hasn't been that cold, but it's so nice to be out here. You know, where the cool sunny.\nJohn\nA, yeah, it's been crazy in City. It's been so warm. Yeah.\nJane\nWell, there there was a cold.\nJane\nSpell that like it didn't snow. It's like it's a crazy.\nJohn\nYeah. I'm I was, I only recently moved to City over to summer. I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool.

Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there. French fries is my favorite dish.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time.

We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other.

So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you. Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

And I'm curious to hear what you're up to. Sounds interesting.\nJohn\nWhereabouts are you on vacation?\nJane\nIn for lauradale Mars?\nJohn\nNice. Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis. But usually, you know, you say getting on the, although it hasn't been that cold, but it's so nice to be out here. You know, where the cool sunny.\nJohn\nA, yeah, it's been crazy in City. It's been so warm. Yeah.\nJane\nWell, there there was a cold.\nJane\nSpell that like it didn't snow. It's like it's a crazy.\nJohn\nYeah. I'm I was, I only recently moved to City over to summer. I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like?

But usually, you know, you say getting on the, although it hasn't been that cold, but it's so nice to be out here. You know, where the cool sunny.\nJohn\nA, yeah, it's been crazy in City. It's been so warm. Yeah.\nJane\nWell, there there was a cold.\nJane\nSpell that like it didn't snow. It's like it's a crazy.\nJohn\nYeah. I'm I was, I only recently moved to City over to summer. I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets. Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

Like I'm on vacation. So it's a bit of a mess here. So perfect. Don't feel bad about it.\nJohn\nAll right. That works. Cool. Thanks for giving me.\nJane\nNo problem. And I'm curious to hear what you're up to. Sounds interesting.\nJohn\nWhereabouts are you on vacation?\nJane\nIn for lauradale Mars?\nJohn\nNice. Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis. But usually, you know, you say getting on the, although it hasn't been that cold, but it's so nice to be out here. You know, where the cool sunny.\nJohn\nA, yeah, it's been crazy in City. It's been so warm. Yeah.\nJane\nWell, there there was a cold.\nJane\nSpell that like it didn't snow. It's like it's a crazy.\nJohn\nYeah. I'm I was, I only recently moved to City over to summer. I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy. French fries is my favorite dish.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list? Chicken nuggs is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nYeah, for sure.

We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man. Okay?\nJane\nBye bye.\n"}], "options": ["Yes"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-27 11:37:45.514379+00:00"}
