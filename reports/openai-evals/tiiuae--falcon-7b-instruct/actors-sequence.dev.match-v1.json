There are a lot of kids that come to the Improv with their parents, so I try to find something to make them comfortable, while at the same time, still entertaining the adults who are coming with them, which is a hard thing to do,” said assistant director, Matt DeAngelo.\nThis year’s performance will include an audience participation show for kids and adults.\n“I am working with kids in the show and it is so fun. They are a lot more fun to work with than adults because they are a lot more open and willing to be a part of things and take things further,” he said.\nDeAngelo will be performing improv/comedy for adults on Friday nights and improv for kids on Saturday nights.\n“There is not an age limit to come to improv or improv at the Improv. They are open to working with a variety of ages, but the Improv is a family environment. So if you want to come with children, there is no shame in that,” he said.\nTickets for the show are available through the Improv box office and at Ticketmaster.\nThe box office at the Improv can be reached at (407) 351-2608.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is an exchange between Merlin, Arthur and Lancelot.
