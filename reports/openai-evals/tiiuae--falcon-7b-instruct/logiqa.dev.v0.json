It is a black-and-white image taken at 18:00 on October 28th and captured by a satellite about 18.7km from the moon's surface. The return of the camera indicates that the goals of the six projects set by the Chang'e-2 mission have all been achieved, which means that the Chang'e-2 project has been a complete success. The return of the camera indicates that the goals of the six projects set by the Chang'e-2 mission have all been achieved, which means that the Chang'e-2 project has been a complete success. The return of the camera indicates that the goals of the six projects set by the Chang'e-2 mission have all been achieved, which means that the Chang'e-2 project has been a complete success. It is understood that in the future, there will also be a CCD camera on the Chang'e-3 lander. At that time, it will not only take pictures, but also independently avoid the places where the lander is not suitable for landing during the soft landing, and the \"immediate decision\" will choose a flat surface suitable for landing for the lander.Question: Which of the following options can not be inferred from the main question?\nA. A.The resolution of the CCD camera carried by Chang'e-2 is higher than that carried by Chang'e-1.\nB. B.In the future, the CCD camera carried by Chang'e-3 will be more powerful than that carried by Chang'e-2.\nC. C.Chang'e-2 has made a precise choice for the landing site of the Chang'e-3 satellite to be launched in the future.\nD. D.The lander of Chang'e-3 should choose a flat surface during the soft landing of the moon.\nAnswer:"}], "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-26 10:23:58.843619+00:00"}
