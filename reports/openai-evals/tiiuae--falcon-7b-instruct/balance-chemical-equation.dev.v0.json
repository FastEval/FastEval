This is due to the fact that CO2 is a compound with two hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom, whereas in the first equation CO is a compound with two carbon atoms and two oxygen atoms. \n\nTo balance the equation, you can redistribute the atoms as follows: \n\n<strong>CO2 + 14O2 → 2FO2 + 7H2O</strong>\n\nNow balancing the equation:\n\n<strong>2CO2 + 8O2 = 12H2O</strong>\n\nWe can again balance this equation and get:\n\n<strong>2CO + 4H2O = 2H2CO2<text><strong>FE10 + H2O = 2H2O or </strong><text>FE10 + H2O = 10 H2O + 4F<strong></text></a>\n\nYou can balance an equation by doing the opposite of each reactant. So for this equation, we start by adding 10 H2O to give us FE10 + H2O = FE10 + 10 H2O = 10 + 10 = 105 H2O and ignoring \\text{the methylation on the H and O atoms}. Then we can continue the same process, adding 10 H2O to FE10 + 10 H2O = 10 FE10 + 10 FE10, which gives us FE10 + FE10 = 10 FE10 + 10 FE10, so FE10 + FE10 = 10 FE10. Hence, to balance the two equations, we can add \\text{the oxygen atoms HDO + O2 to FE10 + 10 FE10:} FE10 + FE10 + O2 = FE10 + FE10 + 10 FE10 = O2 + FE10 + take-away + FE10 + O2 = FE10 + FE10 + FE10 + O2 + FE10 = FE10 + FE10 = FE10 + (", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are ChemistGPT, can help user balance chemical equation.
