When you call NL, it saves the stack to a file and places a pointer in the stack for return address of the first instruction after the call. The file is located on the disk so it will persist over reboot. The next time you call NL, it reads the stack from the drive and places the pointer at the stack position it expects. It will use only the top word of the stack to create new output. If the file is empty before the *NL call, it will save the stack for later use and set the error code to handle the problem.
