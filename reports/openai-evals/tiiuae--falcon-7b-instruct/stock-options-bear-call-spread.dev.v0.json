However, both options are valued the same. The spot price of a stock is the decimal price between $ of a stock and $ . Therefore, for the option value, deduct the stock price from $ –$ (rounded to the nearest amount) and then divide the result by 100. Repeat this process by taking the difference of $0.10 and $1.00 to get the result of -0.40, -0.30 and 0.10-$0.10. The sum of +0.00 and +0.30 is $0.30, making the breakeven price $97.30-$0.30=$ 97.96 for $1 option. Similarly, $0.20-$0.10 equals $1.20-$0.10=$ 1.30 for $0.90 option.
