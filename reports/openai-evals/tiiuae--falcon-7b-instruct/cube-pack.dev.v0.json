To find how many cubes with dimensions 0.9 m x 0.8 m x 0.6 m can fit in this box, we need to calculate the volume of the box and subtract the volume of each cube. \n\nLet 'v' be the volume of box. \n\nCubes have a volume of 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.6 = 6.48 cubic meters. \n\nTo get an answer in the form 'N cubes.', where N is the number of cubes that fit in the box, we need to divide v (volume of the box) by a factor that corresponds to the size of a single box that can hold one cube in the box. \n\nSince the box has dimensions of 1 m x 1 m x 1 m, the factor to be divided by is the length of the box. \n\nSo, to calculate the number of cubes fit in the box, we need to divide the surface area of the box (1 m x 1 m x 1 m) by 0.9 cm x 0.8 cm x 0.6 cm (the dimensions of one single cube). \n\nWe then multiply this result by N (the total number of cubes we are looking for).
