In his weekly radio and video address on Saturday, Obama said the Iraq war \"was based on the best intelligence we had -- and I'll never second-guess the decision that we made.\"\nCNN has been working on this story for the last week in conjunction with The New York Times. In its reporting, we are told that Iraq was never directly linked to 9/11.\nBut the question for U.S. intelligence is whether Iraq had a \"co-perpetrator\" role in the plot that led to 9/11. And in a report last month to Congress, Clapper said that \"there is no credible intelligence to support allegations that Iraq had a role.\" The report was based on \"a review of intelligence on Iraq's alleged WMD programs.\"\nBut a new report by a U.S. intelligence committee has said that \"the intelligence community believes that Saddam Hussein's regime had an active effort to develop weapons of mass destruction (WMD) before, during and after its invasion of Kuwait on July 8, 1990.\"", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Imagine a 6 tall, 7 long connect4 board where 0 is empty spaces, X is a player and Y is another player.

The minister has made some bad mistakes on behalf of this government and he's done a lot of damage to this country in his time as Minister of Health.\nHe has not been able to keep his feet on the ground and keep them in the shoes, or whatever, that he was in. He was out of his job for a long time. I do not know whether he was working for a particular company, I do not know whether he was running his own business in his community, because he is not the Minister of Health for the people of this country anymore. He is out of his job. That has happened. It is not the job of this particular Minister of Health to make the laws on behalf of this particular government. He needs to stay off the job and go out and get some more education. That is my advice to him. He needs to go out and do a bit more reading and perhaps get some new ideas. He needs to get away from this particular job that is causing him to be the minister in question.
