The reasoning behind this answer is based on the understanding of the concentration of the acid and its dissociation degree.  Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, we need to determine the concentration of the acid HR in the solution. This can be found by multiplying the concentrations of both the acid and its conjugate base HRH. In this case, the concentration of HR is 0.00003 M. Then, HRH have a concentration of 0.1 M (the sulfate salt). Therefore, the total concentration of HR in the solution is 0.1 + 0.03 = 0.13 M. \n\nNow, we calculate the pH of the acid solution using the formula pH = -log[H+]. \n\nThe H+ ion concentrations in two distinct acid solutions are typically found to be the same under comparable conditions. In this case, the H+ ion concentration is 0.05 M due to the presence of HR. This satisfies the condition for the calculation of the [-]H+ concentration and completes the calculation to reach a pH of approximately 6.89."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-15 01:50:31.245942+00:00"}
