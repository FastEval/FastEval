As an assistant, I have a language processing task that involves finding the name(s) of the country(s) latitudinally and longitudinally reversed. Yes, miss, I do lat/long conversion. The geolocation technology I used is a Holland approachable and relative location tracking system. The system's precision is within approximately 6 meters for latitude and longitude calls on average.
