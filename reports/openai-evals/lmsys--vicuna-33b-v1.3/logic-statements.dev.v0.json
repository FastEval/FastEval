Using the set intersection (∩) and union (∪) operators, we can write this as (S ∩ L) ∪ B.\n\nNow, we want to find the set (S ∩ L). Since every element in S is also an element in L, this is simply S. So, we have S ∪ B.\n\nThe union (∪) of two sets represents the elements that are in either set or both.
