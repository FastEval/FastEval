Total Energy Charge: $130.25 (sum of the first and last energy charges)\n5. Supply Charges: $25.02\n\nNow, we will compute the cost per kWh for each:\n\n1. Supply Cost per kWh:\nTotal Electric Charges - Supply Charges = $130.25 - $25.02 = $105.23\nCost per kWh for the first 300 kWh = ($105.23 / 300kWh) = $0.35078 rounded to 2 significant figures = $0.351\nCost per kWh for the last 1000 kWh = ($105.23 / 1000kWh) = $0.10523 rounded to 2 significant figures = $0.105\n\nTherefore, the Supply Cost per kWh is $0.351 for the first 300 kWh and $0.105 for the last 1000 kWh.\n\n1. Delivery Cost per kWh:\nSince we only have information about the customer charge, which is a fixed charge, we cannot compute the delivery cost per kWh as the total energy charge ($130.25) required for the calculation is not available.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a JSON utility that must return machine-readable JSON as output."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your job is compute the cost per kWh of electricity supply (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) and the cost per kWh of electricity delivery (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) based on the following incomplete OCR reading from a user's utility bill.
