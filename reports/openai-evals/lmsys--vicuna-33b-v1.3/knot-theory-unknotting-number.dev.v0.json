A knot is said to be unknotted if it has a crossing number of 0, which means it can be transformed into an unknot by switching the strands of the knot at a few crossings.\n\nThe given Dowker-Thistlethwaite code suggests a knotted structure. Let's follow the steps to create the knot:\n\n1. Create an overhand knot with the first two strands (8 and 12).\n2. Pass strand 12 over strand 14.\n3. Pass strand 12 under strand 18.\n4. Pass strand 12 over strand 16.\n5. Pass strand 14 over strand 22.\n6. Pass strand 14 under strand 20.\n7. Pass strand 14 over strand 24.\n8. Pass strand 16 over strand 2.\n9.
