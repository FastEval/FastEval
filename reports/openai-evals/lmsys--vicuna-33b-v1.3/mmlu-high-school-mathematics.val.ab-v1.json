Therefore, the area of this part is the area of the first quadrant, which is $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi$.\n\nNext, we consider the region in the third quadrant where $y \\le -|x|+3$. Here, $x = -\\sqrt{y^2}$ and $y \\le - \\sqrt{y^2} + 3$, which simplifies to $3 \\le -y$. So, the area of this part is the area of the third quadrant below the line $y = 3$, which is $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi - \\int\\_{-3}^{0} (3 - |x|) \\: dx$.\n\nNow, we add the areas of both parts:\n\narea = $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi$ + $(\\frac{1}{4} \\pi - \\int\\_{-3}^{0} (3 - |x|) \\: dx)$\n\nTo compute the integral, we split it into two parts depending on the sign of $x$:\n\n$\\int\\_{-3}^{0} (3 - |x|) \\: dx = \\int\\_{-3}^{0} (3 - x) \\: dx + \\int\\_{0}^{-3} (3 + x) \\: dx$\n\nEvaluating these integrals, we get", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nHow many square units are in the region satisfying the inequalities $y \\ge |x|$ and $y \\le -|x|+3$?
