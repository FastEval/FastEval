If M is a 3-sphere with an orientation-reversing isometry, then v(M) = 0.\n2. Otherwise, v(M) = genus(M) - c(M), where genus(M) is the genus of M and c(M) is the number of orientation-reversing isometric involutions (lines of reflection) on M.\n\nFor a knot in a 3-manifold, we can use:\n\n1. If the knot is the unknot, v(M) = 0.\n2. If the knot is a simple closed curve in a 3-sphere, v(M) = 1, and the knot has one orientation.\n\nTaking the second preimage using the Stein's trick formula, we need to find the number of orientation-reversing involutions on the given knot.
