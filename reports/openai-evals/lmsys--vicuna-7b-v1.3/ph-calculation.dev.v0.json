Calculate the pH of this acid solution."}], "ideal": "5.0"}, "sampled": "The pH of a solution can be calculated using the following formula: pH = -log[HA], where [HA] is the concentration of the hydrogen ion (H+) in moles per liter of solution.\n\nTo find [HA], we need to calculate the number of moles of H+ present in the solution. The molar mass of the acid (HA) is equal to the atomic weight of the hydrogen atom, which is approximately 1 g/mol, so the molar mass of HR is the sum of the molar masses of the functional groups.\n\nThe dissociation degree of the acid is defined as the ratio of the moles of H+ present in the acid to the moles of HR present in the solution. In this case, the dissociation degree is 0.125, which means that 12.5% of the acid molecules dissociate into H+ and the conjugate base.\n\nThe formula for the conjugate base of a monoprotic acid can be written as RCOO-, where R is the organic group bound to the carboxyl group. In this case, R is a hydrogen atom, so we can write the formula for the conjugate base as HCOO-, which has a molecular weight of 28 g/mol.\n\nThe number of moles of H+ present in the solution can be calculated as follows:\n\n2 x (0.00008) = 0.00016 x 10^3 mol\n\nThe number of moles of HCOO- present in the solution can be calculated as follows:\n\n0.00016 x 10^3 mol = (0.00008/125) x 2 x 10^3 mol\n\nThe ratio of H+ to HCOO- is therefore:\n\n1.0 x 10^3 = (0.00008/125) x 2\n\nSolving for [HA], we get:\n\n[HA] = 1.0 x 10^3/2.5 = 4.0 x 10^(-3) mol/L\n\nSince the pH of the solution is determined by the number of hydrogen ions present, not the concentration of the conjugate base, we need to divide the concentration of the conjugate base by the concentration of the acid to find the pH of the solution:\n\npH = -log(0.00008/4.0 x 10^(-3)) = 0.667 + 3N log4.0 x 10^(-3)\n\nwhere N is the number of moles of H+ present in 1 liter of solution. Since the concentration of the acid is known to be 0.00008 M, the number of moles of H+ present in 1 liter of solution can be found by multiplying the volume of the solution by the concentration of the acid:\n\nN = (V x 0.00008) / (1 L x 10^28 mol/L) = 0.00000008 L\n\nSubstituting this value into the expression for pH, we get:\n\npH = -log(0.00008/4.0 x 10^(-3)) = 0.667 + 3N log4.0 x 10^(-3)\n\n= 0.667 + log4.0 x 10^(-3) N\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\npH = -3N log4.0 x 10^(-3) + 0.667\n\nTherefore, the pH of the acid solution is approximately 0.64, rounded to one decimal place."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-15 01:09:51.173206+00:00"}
