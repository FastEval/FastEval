With the backdrop of a bloody civil war in Syria, Hancocks investigates the illicit trade in ancient artifacts, including dinosaur bones.\nThe book is well written, intense, and hard-hitting. Hancocks weaves together her personal experiences, interviews with experts, and historical research to create a compelling narrative that keeps readers on the edge of their seats.\nThe Dinosaur Artist is a cautionary tale about the criminal underworld that exists in the shadow of academia and museums. It raises important questions about the ethics of collecting and exhibiting cultural artifacts and the impact of war on the world's archaeological heritage.\nHighly recommended for anyone interested in archaeology, art, and the history of war.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are to answer each given question with a single number, with no extra characters or units.
