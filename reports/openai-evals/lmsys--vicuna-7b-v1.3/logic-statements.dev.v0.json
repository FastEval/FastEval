To make this assertible and quantifiable, we can state:\n∃c ∈ R (c is fruity)\n\nThis is true, and in this case, we can conclude:\n∃c ∈ R (c is fruity and for all w ∈ W, w = c)\n\nThe given implication can be simplified as:\n∃w1, w2, ..., wn ∈ W (all are fruity) ⊃ ∃c ∈ R (c is fruity and for all wi ∈ W, wi = c)\n\nGiven the scarcity of information provided, one must assume the stronger conclusion is true. Therefore, the statement is TRUE (YES)."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-15 01:08:11.506290+00:00"}
