These forces are parallel to the surface of the table and do not act at the same point, so they cancel each other out and the net force on the bar is zero.\n\nIn addition to these forces, there are two other forces (F1 and F2) that act on the bar, and they can be either tension or compression forces. If these forces are applied at the same point, they will cancel out and the net force on the bar will still be zero. However, if they are applied at different points, they will create a non-zero net force on the bar.\n\nThe torque is defined as the product of the force and the distance from the point of application of the force to the axis of rotation. If the two forces (F1 and F2) are applied at the same point, they will act in opposite directions, so their product will be zero. Therefore, the net torque will be zero if F1 and F2 are applied at the same point.\n\nHowever, if the two forces are not applied at the same point, they will create a non-zero net force on the bar, which will also create a non-zero net torque. Therefore, the net torque on the bar is not necessarily zero if F1 and F2 are not applied at the same point.\n\nOption B is incorrect because applied forces do not necessarily determine whether the bar can accelerate translationally or rotationally.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the net torque on the bar is not necessarily zero if F1 and F", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nA uniform bar is lying on a flat table.
