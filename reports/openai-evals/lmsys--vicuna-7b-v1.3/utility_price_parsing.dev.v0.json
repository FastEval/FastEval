However, the provided information only includes the total energy charges for these two periods. We can assume an equal distribution of energy usage between the two periods, which gives a rough estimate of the delivery cost per kWh.\n\nTherefore, we can use the following formula to estimate the delivery cost per kWh:\n\nDelivery cost per kWh = (Energy charge for First 300 kWh + Energy charge for Last 1000 kWh) / Total energy consumed\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nDelivery cost per kWh = (10.00 + 80.00) / 1300\n= 0.0639\n\nSo, the estimated cost per kWh of electricity delivery is approximately $0.064.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a JSON utility that must return machine-readable JSON as output."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your job is compute the cost per kWh of electricity supply (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) and the cost per kWh of electricity delivery (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) based on the following incomplete OCR reading from a user's utility bill.
