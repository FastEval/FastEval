According to the given information, monohybrid inheritance with three alleles and dominance:\n- If a trait is dominant, then only one allele needs to be present in order to express the trait.\n- If a trait is recessive, then both alleles need to be present in order to express the trait.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that:\n- If Blue (BB) crosses with Blue (BB), then both parents contribute the same allele (BB) and the offspring must also inherit the allele (BB) from either parent, resulting in 4/4 Blue (BB) offspring.\n- If Blue (BB) crosses with Blue (GB), then only one parent contributes the allele (BB) to the offspring, resulting in either 4/4 Blue (BB) or 4/4 Blue (GB) offspring.\n- If Blue (BB) crosses with Blue (T), then neither parent contributes the allele (BB) to the offspring, resulting in either 1/4 Blue (BB) or 1/4 Blue (T) offspring.\n\nTherefore, the only possible offspring distribution in this case is: 4/4 Blue (BB).\n\nThis information, along with the calculated genotypes of the parents and offspring, completes the requested solution.\n\nAnswer:\n```\nParents:\n- Blue (BB) x Blue (BB) -> 4/4 Blue (BB)\n- Blue (BB) x Blue (BB) -> 4/4 Blue (BB)\n\nOffspring:\n- Blue (BB) x Blue (BB) -> 4/4 Blue (BB)\n```", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "One type of beetle has 3 possible wing colors, blue, green and turquoise.
