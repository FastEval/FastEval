The former is applied to the cricketer. I don't think 'cricketball' would be suitable.\n\nRe: How do Indians say 'girly cricket' in English, to describing a girl playing cricket?\n\nThat is the correct English translation. From what I understand, passing the time is what is being suggested here. But, to be safe sir, if you want to say that you meant, \"What we call cricketers\", then I would use:\n\n> she is so dedicated.\n\nor\n\n> she so loves cricket.\n\nor\n\n> she is one of us.\n\nor\n\n> she is so into cricket.\n\nor\n\n> she is that much in to cricket.\n\nI agree with all of those translations without exception. The sentence above would have to be confusing for Americans a lot of the time. Which gets back to the positive answer. American English and British English seem like completely different languages, especially in regards to written and formed language, and can fall into the trap of misreading their own language. Since the games themselves are similar in function, and were officially 'unified' in 2009, there might be a point in time where they will become completely the same. But, because of those differences, they would refer to the people of the place you are from before that time.
