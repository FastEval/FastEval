Here are the steps to unknot the given knot using the detergent algorithm:\n\n1. Start with the diagram of the given knot by placing a band under each crossing and joining the endpoints of the band. The bands should meet at right angles at each crossing and indicate how to sports the knot.\n\n```\n4 - _ - _ - 10 - _ - _ - 14 - _ - _ - 16 - _ - _ - 18\n```\n\n2. Cut out a disk bearing the unknot using the detergent algorithm. In this case, we start with a 3-disk diagram:\n\n```\n4 - _ - _ - 10 - _ - _ - 14 - _ - _ - 16 - _ - _ - 18\n```\n\n3. Find two crossing points of the knot in thearchy 1 + 3 that are not active (have the band coming from them). One such point is at 2nd and 4th from left. Initialize the spanning disk with the endpoint of the band passing through these 2 points.\n\n```\n4 - _ - _ - 10 - _ - _ - 14 - _ - _ - - - - _ - _ - 18\n```\n\n4. Fit the spanning disk to the knot and bend the bands following the disk.\n\n```\n4 - _ - _ - 10 - _ - _ - _ - _ - - - - _ - _ - 18\n```\n\n5. Cut out another band from the point 2nd from below. Return to step 2 with the 3-disk diagram.\n\n```\n4 - _ - _ - 10 - _ - _ - _ - _ - - - - _ - _ - 18\n```\n\nNow, one of the bands can be used to reconnect the ends of the bands that were formerlyames, undoing the first step. But in this case, we can use a different band which follows the looped section and comes from the band we cut out in the previous step, completing the unknot:\n```\n4 - _ - _ - 10 - _ - _ - _ - _ - - - - _ - _ - 18\n```", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Determine the unknotting number of the knot, represented in Dowker-Thistlethwaite code.
