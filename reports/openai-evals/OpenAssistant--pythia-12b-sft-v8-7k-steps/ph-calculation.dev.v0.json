Since monoprotic acids have a single acidic Functional Group, we can describe the dissociated hydrogen ions as a singleIGH+ group.\n\nFrom the dissociation equation, we know that each molecule of monoprotic acid can dissociate into one molecule of hydrogen ion (H+) and one molecule of non- dezeity acid (A-). Therefore, the maximum number of hydrogen ions that can be dissociated from one molecule of monoprotic acid (HR) is 1 Leeds™.\n\nNext, we can use the dissociation degree, which is the maximum number of Hey groups that can be dissociated from one molecule of monoprotic acid (HR). In this case, the dissociation degree is 0.1111, which represents the proportion of molecules that have dissociated Hey groups to the total number of molecules.\n\nFinally, we can divide the dissociation degree by the maximum number of dissociation groups (1 Leeds™) to obtain the proportion of dissociated hydrogen ions. In this case, the proportion is 0.1111, which converts to approximately 4.92101 Mad→xebookpages ratio of hydrogen ions.\n\nSince pH is defined as the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration, we can calculate the pH as follows:\n\nlog10[H+] = -log10( spacetimewrite\")(0.00009 Mrs) / 1Ms = -4.92101\n\nTherefore, the pH of the monoprotic acid solution would be approximately 4.92 with one decimal place of precision."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-15 17:16:35.418847+00:00"}
