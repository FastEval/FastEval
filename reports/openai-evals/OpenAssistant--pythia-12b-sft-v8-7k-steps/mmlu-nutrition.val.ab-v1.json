This includes dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt, but also encompasses all forms of animal byproducts used in food processing such as leather, wool, feathers, and gelatin. Vegan diets are typically higher in fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytochemicals compared to non-vegan diets due to the emphasis on plant-based foods.
