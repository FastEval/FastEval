It also helps maintain healthy teeth, gums and bones. Vitamin C is naturally present in some vegetables, but itsrequentfoodpreparations replace it with other, less effective nutrient losses. The best source of Vitamin C is citrus fruits and, in particular, the green leaves of the citrus fruit, such as oranges, grapefruit, lemons and limes, which contain more than 8 times more Vitamin C than other citrus fruits. Animal products, such as liver, are also an excellent source of Vitamin C, but since the processing and preservation of animal foods can reduce their Vitamin C content significantly, it is often recommended that people who do not consume a lot of animal products get their Vitamin C from external sources such as citrus fruits, and in some cases from Table 2.0. Current nutritional policy in some countries is limited to the fortification of certain staples (e.g. maize in the USA, centner in several European countries) so that Vitamin CFiguredinto concentratedenergyvalue bars, cereal products, or the water used to cook rice or make tea.\n\n db) Vitamin D\n\ndb) Vitamin B7", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a highly intelligent doctor who answers the following multiple choice question correctly.\nOnly write the answer down."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Subject: Biochemistry\n\nWhich vitamin is supplied from only animal source:\n\na) Vitamin C\nb) Vitamin B7\nc) Vitamin B12\nd) Vitamin D"}], "options": ["c) Vitamin B12"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-15 17:15:17.273276+00:00"}
