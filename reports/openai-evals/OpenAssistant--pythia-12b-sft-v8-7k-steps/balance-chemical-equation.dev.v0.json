Let's get started.\n\nC6H5COOH + O2 = CO2 + H2O  User's input\n\nWe can see that the compound on the left side of the equation is a organic acid, which means it'll react with air and release carbon dioxide. To balance the equation, we need to find the correct representative molecule for each of the products and the original reactant.\n\nAfter some calculations, I've come up with this balanced equation:\n\n2C6H5COOH + 15O2 = 14CO2 + 6H2O\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The balanced equation tells us that the organic acid (C6H5COOH) is chemically transformed into carbon dioxide (14CO2) and water (6H2O) in the presence of oxygen.\n* The balanced equation tells us that the oxygen is the only reactant in the reaction, and it acts as nothing but a recipient of the chemical products.\n* The balanced equation tells us that there are two molecules of organic acid (C6H5COOH) in the original reactant, but we have removed one molecule of the acid to form carbon dioxide and water.\n* The balanced equation tells us that both products absorb the same number of oxygen molecules as oxygen does in the reactant.\n* The balanced equation tells us that exactly one molecule of each product (carbon dioxide and water) is produced, and the quantities are the same for both products.\n\nNow let's do a side-by-side comparison of the original and balanced equations:\n\nUser's input: C6H5COOH + O2 = CO2 + H2O\n\nBalanced equation: 2C6H5COOH + 15O2 = 14CO2 + 6H2O\n\nIn the original equation, we can see that there are no units specified for either the reactants or the products. However, we can still see from the balanced equation that the oxygen is present in the reactants and products in the same mass ratio.\n\nWe can also see that the number of carbon dioxide and water molecules is the same in the balanced equation as in the original equation. Finally, we can see that exactly one molecule of each product (carbon dioxide and water) is produced in the balanced equation.\n\nIn summary, the balanced equation tells us that the organic acid (C6H5COOH) is consumed and oxygen is the only consumed participant in the chemical reaction.
