Thus, the cost per kWh for Supplier Services is $69.23/251.00 kWh = $0.276056 (rounded to 6 decimal places). However, this cost includes both generation and service charges. Given that the user has consumed 251.00 kWh and was charged $50.20 for the generation services, we can compute the actual cost for generation services as $50.20/251.00 kWh = $0.2 per kWh. Thus, the cost for supply is $0.2 per kWh. Rounding to two significant figures gives $0.22.\n- The total cost for Delivery Services is $26.02 for 251.00 kWh. Thus, the cost per kWh for Delivery Services is $26.02/251.00 kWh = $0.103386 (rounded to 6 decimal places). Rounding to two significant figures gives $0.10 per kWh.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a JSON utility that must return machine-readable JSON as output."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your job is compute the cost per kWh of electricity supply (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) and the cost per kWh of electricity delivery (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) based on the following incomplete OCR reading from a user's utility bill.
