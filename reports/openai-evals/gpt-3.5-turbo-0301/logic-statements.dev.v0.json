The statement \"All roses are flowers\" can be represented as R ⊆ F (which means R is a subset of F). \n\nThe statement \"some flowers fade quickly\" means that there exists a subset of F (let's call it Q) such that Q is not equal to the empty set and all elements of Q fade quickly. \n\nTo prove \"therefore, some roses fade quickly,\" we need to show that there exists a non-empty subset of R that is also a subset of Q. \n\nSince R ⊆ F and Q is a subset of F, we can consider the intersection of R and Q, denoted by R ∩ Q. \n\nIf R ∩ Q is not empty, then we have found a non-empty subset of R (namely R ∩ Q) that is also a subset of Q, and we can conclude that some roses fade quickly. \n\nIf R ∩ Q is empty, then there is no rose that fades quickly in Q, and we cannot conclude that some roses fade quickly. \n\nTherefore, we need to know more about Q to determine whether the statement is true or false.
