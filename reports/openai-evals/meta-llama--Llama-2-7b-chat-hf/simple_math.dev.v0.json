Let's call this speed \"s\" in kilometers per hour.\nThe distance between Ankara and Izmir is approximately 450 kilometers.\nTo find the time it takes for 12 cars to travel this distance, we can use the formula:\ntime = distance / speed\nPlugging in the values we know, we get:\ntime = 450 km / s km/h = ?\n[Note: I have rounded the numerical answer to 4 decimal places.]\nNow, let's see how we can calculate the speed \"s\" for the 12 cars:\nSince the first 6 cars take 9 hours to travel the distance, we can assume that the 12 cars will also take the same amount of time. Therefore, the speed of the 12 cars is also 9 hours / 450 km = 0.21 km/h.\nSo, the time it takes for 12 cars to travel from Ankara to Izmir is:\ntime = 450 km / 0.21 km/h = 2045.45 hours [rounded to 4 decimal places: 2045.5 hours]\nTherefore, the answer to the question is 2045.5 hours."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-21 19:08:06.172075+00:00"}
