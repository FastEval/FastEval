Organize all variables within each term in alphabetical order:\n\n* b = 2*x + 1\n* c = 3*x^2 - 4*x + 5\n* d = 4*x^3 - 5*x^2 + 2*x - 3\n* e = x^4 + 2*x^3 - x^2 - 3*x + 2\n* f = x^5 + 3*x^4 - 4*x^3 + 5*x^2 - 2*x + 1\n5. Arrange each term according to an increasing power of their corresponding exponents:\n\n* b = 2*x + 1\n* c = 3*x^2 - 4*x + 5\n* d = 4*x^3 - 5*x^2 + 2*x - 3\n* e = x^4 + 2*x^3 - x^2 - 3*x + 2\n* f = x^5 + 3*x^4 - 4*x^3 + 5*x^2 - 2*x + 1\n6. In cases where several terms have identical exponents, arrange these terms in ascending order based on their derivative level:\n\n* b = 2*x + 1\n* c = 3*x^2 - 4*x + 5\n* d = 4*x^3 - 5*x^2 + 2*x - 3\n* e = x^4 + 2*x^3 - x^2 - 3*x + 2\n* f = x^5 + 3*x^4 - 4*x^3 + 5*x^2 - 2*x + 1\n\n7. If terms are independent of the variable 'x' (such as 'f''(x)'), these terms should be sequenced last:\n* f = x^5 + 3*x^4 - 4*x^3 + 5*x^2 - 2*x + 1\n\nTherefore, the derivative of the given function with respect to x is:\na(b(c(d(e(f(x)))))) = (d(e(f(x)))) + (c(d(e(f(x)))))) + (b(c(d(e(f(x)))))) + f(x)\n= d(e(f(x))) + c(d(e(f(x)))) + b(c(d(e(f(x)))))) + e(f(x)) + f(x)\n= (x^4 + 2*x^3 - x^2 - 3*x + 2)*(4*x^3 - 5*x^2 + 2*x - 3) + (x^3 - 4*x^2 + 5*x - 2)*(3*x^2 - 4"}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-21 19:36:21.857913+00:00"}
