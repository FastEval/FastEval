Since the components are identical, they can appear in any order, so this rule does not apply.\nFrom rule 3, we know that if component b exists in the system, then it must appear more than once.

Since the system consists of three identical components, component c is not the last or penultimate component.\nFrom rule 5, we know that as long as component a appears, component b must appear.
