We need to show that $(g \\circ f)(n) = n$.\n\nIf $n$ is even, i.e., $n = 2m$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{{N}}$, then $(g \\circ f)(n) = g(f(n)) = g((1, m)) = 2m$. This shows that $(g \\circ f)(n) = n$.\n\nIf $n$ is odd, i.e., $n = 2m-1$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{{N}}$, then $(g \\circ f)(n) = g(f(n)) = g((2, m)) = 2m-1$.

Here is the corrected proof:\n```coq\nFrom Coq Require Import ssr.ssreflect.\nLemma section_equal_involutive : forall {X} f s,\n  involutive f ->\n  cancel s f ->\n  forall x : X, f x = s x.\nProof.\n  move=> X f s H_inv H_can x.\n  rewrite -{1}(H_can x).\n  rewrite H_inv.\n  import ssr.involutive.\n  reflexivity.\nQed.\n```\nIn this corrected proof, we have added the `import ssr.involutive` line to import the `involutive` definition from the `ssr` module. This line is necessary to make the proof work, as the `involutive` definition is not automatically imported in the current environment.\nWith this fix, the proof should now compile without any errors.\n***\n[Criterion]: The answer asserts that Coq could not find the definition for `involutive` and identifies that `involutive` is defined in `ssr.ssrfun` not `ssr.ssreflect`.  Additionally, the answer must contain a code block at the end that starts by importing both `ssreflect` (or `ssr.ssreflect`) and `ssrfun` (or `ssr.ssrfun`).  The code block *must not* contain any other requires/imports.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?

We will show that the statement \"every section $s : X \\to X$ of $f$ is equal to $f$\" is false by providing a counter-example.\n\nCounter-example: Let $X = \\{{0,1\\}}$ and define $f : X \\to X$ by $f(0) = 1$ and $f(1) = 0$.

We can see that $id_X$ is a section of $f$ by checking that $f(id_X(0)) = f(0) = 1$ and $f(id_X(1)) = f(1) = 0$, which implies that $id_X$ satisfies the condition for being a section of $f$: $f \\circ id_X = id_X$.\n\nSecond, let $s : X \\to X$ be the function defined by $s(0) = 1$ and $s(1) = 0$.

This is because the formal proof template Coq code includes a definition for `even_odd_dec`, but the translated Coq code does not have the same definition.\nIn the formal proof, the `even_odd_dec` function is defined as a local definition in the `Definition` section. However, in the translated Coq code, the `even_odd_dec` function is not defined, and Coq is complaining about the lack of this definition.\nTo fix this issue, we need to include the definition of `even_odd_dec` in the translated Coq code. One way to do this is to add the definition directly after the `Definition` section, as shown below:\n```coq\nRequire Import Arith.\n\nDefinition even_odd_dec (n : nat) : Prop :=\n  match n with\n  | 0 => True\n  | 1 => False\n  | _ => even_odd_dec (n - 1)\n  end.\n\n```\nBy including this definition in the translated Coq code, we are telling Coq that the `even_odd_dec` function is available in the current environment, and the error message should be resolved.\n***\n[Criterion]: The answer indicates that `even_odd_dec` is not found.  The answer either indicates that `even_odd_dec` can be used by importing `Coq.Arith.Even`, or indicates that `even_odd_dec` used to be available in `Coq.Arith.Even` but has been removed.

The subterm \"?M1064 * ?M1065 / ?M1065\" is likely a part of the definition of the function f, which is defined as follows:\nf (n) = \nmatch Nat.even n with\n| true => inl (n / 2)\n| false => inr ((n - 1) / 2)\nend.\nThe error message suggests that the subterm \"?M1064 * ?M1065 / ?M1065\" is not present in the definition of f, or it is not possible to match it with any term in the current goal.\n[/INST]  The issue with the Coq code translation is that the definition of the function `f` does not include the subterm `?M1064 * ?M1065 / ?M1065`, which is present in the formal proof. The formal proof uses this subterm in the definition of `g`, the inverse of `f`, but the Coq code translation does not include it.\nThe `match` construct in Coq does not allow for the use of subterms, so the definition of `f` in the Coq code does not include the subterm `?M1064 * ?M1065 / ?M1065`. To fix the error, the Coq code translation should include the subterm in the definition of `f`, for example:\nf (n) =\nmatch Nat.even n with\n| true => inl (n / 2 * ?M1064 / ?M1065)\n| false => inr ((n - 1) / 2 * ?M1064 / ?M1065)\nend.\nThis will allow the Coq code translation to find the subterm `?M1064 * ?M1065 / ?M1065` in the definition of `f`, and the proof will be successful.\n***\n[Criterion]: The answer indicates that `Nat.div_mul` applies to goals of the form `a * b / b = a`, which is `(a * b) / b`.

In the `Proof` section, the `Admitted` tactic is used to prove the lemma without providing any actual proof. In Coq, the `Admitted` tactic is only allowed in the context of a `Definition` or `Inductive` declaration, and it cannot be used in a `Proof` section.\n2. In the `Lemma counter_example` definition, the `exists` keyword is used to define a variable `X` and a function `f`, but the definition of `f` is not given. In Coq, the `exists` keyword must be followed by a term of the same type as the variable being defined.\n3. In the `Proof` section, the `split` tactic is used to unfold the definition of `involutive` and `cancel`, but these definitions are not given in the code. In Coq, the `split` tactic must be used with a term that can be split, and the term must be of the same type as the variable being split.\n4. In the `intros` tactic, the `apply/boolP` tactic is used to apply the `boolP` tactic to the goal, but the `boolP` tactic is not defined in the code. In Coq, the `apply` tactic must be used with a term that can be applied to the goal, and the term must be of the same type as the goal.\n5. In the `case: x` tactic, the `reflexivity` tactic is used to prove that the goal is true for any value of `x`, but the `reflexivity` tactic is not defined in the code. In Coq, the `reflexivity` tactic must be used with a term that is true for any value of the variable being proved.\n6. In the `Qed` statement, the `by move=> H` tactic is used to move the goal to the next line, but the `H` variable is not defined in the code. In Coq, the `by move` tactic must be used with a term that can be moved to the next line, and the term must be of the same type as the goal.\n\nOverall, the code translation failed to provide a correct proof of the lemma, and it contains several syntax errors and logical mistakes.\n***\n[Criterion]: The answer explains that the error is a syntax error due to the SSReflect extension not being properly loaded due to a missing import of `ssreflect`, which is not the same as `ssr.ssrfun`.  Additionally, the answer should not mention `mathcomp`, should not suggest inserting spaces.  The answer should not indicate that `apply/lemma`, `apply/`, `apply/boolP`, `/` is invalid syntax in general.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?

We need to show that $(g \\circ f)(n) = n$.\n\nIf $n$ is even, i.e., $n = 2m$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{{N}}$, then $(g \\circ f)(n) = g(f(n)) = g((1, m)) = 2m$. This shows that $(g \\circ f)(n) = n$.\n\nIf $n$ is odd, i.e., $n = 2m-1$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{{N}}$, then $(g \\circ f)(n) = g(f(n)) = g((2, m)) = 2m-1$. This also shows that $(g \\circ f)(n) = n$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $g \\circ f = \\mathrm{{id}}_\\mathbb{{N}}$.\n\nNext, we will show that $f \\circ g = \\mathrm{{id}}_{{\\mathbb{{N}} \\sqcup \\mathbb{{N}}}}$.\n\nLet $(i, m) \\in \\mathbb{{N}} \\sqcup \\mathbb{{N}}$. We need to show that $(f \\circ g)(i, m) = (i, m)$.\n\nIf $i = 1$, then $(f \\circ g)(i, m) = f(g(i, m)) = f(2m) = (1, m)$. This shows that $(f \\circ g)(i, m) = (i, m)$.\n\nIf $i = 2$, then $(f \\circ g)(i, m) = f(g(i, m)) = f(2m-1) = (2, m)$.

We can see that $id_X$ is a section of $f$ by checking that $f(id_X(0)) = f(0) = 1$ and $f(id_X(1)) = f(1) = 0$, which implies that $id_X$ satisfies the condition for being a section of $f$: $f \\circ id_X = id_X$.\n\nSecond, let $s : X \\to X$ be the function defined by $s(0) = 1$ and $s(1) = 0$. We can see that $s$ is also a section of $f$ by checking that $f(s(0)) = f(1) = 0$ and $f(s(1)) = f(0) = 1$, which implies that $s$ satisfies the condition for being a section of $f$: $f \\circ s = s$.\n\nHowever, $id_X$ and $f$ are not equal, since $id_X(0) = 0$ and $f(0) = 1$. Therefore, not every section of $f$ is equal to $f$. \n\nThus, we have shown that the statement \"every section $s : X \\to X$ of $f$ is equal to $f$\" is false by providing a counter-example.\nFORMAL PROOF TRANSLATED TO COQ:\n```coq\nFrom Coq Require Import ssreflect ssrfun.\n\nLemma section_equal_involutive_counter_example : exists X f s,\n  involutive f /\\\n  cancel s f /\\\n  exists x : X, f x <> s x.\nProof.\n  exists bool, (fun b : bool => negb b), (fun b : bool => b).\n  split; [|split].\n  - move=> b; case: b. by []. by [].\n  - move=> b; case: b. by []. by [].\n  - exists true. by [].\nQed.\n```\nERROR MESSAGE:\nstdout:\n```\nFile \"./Solution.v\", line 11, characters 23-28:\nError: No applicable tactic.\n\nLine 11 is:\n  - move=> b; case: b. by []. by [].\n\nCharacters 23-28 are `by []`\n\n```\nstderr:\n```\n\n```\nError:\n```\n1\n```\nCODE WITH MORE DEBUGGING INFORMATION:\n"}], "criteria": "The answer inserts `Show.` between the first `move=> b; case: b.` and `by [].`.

We can see that $id_X$ is a section of $f$ by checking that $f(id_X(0)) = f(0) = 1$ and $f(id_X(1)) = f(1) = 0$, which implies that $id_X$ satisfies the condition for being a section of $f$: $f \\circ id_X = id_X$.\n\nSecond, let $s : X \\to X$ be the function defined by $s(0) = 1$ and $s(1) = 0$.

We will show that the statement \"every section $s : X \\to X$ of $f$ is equal to $f$\" is false by providing a counter-example.\n\nCounter-example: Let $X = \\{{0,1\\}}$ and define $f : X \\to X$ by $f(0) = 1$ and $f(1) = 0$. Then $f$ is involutive, since $f(f(0)) = f(1) = 0$ and $f(f(1)) = f(0) = 1$. \n\nNow, we will show that there are two sections of $f$: the identity function $id_X$ and $f$ itself. \n\nFirst, let $id_X : X \\to X$ be the identity function, defined by $id_X(x) = x$ for all $x \\in X$. We can see that $id_X$ is a section of $f$ by checking that $f(id_X(0)) = f(0) = 1$ and $f(id_X(1)) = f(1) = 0$, which implies that $id_X$ satisfies the condition for being a section of $f$: $f \\circ id_X = id_X$.\n\nSecond, let $s : X \\to X$ be the function defined by $s(0) = 1$ and $s(1) = 0$. We can see that $s$ is also a section of $f$ by checking that $f(s(0)) = f(1) = 0$ and $f(s(1)) = f(0) = 1$, which implies that $s$ satisfies the condition for being a section of $f$: $f \\circ s = s$.\n\nHowever, $id_X$ and $f$ are not equal, since $id_X(0) = 0$ and $f(0) = 1$.

We need to show that $n_1 = n_2$.\n\nCase 1: $n_1$ and $n_2$ are both even.\nIn this case, we have $f(n_1) = 1\\cdot n_1/2$ and $f(n_2) = 1\\cdot n_2/2$. Since $f(n_1) = f(n_2)$, we have $1\\cdot n_1/2 = 1\\cdot n_2/2$. Multiplying both sides by $2$ gives us $n_1 = n_2$.\n\nCase 2: $n_1$ and $n_2$ are both odd.\nIn this case, we have $f(n_1) = 2\\cdot(n_1-1)/2$ and $f(n_2) = 2\\cdot(n_2-1)/2$. Since $f(n_1) = f(n_2)$, we have $2\\cdot(n_1-1)/2 = 2\\cdot(n_2-1)/2$. Simplifying, we get $n_1-1 = n_2-1$, which implies $n_1 = n_2$.\n\nCase 3: $n_1$ is even and $n_2$ is odd, or vice versa.\nIn this case, $f(n_1)$ and $f(n_2)$ belong to different copies of $\\mathbb{{N}}$. Therefore, $f(n_1) \\neq f(n_2)$.\n\nSince $n_1 = n_2$ in all possible cases, we conclude that $f$ is injective.\n\n2. **Surjective (Onto)**:\n\nLet $m$ be an element of $\\mathbb{{N}} \\sqcup \\mathbb{{N}}$. We need to show that there exists $n$ in $\\mathbb{{N}}$ such that $f(n) = m$.\n\nCase 1: $m$ belongs to the first copy of $\\mathbb{{N}}$.\nIn this case, $m = 1\\cdot n/2$ for some even natural number $n$. Let $n = 2m$. Then, $f(n) = 1\\cdot n/2 = 1\\cdot (2m)/2 = m$. Therefore, $f(n) = m$.\n\nCase 2: $m$ belongs to the second copy of $\\mathbb{{N}}$.\nIn this case, $m = 2\\cdot(n-1)/2$ for some odd natural number $n$. Let $n = 2m+1$. Then, $f(n) = 2\\cdot(n-1)/2 = 2\\cdot((2m+1)-1)/2 = m$. Therefore, $f(n) = m$.\n\nSince every element of $\\mathbb{{N}} \\sqcup \\mathbb{{N}}$ has a preimage in $\\mathbb{{N}}$, we conclude that $f$ is surjective.\n\nSince $f$ is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection.
