Based on the information provided, the total amount of electricity consumed during the on-peak and off-peak periods is:\n\nOn-peak: 140.2 kWh\nOff-peak: 200.2 kWh\n\nNow, let's multiply the total amount of electricity consumed during each period by the respective rate per kWh:\n\nOn-peak: $0.25 x 140.2 kWh = $35.10\nOff-peak: $0.15 x 200.2 kWh = $30.10\n\nSo, the total cost of electricity supply based on the on-peak and off-peak usage is:\n\n$35.10 + $30.10 = $65.20\n\nNext, let's move on to calculating the cost of electricity delivery. The delivery charge is $60.20, so the cost per kWh of electricity delivery is:\n\n$60.20 ÷ 602.0 kWh (total delivery charge) = $0.10 per kWh\n\nTherefore, the JSON output for the cost per kWh of electricity supply and delivery based on the information provided in the utility bill would be:\n\n{'supply_cost_per_kwh': $65.20, 'delivery_cost_per_kwh': $0.10}", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a JSON utility that must return machine-readable JSON as output."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your job is compute the cost per kWh of electricity supply (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) and the cost per kWh of electricity delivery (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) based on the following incomplete OCR reading from a user's utility bill.
