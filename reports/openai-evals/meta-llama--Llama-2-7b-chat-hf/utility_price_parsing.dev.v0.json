The energy charge is calculated by multiplying the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) consumed by the energy charge rate, which is 0.052 cents per kWh in this case. Therefore, the energy charge for 423 kWh consumed is:\n\nenergy_charge = 0.052 x 423 kWh = $22.00\n\nNext, let's calculate the delivery services charge. The delivery services charge is calculated by multiplying the number of kWh consumed by the delivery services charge rate, which is 0.012 cents per kWh in this case. Therefore, the delivery services charge for 423 kWh consumed is:\n\ndelivery_services_charge = 0.012 x 423 kWh = $5.07\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total delivery services charge by adding the energy charge and the delivery services charge:\n\ntotal_delivery_services_charge = energy_charge + delivery_services_charge = $22.00 + $5.07 = $27.06\n\nTherefore, the JSON output for the cost per kWh of electricity supply and delivery based on the information provided in the utility bill is:\n\n{\n\"supply_cost_per_kwh\": \"$22.00\",\n\"delivery_cost_per_kwh\": \"$27.06\"\n}", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a JSON utility that must return machine-readable JSON as output."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your job is compute the cost per kWh of electricity supply (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) and the cost per kWh of electricity delivery (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) based on the following incomplete OCR reading from a user's utility bill.
