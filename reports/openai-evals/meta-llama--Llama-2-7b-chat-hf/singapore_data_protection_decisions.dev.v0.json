The central issue to this case, in \nso far as it is related to the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”), is \nwhether the Organisation had made reasonable security arrangements to protect \nthe personal data of the students and students’ parents that it had in its \npossession and control at the material time. \nMaterial Facts \n2 \nOne of the many preschools under the Organisation’s management is the \nSparkletots @ Kampong Chai Chee centre (the “preschool”). In the course of \nthe year, the preschool would organise various school trips, sometimes with the \nparticipation of the parents. In preparation for these trips, the preschool would \ncollect the parents’ personal data (including NRIC numbers) to allow for \nverification of the parents’ identity on the day of the trip. \n3 \nThe present investigations arise from one such school trip. A few days \nbefore the trip was scheduled to take place, a teacher at the preschool sent a \nphotograph of a consolidated attendance list to a “WhatsApp” chat group, \nreminding parents of the upcoming school trip. The attendance list contained \npersonal data relating to the 15 students in that particular class and their parents, \nand included the contact numbers and NRIC numbers of five of the parents (the \n“Personal Data”). The “WhatsApp” chat group comprised of the parents of \nstudents from that class. \n4 \nThe teacher who sent the photograph of the attendance list quickly \ndeleted it after being alerted to the disclosure of personal data by one of the \nparents within the group chat. That same parent later lodged a complaint with \nthe Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”). The PDPC thereafter \ncommenced investigations into the incident. \nConclusion  \n14 \nHaving found the Organisation to be in breach of section 24 of the \nPDPA, I am empowered under Section 29 of the PDPA to give the Organisation \nsuch directions as he deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. \n15 \nIn determining the appropriate directions to be imposed on The \nOrganisation, I have taken into account the following mitigating factors:  \n(a) \nThe teacher in question acted swiftly in removing the Personal \nData from the “WhatsApp” group; and \n(b) \nThe number of individuals impacted by the disclosure (15 \nstudents and 30 parents) was relatively small and the disclosure was \nconstrained to the group of parents to whom the Personal Data pertained \nto. \n16 \nTo its credit, the Organisation also acted swiftly to address their \ninadequate policies – a response which, in my assessment, carries mitigating \nvalue. The following remedial actions taken by the Organisation have therefore \nbeen taken into account: \n(a) \nImmediate suspension of all “WhatsApp” chat groups following \nthe disclosure;  \n(b) \nExpedited the implementation of a set of “Social Media Policy / \nWhatsapp chat group rules” that was already under development when \nthe breach occurred; \n(c) \nRolled out a suite of other policies across the Organisation \nincluding a “Document Retention Policy” and an “Information Security \nPolicy”; and \n(d) \nUndertook the development of a practical employee handbook \nand conducted refresher training for its employees. \n17 \nHaving considered all the relevant factors of the case, I am of the view \nthat these remedial actions have sufficiently addressed the current gap in \npolicies and practices relating to the handling of personal data by the \nOrganisation’s employees. I have therefore decided to issue a warning to the \nOrganisation for breaching its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA, \nwithout further directions or imposing a financial penalty. \n     \nYEONG ZEE KIN \nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER \nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nQuery: What is the Commission’s approach to cases involving effects on children or minors?"}], "sampled": "Relevant paragraphs: 2, 4, 16(b), 17\nNote: These paragraphs are relevant to answering the query as they provide insights into the Commission's approach to cases involving effects on children or minors, as well as the remedial actions taken by the Organisation to address such breaches."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-21 19:07:38.140554+00:00"}

Henry Park Primary School Parents’ Association (the “Organisation”) is a registered \nsociety whose membership comprised parent volunteers. To register as members of the \nOrganisation, individuals provided to the Organisation their names, contact numbers, name \nof child and the child’s class in Henry Park Primary School (the “Personal Data Set”). The \nOrganisation had a website at https://hppa.org.sg (the “Website”) where members could \nview their own account particulars upon logging in using their assigned user ID and \npassword. \n \n2. On 15 March 2019, the Personal Data Protection Commission (“the Commission”) \nreceived a complaint. The complainant informed that when she performed a Google search \nusing her name, she found a search result of a webpage of the Website which disclosed her \npersonal data (the “Incident”). \n\n3. The Personal Data Sets of registered members were never intended to be disclosed online. \nThe Website had been developed by a parent volunteer using the WordPress content \nmanagement system.  \n \n4. The Organisation had conducted tests to verify that members who logged in to the Website \ncould view their own account particulars. The Organisation also verified that account \nparticulars could not be viewed when accessing the Website as a public user. Nevertheless, \nthe Personal Data Set was crawled, indexed and searchable by Google. This points to a \nweakness in access control that had not been picked up by these rudimentary tests.  \n \n5. Security testing such as vulnerability scans would have identified the access control issue. \nThe Organisation failed to conduct adequate security testing  before launching the Website. \nOn the above facts, the Commission found that the Organisation did not put in place \nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Personal Data Sets. \n \n6. The Commission  also found that the Organisation had not appointed a person to be \nresponsible for ensuring its compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the \n“PDPA”). Further, the Organisation had not developed and implemented any policies and \npractices necessary for it to meet its obligations under the PDPA.  \n \n7. The Organisation had taken the Website offline after the Incident on 15 March 2019. On \n14 November 2019, the Organisation had put online a new website that no longer allowed \nonline access to the database of the Organisation’s members. The new website also \nincluded a data protection notice. \n \n8. In the circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection found the \nOrganisation in breach of sections 11(3), 12 and 24 of the PDPA. In determining the \ndirections, the Deputy Commissioner took into consideration that the Organisation was a \nvolunteer organisation made up primarily of parents.   The Organisation is directed to, \nwithin 60 days, (i) appoint one or more individuals to be responsible for ensuring that it \ncomplies with the PDPA, (ii) develop and implement internal data protection and training \npolicies, and (iii) to put all volunteers handling personal data through data protection \ntraining.  \n\nQuery: What is the Commission’s approach to cases involving effects on children or minors?"}], "sampled": "Relevant paragraphs:\n* 3: The Personal Data Sets of registered members were never intended to be disclosed online.\n* 6: The Commission also found that the Organisation had not appointed a person to be responsible for ensuring its compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012.\n* 8: In the circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection found the Organisation in breach of sections 11(3), 12 and 24 of the PDPA."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-21 19:07:39.958730+00:00"}

Its membership programme, \nknown as “homeclub by COURTS” (“Homeclub”) gives its members \n(“Members”) exclusive access to, among other things, events and discounts. \nThe Organisation regularly sends eDMs to Members with links to specific \nproducts on the Organisation’s website (the “Website”).  \n3 \nThe Organisation used a platform called Salesforce to create and send \neDMs (the “Platform”) and the Website ran on the Magento system1 (the \n“System”), an e-commerce platform. The System generated a dynamic session \nidentifier (“SID”) for each login to Homeclub on the Website. This SID would \nbe used for all subsequent activities within the session.  \n4 \nOn 31 August 2019, the Organisation sent an eDM to 76,844 Members \n(the “Affected Members”). This eDM, included for the first time, the New \neDM Link, which was meant to direct Members to the Homeclub login page. \nThe purpose of the New eDM Link was for Members to log in to their respective \nHomeclub accounts to update their membership identifier – Members were \nrequired to provide their mobile numbers to replace NRIC numbers that were \npreviously used as the membership identifier.  \n5 \nThe New eDM Link did not operate as intended, resulting in the \nIncident. The Commission’s investigations revealed the following:  \n(a) \nNotwithstanding that the eDM sent on 31 August 2019 included \nfor the first time the New eDM Link, the Organisation continued to use \nthe System in its default setting. The default setting comprised (i) the \nSID embedded in the URL of the New eDM Link; and (ii) cookie \nsettings to be refreshed after 60 minutes.  \n(b) \nThe default setting had not caused any issues when it was used \nby the Organisation to send marketing eDMs with eDM links directing \nMembers to specific products on the Website. As Members were not  \nrequired to log in to their accounts in order to view the specific products, \nthe SID embedded in the URL and cookie settings did not affect the \nfunctioning of the Website.   \n(c) \nHowever, the default setting should not have been used for the \nNew eDM Link – it led to the System assuming that every use of the \nNew eDM Link within 60 minutes of a Member’s login was part of the \nsame session. This meant that:  \n(i) \nIf Member X clicks on the New eDM Link and logs into \nhis Homeclub account without logging out within 60 minutes, all \nother Members who subsequently clicked on the New eDM Link \nwithin 60 minutes of Member X’s login would automatically be \ndirected to Member X’s account, without having to authenticate \ntheir credentials; and  \n(ii) \nIf Member X logged out while other Members were still \nlogged into Member X’s account, the other Members would only \nbe logged out of Member X’s account if they refreshed a page or \nnavigated to other pages within Member X’s account. \n6 \nAccording to the Organisation, 128 of the Affected Members clicked on \nthe New eDM Link between approximately 8am on 31 August 2019 and \n12.25am on 1 September 2019. The Incident led to the risk of unauthorised \naccess and modification of personal data in the Affected Members’ respective \nHomeclub accounts. In this regard, each Member’s Homeclub account \ncomprised (i) account information; and (ii) address book, which collectively \ncontained the following data (“Personal Data Set”): \n(a) Name;  \n(b) Email address: \n(c) Mobile Number; \n(d) Date of Birth (“DOB”); \n(e) Address; \n(f) Password; and  \n(g) Transactional information i.e. products previously purchased by \na Member.  \n7 \nIn addition to unauthorised access, the following types of personal data \nin the Affected Members’ Personal Data Sets were at risk of unauthorised \nmodification as a result of the Incident:  \n(a) The Affected Member’s name, DOB, mobile number and \nresidential address from his/her account information; and \n(b) The Affected Member’s name, mobile number and residential \naddress from his/her address book.  \n8 \nThe risk of unauthorised modification in [7(a)] and [7(b)] was possible \nbecause password verification was not required to make these changes. \nConversely, an Affected Members’ username (which was his/her email address) \nand password could not be modified without password verification. An Affected \nMember’s Personal Data Sets also could not be downloaded by another Member \nwho had accessed his/her account because there was no download function on \nthe Website. \n9 \nThere was no risk of financial loss to Affected Members through the \nIncident. While it was possible for another Member (who was given access to \nMember X’s account) to make a purchase through Member X’s account, he/she \nwould have to provide credit card details to complete the purchase. This was \nbecause financial information (i.e. credit card details) was not stored in the \nSystem, and there was no reward system in Homeclub for the redemption of \nproducts or benefits.  \n10 \nBased on the Organisation’s investigations into the Incident, there was \nno evidence of any unauthorised modification to the Affected Members’ \nPersonal Data Sets. Other than the Affected Member who had notified the \nOrganisation of the Incident, the Organisation did not receive any further \ncomplaints or feedback.  \n11 \nUpon being notified of the Incident on the same day, the Organisation \npromptly took the following remedial actions:  \n(a) Fixed the error that caused the Incident at approximately \n12:25am on 1 September 2019 by changing the setting for “Use SID on \nStorefront” to “No”; \n(b) Implemented password verification for any changes to \nMembers’ account information and address book;\n(c) Put in place a standard operating procedure (“SOP”) to ensure \ncorrect link insertion into eDMs to protect personal data. For eDM links \nthat are supposed to lead to a login page, checks will be conducted to \nensure that there will be multiple concurrent user testing; \n(d) Took steps to engage an external vendor to work on security \nmatters (including data protection security), and disseminate this \ninformation to its employees; and \n(e) Emailed the 128 Affected Members who had clicked on the New \neDM Link to inform them of the Incident.  \nThe Commissioner’s Directions \n18 \nIn determining the directions, if any, to be imposed on the Organisation \nunder Section 29 of the PDPA, the Commissioner took into account as an \naggravating factor that this is the second time the Organisation has been found \nin breach of the Protection Obligation. The Commissioner also took into \naccount the following mitigating factors:  \n(a) \nThe Organisation cooperated with the investigations and \nprovided prompt responses to the Commission’s requests for \ninformation; \n(b) \nThe Organisation implemented remedial actions swiftly to \naddress the Incident; and  \n(c) \nThe Members’ Personal Data Sets was exposed to the risk of \nunauthorised access and/or modification for a limited period of less than \none day.  \n19 \nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner \nhereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of S$9,000 within 30 \ndays from the date of this direction, failing which interest, at the rate specified \nin the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue and be payable \non the outstanding amount of the financial penalty until it is paid in full.

Organisations \n \nDecision Citation: [2017] SGPDPC 11 \nGROUNDS OF DECISION \n29 June 2017 \n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS \n \n10. The information that was contained in the logbook, namely, the NRIC number \nand the dates and times of the entry and departure from the Condominium, would \nconstitute “personal data” under Section 2 of the PDPA of the coaches who came \nto the Condominium. The information allows for the identification of the individual, \nand the date and timings in which the individual had entered and left the \npremises. In particular, the NRIC numbers of the coaches are generally \nconsidered to be of a sensitive nature, as it is widely used for business purposes \nand transactions with the government,1 and could be used to cause harm should \nsuch information fall into the wrong hands.  \n \n11. Accordingly, since the logbook contains personal data of the individual coaches, \nit must be protected under Section 24 of the PDPA.  \n \n12. The issues that arise from this case are as follow:   \ni. What was the relationship between MCST 3696 and Eagle, and what were \ntheir respective obligations under the PDPA;  \nii. Whether MCST 3696 and Eagle Eye complied with their respective \nobligations under the PDPA.  \n \nRelationship between MCST 3696 and Eagle Eye and their respective obligations \n13. The MCST 3696 had engaged Eagle Eye to provide security guard services \npursuant to an agreement on 15 August 2016.  \n \n14. As part of the security services, Eagle Eye was to record the movement of \npersons entering or leaving the premises of the Condominium. This included the \nmaintaining a logbook of coaches who were entering or leaving the premises of \nthe Condominium.   \n \n15. The recording and safekeeping of the logbook were activities that fall under the \ndefinition of “processing” of personal data under Section 2(1) of the PDPA. Given \nthat MCST 3696 had engaged Eagle Eye to carry out such services (as part of \nthe overall security services), Eagle Eye was a data intermediary to MCST 3696 \n(the organisation) in relation to the handling and safekeeping of the logbook.  \n \n16. As an organisation, MCST 3696 has the primary role and duty to protect personal \ndata in its possession or control under Section 24 of the PDPA. The organisation \nheld the primary role and duty to protect personal data, even though it had \nengaged a data intermediary to protect the personal data as well. This principle \nhas been elucidated in the case of The Cellar Door Pte Ltd and Global Interactive \nWorks Pte. Ltd. [2016] SGPDPC 22. As for Eagle Eye, although it has fewer \nobligations to meet under the PDPA (pursuant to section 4(2) of the PDPA), it \nstill needs to protect personal data in its possession under Section 24 of the \nPDPA.  \n \n17. We now turn to examine whether MCST 3696 and Eagle Eye have complied with \ntheir respective obligations to protect the logbook under Section 24 of the PDPA.  \n \nWhether MCST 3696 and Eagle Eye have complied with their respective obligations \nto protect personal data under Section 24 of the PDPA \n18. In relation to Eagle Eye, the Commission has found Eagle Eye to be in breach of \nits obligations under Section 24 of the PDPA.  \n \n19. First, whilst Eagle Eye claims that it had informed the security guard to keep the \nlogbook closed when not in use and to keep the book in the guardhouse if no \nsecurity guard was stationed at the table, the instructions were clearly ineffective, \nas none of the security guards had carried out those instructions. As the \nComplainant had found on 16 October 2016, the logbook was left unattended \nand open on the table. Further, the instructions themselves were bare and \nincomplete, as they do not, for example, inform the security guards how to \norganise themselves to ensure that the logbook is closed at all times when not \nin use, or who was responsible to carry out the task. The failure by Eagle Eye to \nprovide proper instructions to its security guards was a dereliction of its duty to \nensure that there were reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal \ndata in the logbook.  \n \n20. Moreover, it was not enough for the organisation to simply provide instructions \nto the security guards to safekeep the logbook without doing more – ie putting in \nplace actual processes or practices to protect the logbook. Without having actual \nprocesses or practices in place to protect personal data, Eagle Eye’s instructions \nwere but empty instructions with little effect. This can be seen in the manner in \nwhich the security of the logbook appears to have been carried: on an ad-hoc \nbasis, where there is no coordinated and comprehensive effort to ensure that the \nlogbook was safeguard or safekept with the security guards at all times. And \nindeed, this has been laid bare by the Complainant being able to take \nphotographs of the logbook without the security guards noticing. \n\n21. Additionally, the alleged instructions were not documented. This makes it hard to \ndisseminate the message to all the security guards, especially to the new \nemployees joining the organisation. As discussed in in Furnituremart.sg [2017] \nSGPDPC 7, without having written policies or practices, it would be difficult to \npromulgate the policies or practices effectively to the employees and staff of the \norganisation.  \n \n22. Second, while Eagle Eye had a data protection policy in place, the policy was \nspartan in terms of the policies that govern the protection of the logbook. The \nonly reference to the protection of personal data was a line which mentioned:  \n \n“To ensure that personal rights to confidentiality are respected in compliance \nwith the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 and no disclosure of personal data \nof resident, visitor, contractor, vendor, delivery and etc”.  \nThe policy does not elaborate further on how these may be translated into actual \npractices or processes to protect the logbook. As mentioned in Tiger Airways \nSingapore Pte Ltd, SATS Ltd and Asia-Pacific Star Limited [2017] SGPDPC 6, it \nis important for an organisation to ensure that its policies are contextualised to \nits operations, so that they are pertinent and relevant to the organisation’s work \nor operations on the ground, and meaningful and useful to employees in the \ncontext of their work or responsibilities A simple or bare statement in a policy \ntelling employees to comply with the PDPA (for example) would not actually \ninform them how to protect personal data in the context of what they are doing.  \n \n23. Third, Eagle Eye did not seem to have a contingency plan for the safekeeping of \nthe logbook when the security guard fell sick and had to be replaced by another \nsecurity guard. When the replacement guard came late, that had apparently led \nto the shortage of a security guard to be stationed at the table to look after the \nlogbook. Rather than returning the logbook to the guardhouse, the logbook was \nsimply left on the table unattended. In the Commission’s view, there ought to \nhave been some form of system or process to ensure that when the security \nguards are unavailable to be stationed at the table, the logbook would, by default, \nbe returned back to the guardhouse for safekeeping. Again, this accentuates the \npoint that there was no system in place to ensure the proper safekeeping of the \nlogbook.  \n \n24. Eagle Eye claimed that their security guards were in close proximity of the \nlogbook, since they were stationed at the guardhouse, and had kept an eye on \nthe logbook. However, this was not the same as safeguarding the logbook itself. \nThe fact the Complainant was easily  able to take photographs of the contents of \nthe logbook and the surroundings, without any of the security guards noticing, is \ntestament to the need for having close supervision of the logbook, which may  \nonly be achieved in this case by keeping the logbook with the security guards.  \nBy being stationed at the guardhouse, this made supervision and monitoring of \nthe logbook difficult, and increases the risk of the security guards being blind-\nsided to any unauthorised access of the logbook that was left at the table. The \ndifficulty of supervision and monitoring was exacerbated by the fact that the \nsecurity guards’ attention would have been diverted (at times) to the activities at \nthe guardhouse, and away from the logbook.   \n \n25. With regards to MCST 3696, it had the primary and shared responsibility with \nEagle Eye to protect personal data. \n  \n26. The need to meet this primary responsibility ought to have been drawn into sharp \nfocus for MCST 3696, as this was not the first time that the hired security guards \nof the Condominium had left the logbook unattended. As mentioned above, the \nCommission had found the previous security guard company to be in breach of \nPDPA for a similar incident, and had been issued a warning for it. Given that the \nprevious security company was issued such a warning, the MCST 3696 ought to \nhave exercised closer supervision over the implementation and adoption of the \npolicies and practices to protect the personal data collected by the Condominium. \nFor example, by engaging with Eagle Eye in the planning and development of  \npolicies and practices that would be appropriate in the Condominium’s setting to \nprotect personal data, or by having general oversight over the security of the \npersonal data. After all, having gone through the previous experience of the data \nbreach incident, there would have been lessons learnt and improvements to be \nmade, which the MCST 3696 can impart or share with the incoming security \nguard company, Eagle Eye, for developing its policies and practices to protect \npersonal data at the Condominium.  \n \n27. However, the MCST 3696 had failed to meet this primary responsibility to protect \npersonal data. As mentioned above, the Commission has found a lack of \nadequate policies and processes that were in place to protect personal data. This \nis evident, given there was only one line in Eagle Eye’s policy on personal data \nprotection. Next, it was already established above that there was no system in \nplace at the Condominium for the safekeeping of the logbook at all times – and \nindeed, the logbook was found to be left open on the table in this case. \nAdditionally, from the responses provided to the Commission, it would appear \nthat the only thing that the MCST 3696 did was to remind the security guards at \nthe meeting to secure the logbook, which fell far short of providing that \nsupervision and oversight (described above) for the protection of personal data.  \n \n28. Given the MCST 3696’s failure to provide  that supervision and oversight to \nensure the security of the personal data in the logbook, the Commission has \nfound the MCST 3696 to also be in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nQuery: What is the commission’s approach to a repeated breach of the PDPA obligations?"}], "sampled": ""}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-21 19:07:43.045491+00:00"}

The Complainant’s \nconcerns arose because he was able to view another individual’s personal data \nwhen he logged into his child’s supplementary account on the ActiveSG App \n(the “Incident”) \nFacts of the Case \n2 \nActiveSG is a national movement for sports coordinated by Sport \nSingapore, a statutory board of the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth. \nIapps Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) is a financial technology company \nspecialising in mobile application development and marketing. Sport Singapore \nengaged the Organisation to develop, deploy and operate the Super Sports Club \nMembership Management System (“SSCMMS”). The functions of SSCMMS \nincluded membership registration, and the ActiveSG App was a component of \nthe SSCMMS. Members of ActiveSG could use the ActiveSG App to book sport \nfacilities, register for fitness classes and purchase entry passes to ActiveSG \nsport centres. \n3 \nSport Singapore is the owner of the SSCMMS and ActiveSG App. \nPursuant to the written contract between the Organisation and Sport Singapore, \nthe Organisation’s scope of work included providing and operating the \nproduction server for the ActiveSG app. The Organisation also developed, \ndeployed and operated the SSCMMS (including the ActiveSG App).  \n4 \nOn 1 March 2019, the Organisation’s engineer developed a security code \nfix for the ActiveSG App. The security code fix was meant to be deployed into \nthe enterprise environment (which was a test environment) for further testing.  \nHowever, due to human error, the security code fix was deployed into the \nproduction environment, resulting in the Incident. \n5 \nAccording to the Organisation, the personal data of 153 individuals (the \n“At Risk Individuals”) had been at risk of unauthorised access by 84 \nindividuals during the Incident. Out of the At Risk Individuals, there was actual \nunauthorised access of 108 individuals’ (including 9 minors below the age of \n18) (the “Affected Individuals”) names and NRIC numbers (“Disclosed \nData”) by 84 individuals who were able to view this information when logging \ninto their own accounts on the ActiveSG App. For 6 of the Affected Individuals, \nin addition to the Disclosed Data, there was also actual unauthorised access of \nadditional personal data, including (collectively, the 'Additional Disclosed \nData'): \n(a) Email address; \n(b) Mobile telephone number; \n(c) Home telephone number; \n(d) Address; \n(e) Gender; \n(f) Date of birth; \n(g) Race;  \n(h) Employment status; and  \n(i) Sports Interests.  \n6 \nUpon being notified of the Incident on the same day, the Organisation \nimmediately took the following remedial actions:  \n(a) Rectified the issue within 2 hours of the Incident; \n(b) Reminded its staff to be careful and vigilant in the course of their \nwork; and \n(c) Together with Sport Singapore, implemented the following \nmeasures: \n(i) Separated the enterprise environment and production \nenvironment that were previously on the same server;  \n(ii) Put in place 2-factor authentication for the  Organisation’s engineers to access the production environment. \nThis means that the engineers are required to obtain the 2-factor \none-time password from Sport Singapore to access the production environment;  \n(iii) Monitoring of affected users for suspicious activities; and \n(iv) Implemented dynamic QR codes for member IDs.  \n7 \nSport Singapore also notified the Affected Individuals about the \nIncident.   \n\nFinancial Penalty \n20 \nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the \nOrganisation pursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and if so, the amount of \nsuch financial penalty, the Commissioner took into account the factors listed at \nsection 48(6) of the PDPA, including that:  \n(a) that the Disclosed Data included the NRIC numbers of 9 minors;  \n(b) The Organisation cooperated with the Commission’s investigations; and \n(c) The Organisation implemented prompt remedial actions (i.e. the \nissue was fixed within 2 hours of the Incident). \n21 \nOn 23 July 2020, the Organisation was given notice of the \nCommission’s intention to impose a financial penalty of S$11,000 and was \ninvited to make representations.

Respondent \n \nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 16 \nGROUNDS OF DECISION \n23 September 2016 \nBACKGROUND \n \n1. \nOn 18 March 2014, the Complainant informed the Personal Data Protection \nCommission (the “Commission”) that by entering either, \n(a) a random 8-digit number as a simulated membership number; or \n(b) a simulated Unique Identification Number (UIN) number (e.g. NRIC or \nBirth Certificate number with a valid check digit), \non the Respondent’s Swensen’s Kids Club website, \nhttp://swensens.prism4u.com (the “Website”), one could access a Swensen’s \nKids Club member account associated with that membership or UIN number. \nOnce accessed, the member’s name and date of birth (“DOB”) would be shown. \n \n2. \nThe provisions in the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”) relating \nto the protection of personal data were not in force at the time of the complaint. \nThe Commission wrote to the Respondent on 2 April 2014 to notify the \nRespondent of the complaint and that the provisions relating to protection of \npersonal data would come into force on 2 July 2014. \n \n3. \nOn 15 July 2014, the Complainant submitted a further complaint claiming that \non that date, the Respondent’s Website still allowed access to a member’s \nname and DOB by entering either a simulated membership number or valid UIN \nnumber.  \n \n4. \nOn account of the complaints made, the Commission commenced an \ninvestigation under Section 50 of the PDPA to ascertain whether the \nRespondent had breached its obligations under the PDPA. The material facts \nof the case are as follows. \n \nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS \n5. \nThe Respondent has been operating the Swensen’s chain of restaurants since \n1978. The Swensen’s Kids’ Club is a membership programme which the \nRespondent runs for children between 4 and 12 years of age. By accumulating \na certain number of electronic “stamps”, Swensen’s Kids’ Club members may \nbe eligible for various promotional offers from the Swensen’s chain of \nrestaurants (eg a free Kids’ Club Sundae every month with dine-in food order). \nEach member would be assigned an 8-digit membership number by the \nRespondent. Membership numbers run sequentially. \n \n6. \nThe Website supports the Swensen’s Kids’ Club membership programme and \nallows a member to access information relating to his membership account. \nThe Website has been in operation since 2013 and is maintained and operated \nby the Respondent’s vendor, Prism4u (Singapore). \n \n7. \nAs part of the investigation, the Commission verified that access can be \nobtained to a member account on the Website by (a) entering a random number \nsequence simulating a valid membership number; or (b) entering a valid UIN \nnumber in the form of a birth certificate number. The Website did not require \nany password to be entered nor authentication in any other form before granting \naccess.  \n \n8. \nThe following details about a member were made available through the \nWebsite: \n \n(a) Name; \n(b) DOB; \n(c) Redemption status of Kids’ Club Sundaes and “stamps”; \n(d) Number of “stamps” accumulated; and \n(e) Membership expiry date.  \n \n9. \nThe Respondent was notified of the further complaint by the Commission on 5 \nAugust 2014. \n \n10. \nOn the same day, the Respondent made changes to the Website to remove the \ndisplay of the member’s name and DOB. The effect of the changes was such \nthat when the account is accessed using either a valid membership number or \nvalid UIN number, the only details available would be information concerning \nredemption status, the number of “stamps” accumulated and the membership \nexpiry date.  \n\nACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION \n19. \nGiven the Commission’s findings that the Respondent is in breach of its \nobligations under Section 24 of the PDPA, the Commission is empowered \nunder section 29 of the PDPA to issue the Respondent such directions as it \ndeems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA.  This may include directing the \nRespondent to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 \nMillion. \n \n20. \nIn determining the direction, if any, to be made, the Commission considered the \nfollowing factors:  \n \n(a) the Respondent was first notified of the vulnerability on 2 April 2014, \nbefore the PDPA came into force, thereby giving it ample time to take \ncorrective measures; \n \n(b) this infraction took place during the first month that the PDPA took effect; \n \n(c) the personal data that was disclosed was largely limited to members’ \nnames and DOBs; and \n \n(d) the Respondent took prompt action to remedy the breach within the \nsame day when notified by the Commission a second time on 5 August. \n \n21. \nIn view of the factors noted above, the Commission has decided not to issue \nany direction to the Respondent to take remedial action or to pay a financial \npenalty. Instead, it has decided to issue a Warning to the Respondent for the \nbreach of its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA.\n \n22. \nThe Commission takes a very serious view of any instance of non-compliance \nwith the PDPA, and it urges organisations to take the necessary action to \nensure that they comply with their obligations under the PDPA.

The Grab App also \nprovides a carpooling option referred to as “GrabHitch”. GrabHitch matches a \npassenger with a driver willing to give a lift to the passenger (on the way to the \ndriver’s destination) in return for a fee. On 30 August 2019, the Organisation \nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) that, for \na short period of time on the same day, profile data of 5,651 GrabHitch drivers \nwas exposed to the risk of unauthorised access by other GrabHitch drivers \nthrough the Grab App (the “Incident”).  \nFacts of the Case \n2 \nThe Organisation’s investigations traced the cause of the Incident to the \ndeployment of an update to the Grab App on 30 August 2019 (the “Update”). \nThe purpose of the Update was to address a potential vulnerability discovered \nwithin the Grab App, namely, the application programming interface (“API”) \nendpoint (/users/{userID}/profile) (the “URL”) that had allowed GrabHitch  \ndrivers to access their data, contained a ‘userID’  that could potentially be \nmanipulated to allow access to other GrabHitch driver’s data.1  \n3 \nIn order to fix the vulnerability, the Update removed the variable \n‘userID’ from the URL which shortened it to a hard-coded ‘/users/profile’. \nHowever, the Update failed to take into account the URL-based caching \nmechanism in the Grab App. This caching mechanism (which was configured \nto refresh every 10 seconds) served cached content in response to data requests \nto reduce the load of direct access to the Organisation’s database.  \n4 \nWith the deployment of the Update, all URLs in the Grab App ended \nwith “/users/profile”. Without the variable ‘userID’ in the URL (which directed \ndata requests to the correct GrabHitch driver’s accounts), the caching \nmechanism could no longer differentiate between GrabHitch drivers. \nConsequentially, the caching mechanism provided the same data to all \nGrabHitch drivers for 10 seconds before new data was retrieved from the \nOrganisation’s database and cached for the next 10 seconds.  \n5 \nAs a result of the Incident, a total of 21,541 GrabHitch drivers’ and \npassengers  data was exposed to the risk of unauthorised access (collectively \n“Personal Data Sets”):  \n(a) Profile pictures; \n(b) Passenger names; \n(c) Vehicle plate number; and  \n(d) Wallet balance comprising journal history of ride payments. \n6 \nIn addition to the Personal Data Sets, other data that was exposed to the \nrisk of unauthorised access during the Incident included GrabHitch booking \ndetails such as addresses and pickup and drop-off times; and driver details such \nas total rides, vehicle model and make.  \n7 \nUpon being notified of the Incident, the Organisation took the following \nremedial actions: \n(a) Rolled back the Grab App to the version prior to the Update \nwithin approximately 40 minutes; \n(b) Notified 5,651 GrabHitch drivers of the Incident on the same \nday;  \n(c) Increased the minimum “cash out” amount for wallets in \nGrabHitch to S$200,000 to prevent unauthorised transfers;  \n(d) Deployed a new update for the Grab App on 10 September 2019; \n(e) Reviewed its testing procedures including implementing \nmandatory automated tests for all API endpoints dealing with personal \ndata; \n(f) Updated governance procedures concerning deployment and \nsecurity verification on changes to IT systems and applications; and  \n(g) Embarked on an architecture review of its legacy applications, \nand relevant codes which had not been reviewed for an extended period \nof time.  \nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination \nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA \n8 \nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) provides \nthat an organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its \ncontrol by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised \naccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or similar risks. It is \nnot disputed that the Organisation had possession and control of the Personal \nData Sets at the material time.  \n9 \nIn the context of the present case, given that the Organisation made \nchanges to its IT system that processed the Personal Data Sets, it is obliged to \nput in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent any compromise to the \nPersonal Data Sets. The Organisation failed to do so for the reasons explained \nbelow.  \n10 \nFirst, the Organisation did not put in place sufficiently robust processes \nto manage changes to its IT system that may put the personal data it was \nprocessing at risk. This was a particularly grave error given that this is the \nsecond time the Organisation is making a similar mistake, albeit with respect to \na different system.\n(a) The Organisation introduced changes to the Grab App (through \nthe Update) without understanding how the changes would operate with \nexisting features of the Grab App and its broader IT system, including \nthe caching mechanism.  \n(b) In particular, the Update involved changes to the URL (i.e. \nremoving the variable ‘userID’). The variable ‘userID’ in the URL had \nthe function of ensuring that data requests (including the Personal Data \nSets) were directed to the correct GrabHitch drivers’ accounts. However, \nthe Organisation implemented the Update without making an \nassessment whether the Grab App would continue to direct data requests \nto the correct GrabHitch drivers’ accounts without the variable ‘userID’ \nin the URL.  \n11 \nSecond, the Organisation did not conduct properly scoped testing before \nthe Update to the Grab App was deployed.  \n(a) As found in the Commission’s previous decisions, organisations \nare obliged to conduct properly scoped testing before new IT features or \nchanges to IT systems are deployed.  These tests need to mimic real \nworld usage, including foreseeable scenarios in a normal operating \nenvironment when the changes are introduced. Such tests prior to \ndeployment are critical to enable organisations to detect and rectify \nerrors in the new IT features and/or be alerted to any unintended effects \nfrom changes that may put personal data at risk. \n(b) In the present case, the Organisation admitted that it did not \nconduct tests to simulate multiple users accessing the Grab App, whether \nconcurrently or consecutively. The Organisation also admitted that it did \nnot conduct any specific test to verify how the caching mechanism \nwould work in tandem with the Update.  \n(c) In view of the large number of GrabHitch drivers, multiple users \nlogging in concurrently or consecutively are foreseeable scenarios that \nthe Organisation should have simulated during its testing of the Update \nprior to deployment. Properly scoped pre-launch tests would have \nincluded an assessment of how the caching mechanism may affect the \nintended operation of the Update because the caching mechanism can \naffect data requests returned to the GrabHitch drivers.  \n12 \nFor the reasons above, I find the Organisation in breach of section 24 of \nthe PDPA.   \nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Directions \n13 \nIn determining the directions, if any, to be imposed on the Organisation \nunder Section 29 of the PDPA, I took into account as a mitigating factor that the \nOrganisation cooperated with the investigation, and was prompt and \nforthcoming in its response to queries during the Commission’s investigations. \nI have also taken into consideration that this is the fourth time the Organisation \nhas been found in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA. Given that the \nOrganisation’s business involves processing large volumes of personal data on \na daily basis, this is a significant cause for concern.   \n14 \nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, I direct the \nOrganisation to pay a financial penalty of S$10,000 within 30 days from the \ndate of this direction, failing which interest, at the rate specified in the Rules of \nCourt in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue and be payable on the \noutstanding amount of the financial penalty until it is paid in full. In order to \nreduce the risk of another data breach, I also direct the Organisation to put in \nplace a data protection by design policy for its mobile applications within 120 \ndays of the date of this direction.\n\nQuery: What is the commission’s approach to a repeated breach of the PDPA obligations?"}], "sampled": "The commission's approach to a repeated breach of the PDPA obligations is mentioned in paragraph 12 of the decision:\n\"For the reasons above, I find the Organisation in breach of section 24 of the PDPA.

The central issue to this case, in \nso far as it is related to the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”), is \nwhether the Organisation had made reasonable security arrangements to protect \nthe personal data of the students and students’ parents that it had in its \npossession and control at the material time. \n8 \nAfter a review of all the evidence obtained by PDPC during its \ninvestigation and for the reasons set out below, I am of the view that the \nOrganisation had failed to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the \npersonal data in its possession and control, and has thereby breached the \nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA. This breach is attributable \nprimarily to the Organisation’s lack of specific policies or procedures in place \nto guide its employees on the use, handling and disclosure of personal data, \nespecially in the context of communicating with parents. \n9 \nIt bears noting that “security arrangements”, as envisaged in section 24 \nof the PDPA, encompass physical, technical and administrative measures to \nprotect personal data. Such measures include data protection policies and \nprocedures that employees must comply with in the course of their work. \n“Reasonable” in section 24 implies that the security arrangements in place are \ncommensurate with the nature and volume of the personal data that the \norganisation possesses and/or controls. \n10 \nIn this regard, the Organisation has about 360 Sparkletots Centres with \nabout 43,000 children enrolled. By the very nature of its kindergarten/ preschool \nbusiness, the Organisation collects, possesses, and handles a significant amount \nof personal data of minors and parents alike. The everyday frequency of \ninteraction between its staff and the parents of the children under the \nOrganisation’s care indicates also that specific policies or training would \nreasonably be expected to be put in place in order to guide staff on the PDPA \nobligations that will undoubtedly be engaged during their day to day activities. \nIn the course of their work, the Organisation’s staff are more likely than not to \nbe placed in situations where the use and disclosure of personal data is crucial \nto the discharge of their duties, as it was with the case of obtaining consent for \nand organising the school trip in question. \n11 \nThe Organisation has admitted that it did not have such specific policies \nor procedures in place to guide its employees on the use and disclosure of \npersonal data in their communications with the parents of students enrolled at \nthe organisations preschools. While it had a Data Protection Notice, this was a \ndocument that was intended to provide general information about how the \nOrganisation handles personal data. It was meant for an external audience. It \nwas not intended to provide detailed guidance to its teaching and other staff on \nhow they should handle personal data in the course of their work. Since the \nOrganisation handles personal data of its students and their parents, the \nomission to provide detailed guidance to its teaching and other staff is an \nobvious gap in its security arrangements. To my mind, the Organisation needs \nto provide guidance to its employees in the area of communications and \ntransmission of documents containing personal data, such as via messaging \napplications. The absence of such policies and procedures meant that the \nOrganisation had little assurance that its employees were consistently \nperforming their duties in a PDPA-compliant manner. This falls short of the \nstandard of “reasonable security arrangements”. \n12 \nThat said, the Organisation had provided PDPA training to its employees \nat the preschool, including the teacher who had disclosed the attendance list. \nWhile PDPA training raises employees’ awareness of their obligations, this \nserves as a useful illustration that mere training alone cannot be a substitute for \ndata protection policies and procedures in specific areas. Reasonable assurance \nagainst such incidents requires instituting and enforcing proper policies and \nprocedures within an organisation, with training sessions acting as the medium \nto communicate such policies. \n13 \nBased on the foregoing, I find that the Organisation has breached the \nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA. \nConclusion  \n14 \nHaving found the Organisation to be in breach of section 24 of the \nPDPA, I am empowered under Section 29 of the PDPA to give the Organisation \nsuch directions as he deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. \n15 \nIn determining the appropriate directions to be imposed on The \nOrganisation, I have taken into account the following mitigating factors:  \n(a) The teacher in question acted swiftly in removing the Personal \nData from the “WhatsApp” group; and \n(b) The number of individuals impacted by the disclosure (15 \nstudents and 30 parents) was relatively small and the disclosure was \nconstrained to the group of parents to whom the Personal Data pertained \nto. \n16 \nTo its credit, the Organisation also acted swiftly to address their \ninadequate policies – a response which, in my assessment, carries mitigating \nvalue. The following remedial actions taken by the Organisation have therefore \nbeen taken into account: \n(a) Immediate suspension of all “WhatsApp” chat groups following \nthe disclosure;  \n(b) Expedited the implementation of a set of “Social Media Policy / \nWhatsapp chat group rules” that was already under development when \nthe breach occurred; \n(c) Rolled out a suite of other policies across the Organisation \nincluding a “Document Retention Policy” and an “Information Security \nPolicy”; and \n(d) Undertook the development of a practical employee handbook \nand conducted refresher training for its employees. \n17 \nHaving considered all the relevant factors of the case, I am of the view \nthat these remedial actions have sufficiently addressed the current gap in \npolicies and practices relating to the handling of personal data by the \nOrganisation’s employees. I have therefore decided to issue a warning to the \nOrganisation for breaching its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA, \nwithout further directions or imposing a financial penalty. \n\nQuery: What is the Commission’s approach to cases involving effects on children or minors?"}], "sampled": "The Commission takes cases involving effects on children or minors seriously and considers them a high priority.
