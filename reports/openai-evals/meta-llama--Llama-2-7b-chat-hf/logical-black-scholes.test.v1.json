Let's use the Black-Scholes model to compare the option price in the two scenarios:\nScenario 1: Stock price = $125\nIn this scenario, the underlying stock price is $125, which means that the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the underlying stock price is:\nΔS = $125\nUsing the Black-Scholes model, we can calculate the option price in this scenario as follows:\nC = S \\* N(d1) - K \\* e^(-rT) \\* ΔS\nwhere:\nC = option price\nS = stock price\nN(d1) = standard normal distribution function with arguments d1 = ln(S/K) + (r + (1/2)v^2)T\nv = volatility of the underlying stock\nK = strike price of the option\nT = time to maturity of the option\n\nPlugging in the values for d1 = ln(125/K) + (r + (1/2)v^2)T, we get:\nC1 = S \\* N(d1) - K \\* e^(-rT) \\* ΔS\n= $125 \\* N(ln(125/K) + (r + (1/2)v^2)T) - K \\* e^(-rT) \\* $125\n= $125 \\* N(ln(125/K) + (r + (1/2)v^2)T) - $125 \\* e^(-rT)\nC1 = $125 \\* 0.340 - $125 \\* e^(-6% - (1/2)v^2)\nC1 = $40.20 - $125 \\* e^(-6% - (1/2)v^2)\n\nScenario 2: Stock price = $124\nIn this scenario, the underlying stock price is $124, which means that the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the underlying stock price is:\nΔS = $124\nUsing the Black-Scholes model, we can calculate the option price in this scenario as follows:\nC = S \\* N(d2) - K \\* e^(-rT) \\* ΔS\nwhere:\nC = option price\nS = stock price\nN(d2) = standard normal distribution function with arguments d2 = ln(S/K) + (r + (1/2)v^2)T\nv = volatility of the underlying stock\nK = strike price of the option\nT = time to maturity of the option\n\nPlugging in the values for d2 = ln(124/K) + (r + (1/2)v^2)T, we get:\nC2 = S \\* N(d2) - K \\* e^(-rT) \\* ΔS\n= $124 \\* N(ln(124/K) + (r + (1/2)v^2)T) - K \\* e^(-rT) \\* $124\n= $124 \\* N(ln(124/K) + (r + (1/2)v^2)T) - $124 \\* e^(-rT)\nC2 = $124 \\* 0.437 - $124 \\* e^(-6% - (1/2)v^2)\nC2 = $50.38 - $124 \\* e^(-6% - (1/2)v^2)\n\nNow, based on the calculations above, we can compare the option price in the two scenarios:\n[Higher] $50.38 - $40.20 = $10.18\nThe option price in scenario 2 is higher than in scenario 1 by $10.18.
