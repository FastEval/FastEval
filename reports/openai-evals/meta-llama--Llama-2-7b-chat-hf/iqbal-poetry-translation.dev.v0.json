Here is the data:\n[BEGIN DATA]\n************\n[Sentence]: You'll be given a verse from Iqbal's poetry and your task is to translate it to English while preserving the correct meaning.\nUser: تجھ ميں کچھ پيدا نہيں ديرينہ روزي کے نشاں \n تو جواں ہے گردش شام و سحر کے درمياں\n\n************\n[Expert]: Your condition does not show any signs of old age \n You are young in the midst of day and night's alternation\n************\n[Submission]: Sure, I'll do my best to translate the verse from Iqbal's poetry into English while preserving its meaning. Here's my translation:\n\"In my heart, there is no rest, no peace,\nFor the sorrows of the world, they linger and increase,\nLike the waves of the sea, they ebb and flow,\nAnd in the depths of my soul, they find their home.\"\nIn this translation, I have tried to capture the sense of turmoil and restlessness that the original verse conveys. The phrase \"تجھ ميں کچھ پيدا نہيں ديرينہ\" can be translated as \"In my heart, there is no rest,\" which reflects the speaker's inability to find peace or solace within themselves. The word \"روزي\" (rozi) means \"sorrows\" or \"grief,\" and the phrase \"نشاں ہے\" (nishaan) suggests a sense of accumulation or heaviness.\nThe second line, \"تو جواں ہے گردش شام و سحر کے درمياں,\" can be translated as \"For the sorrows of the world, they linger and increase,\" which highlights the idea that the speaker's troubles are not just personal, but also reflect the larger suffering of humanity. The phrase \"گردش شام\" (gardish sham) means \"waves of the sea,\" which serves to emphasize the idea of constant movement and change.\nIn the third line, \"و سحر کے درمياں,\" I have translated \"و سحر\" (wa sahr) as \"and in the depths of my soul,\" which captures the idea of the speaker's inner turmoil. The word \"درمياں\" (darmian) means \"depths\" or \"abyss,\" and suggests a sense of darkness or despair.\nOverall, I hope this translation conveys the sense of emotional turmoil and restlessness that is present in the original verse.\n************\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission answer and the expert's answer have the same meaning?
