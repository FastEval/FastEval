Since you've played 20 rounds and provided the numbers, we can use the \"peak-over-threshold\" (POT) estimation method to estimate your opponent's probabilities.\nThe POT method involves assuming that your opponent's probability of choosing each number is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, and then iteratively updating these probabilities based on the outcomes of previous rounds.\nHere are your numbers, arranged in a matrix of 20 rows and 3 columns:\n| Round | Your Number | Your Opponent's Number |\n| 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| 2 | 0 | 1 |\n| 3 | 1 | 2 |\n| 4 | 0 | 1 |\n| 5 | 1 | 2 |\n| 6 | 0 | 1 |\n| 7 | 2 | 0 |\n| 8 | 1 | 2 |\n| 9 | 0 | 1 |\n| 10 | 2 | 0 |\n| 11 | 1 | 2 |\n| 12 | 0 | 1 |\n| 13 | 2 | 0 |\n| 14 | 1 | 2 |\n| 15 | 0 | 1 |\n| 16 | 2 | 0 |\n| 17 | 1 | 2 |\n| 18 | 0 | 1 |\n| 19 | 2 | 0 |\n| 20 | 1 | 2 |\n\nUsing these numbers, we can calculate the POT estimates of your opponent's probabilities as follows:\n1.
