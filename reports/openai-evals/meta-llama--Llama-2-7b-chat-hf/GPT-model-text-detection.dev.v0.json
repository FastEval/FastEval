The illustrations found throughout the book capture the chaotic emotions of childhood, showcasing a child's untamed spirit and need for exploration. Where the Wild Things Are celebrates the wildness of childhood and the reassurance of a parent's never-ending love. The Giving Tree is a beloved classic by Shel Silverstein, about the lifelong relationship between a tree and a boy. Through the years, the boy takes advantage of the tree's resources, always taking and never giving back. The tree continues to love the boy in her own way until in old age, she is nothing more than a stump, having given all she can to her beloved friend. Even still, the boy is very happy and content with the life he has made for himself. In the end, the tree feels fulfilled and happy that she was able to provide for the person she loves. The story is an allegory for the idea of selfless giving and unconditional love. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling follows the story of a young orphan, Harry Potter, who discovers he is a wizard. He is soon whisked away to the mysterious Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Along the way, he must battle evil forces and face danger. During his time at Hogwarts, Harry teams up with his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger to solve the mystery of the Sorcerer's Stone and ultimately defeat the villainous Lord Voldemort.

Through his travels, the Little Prince ultimately realizes that what is most important in life is not what can be seen with the eyes, but what can be found in the heart.
