The code consists of four integers (a, b, c, and d) such that the knot is represented as (a, b, c, d) = (reader's convention).\n\nTo determine the unknotting number of a knot using the Dowker-Thistlethwaite code, we substitute the crossings of the knot into the formula:\n\nunknotting number = a + (b^2 - 4c) / (2d).\n\nNow, let's apply this formula to the given knots:\n\n1. 6: a = 1, b = 2, c = 0, d = 1. Unknotting number = 1 + (2^2 - 4(0)) / (2(1)) = 1 + 4 / 2 = 3.\n2. 12: a = 2, b = 3, c = 0, d = 1. Unknotting number = 2 + (3^2 - 4(0)) / (2(1)) = 2 + 9 / 2 = 5.\n3. 14: a = 3, b = 4, c = 0, d = 1. Unknotting number = 3 + (4^2 - 4(0)) / (2(1)) = 3 + 16 / 2 = 5.\n4. 18: a = 4, b = 5, c = 0, d = 1. Unknotting number = 4 + (5^2 - 4(0)) / (2(1)) = 4 + 25 / 2 = 7.\n5. 20: a = 5, b = 6, c = 0, d = 1. Unknotting number = 5 + (6^2 - 4(0)) / (2(1)) = 5 + 36 / 2 = 7.\n6. 2: a = 1, b = 1, c = 0, d = 1. Unknotting number = 1 + (1^2 - 4(0)) / (2(1)) = 1 + 1 / 2 = 1.\n7. 4: a = 2, b = 2, c = 0, d = 1. Unknotting number = 2 + (2^2 - 4(0)) / (2(1)) = 2 + 4 / 2 = 3.\n8. 22: a = 3, b = 5, c = 0, d = 1. Unknotting number = 3 + (5^2 - 4(0)) / (2(1)) = 3 + 25 / 2 = 6.\n9. 10: a = 3, b = 4, c = 0, d = 2. Unknotting number = 3 + (4^2 - 4(0)) / (2(2)) = 3 + 16 / 4 = 5.\n10. 8: a = 2, b = 3, c = 0, d = 1. Unknotting number = 2 + (3^2 - 4(0)) / (2(1)) = 2 + 9 / 2 = 5.\n11. 16: a = 4, b = 6, c = 0, d = 2. Unknotting number = 4 + (6^2 - 4(0)) / (2(2)) = 4 + 36 / 4 = 7.\n\nTherefore, the unknotting number of each of the given knots is:\n\n1. 6: 3\n2. 12: 5\n3. 14: 5\n4. 18: 7\n5. 20: 7\n6. 2: 3\n7.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Determine the unknotting number of the knot, represented in Dowker-Thistlethwaite code.
