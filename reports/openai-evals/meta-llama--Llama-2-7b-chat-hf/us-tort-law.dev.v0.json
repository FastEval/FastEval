The plant burns lignite, a low-grade fuel which is available in large quantities. Although the plant was constructed in accordance with the best practicable technology, the plant emits a substantial quantity of invisible fumes. The only way the utility company can reduce the fumes is by the use of scrubbing equipment that would cost $50,000,000 to install and would increase the retail price of generated electricity by 50 percent while reducing the volume of fumes by only 20 percent. Because of the expense of such equipment and its relative ineffectiveness, no other generating plants burning lignite use such equipment. The plant was located in a sparsely settled rural area, remote from the large city served by the utility company. A farmer owned a farm adjacent to the plant. He had farmed the land for 40 years and lived on the premises. The prevailing winds carried fumes from the new plant over the farmer's land. His 2006 crop was less than half the average size of this crop over the five years immediately preceding the construction of the plant. It can be established that the fumes caused the crop reduction. The farmer's hay fever, from which he had long suffered, became worse in 2006.

The only way the utility company can reduce the fumes is by the use of scrubbing equipment that would cost $50,000,000 to install and would increase the retail price of generated electricity by 50% while reducing the volume of fumes by only 20%. Because of the expense of such equipment and its relative ineffectiveness, no other generating plants burning lignite use such equipment.

After the consulting radiologist told the doctor that the X-rays looked normal, the doctor told the patient that he was in good health. In fact, the radiologist had missed signs of cancer on the X-rays that a trained radiologist, acting competently, would have detected. After another X-ray of the patient's chest, performed one year later, showed advanced lung cancer, the doctor discovered that the radiologist had misinterpreted the patient's earlier X-rays. The patient died within four months of the later X-ray, because by then his cancer had become untreatable. In a wrongful death suit against the radiologist based on only the facts set out above, a jury found the radiologist negligent and awarded $3 million in compensatory damages and $21 million in punitive damages. Is the radiologist likely to have the punitive damages award vacated on appeal?\nA. No, because a 7 to 1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is constitutionally permissible.\nB. No, because an award of punitive damages is appropriate for medical malpractice that results in death or serious injury.\nC. Yes, because punitive damages awards are not authorized unless there is proof of willful or wanton misconduct on the defendant's part.\nD.

The bill collector showed up at the purchaser's house at 7 p. m. on a summer evening while many of the purchaser's neighbors were seated on their porches. When the purchaser opened the door, the bill collector, who was standing just outside the door, raised an electrically amplified bullhorn to his mouth. In a voice that could be heard a block away, the bill collector called the purchaser a \"deadbeat\" and asked him when he intended to pay his bill to the store. The purchaser, greatly angered, slammed the door shut knowing it would strike the bullhorn. The door struck the bullhorn and jammed it forcibly against the bill collector's face. As a consequence, the bill collector lost some of his front teeth. If the bill collector asserts a claim of battery against the purchaser will the bill collector prevail?\nA.

The pedestrian was in a hurry, and so before reaching the north curb on the street, she cut to her left diagonally across the street to the east-west crosswalk and started across it. Just after reaching the east-west crosswalk, the traffic light turned green in her favor. She proceeded about five steps further across the street to the west in the crosswalk when she was struck by a car approaching from her right that she thought would stop, but did not. The car was driven by a driver, 81 years of age, who failed to stop his car after seeing that the traffic light was red against him.

The painting had been purchased by the pedestrian's grandmother for $750 but was valued at $500,000 at the time of the accident. The pedestrian has filed suit against the driver.

Thinking the experience would be good for her, the woman recommended her daughter to a parent as a babysitter for his five-year-old child but did not mention her daughter's difficulties or her lack of prior experience as a babysitter. The woman and the parents were longstanding social acquaintances. On the evening the daughter was to babysit, the parents told the daughter that she should treat their child firmly, but that it would be preferable not to spank him since he did not take kindly to it. They did not tell the daughter they had experienced trouble retaining babysitters because of their child's temper tantrums. Later in the evening when the child became angry upon being told to go to his room for being naughty, the daughter spanked him, but only moderately hard. The child then threw a hardcover book at the daughter, hitting her in the eye. As the daughter tried to catch the child to take him to his room, the child fled around the house and out the back door, knocking over and breaking an expensive lamp. The backyard was completely dark. The daughter heard the child screaming and banging at the back door, which had closed and locked automatically, but she did nothing. After 20 minutes had passed, she heard a banging and crying at the front door, but still she did nothing. Then the noise stopped. After a few minutes, the daughter went outside and found the child lying on the steps unconscious and injured. If a claim is asserted on behalf of the child against the woman for damages based on her daughter's conduct, the woman will probably be liable, because\nA. parents are vicariously liable for the intentional torts of their children.\nB. she has a nondelegable duty to control the actions of her child.\nC. respondeat superior applies.\nD. she was negligent.\nAnswer:"}], "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-21 20:12:50.608257+00:00"}

Despite the plaintiff's care, the original finish of the cabinet was irreparably damaged. When finally refinished, the cabinet was worth less than 20% of what it would have been worth if the original finish had been preserved. No other removal technique could have preserved the original finish. If the plaintiff sues the manufacturer to recover the loss he has suffered as a result of the destruction of the cabinet's original finish, will the plaintiff prevail?\nA. Yes, because no other known removal technique would have preserved the original finish.\nB. Yes, because the loss would not have occurred had the statement in the brochure been true.\nC. No, because the product was not defective when sold by the manufacturer.\nD. No, because the product was not dangerous to persons.\nAnswer:"}], "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-21 20:13:34.117983+00:00"}

Intentional infliction of emotional distress.\nExplanation:\nThe man in this scenario has suffered a significant emotional distress as a result of the neighbor's actions, which is a recognizable injury in tort law. The neighbor's intentional killing of the man's beloved cat, which was a valuable and sentimental item, was a deliberate and malicious act that caused the man significant emotional harm. This could be considered as a form of intentional infliction of emotional distress, which is a valid claim in tort law.\nThe other options are not as likely to result in a significant monetary recovery:\nA. Battery: While the neighbor's actions may have caused physical harm to the cat, it is unlikely that the man would have a claim for battery against the neighbor. Battery requires actual physical contact, and it is unlikely that the neighbor's actions would be considered as a form of battery.\nC. Trespass to a chattel: While the cat did trespass on the neighbor's property, this is not a sufficient basis for a claim in trespass to a chattel. The man's claim is based on the neighbor's intentional killing of the cat, rather than the cat's trespassing.\nD. Conversion: Conversion is a claim for the unauthorized use or disposal of another person's property. While the neighbor's actions may have resulted in the loss of the man's property (the cat), this is not a sufficient basis for a claim in conversion.
