Since the vertices lie on a sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to each vertex is equal, call it d.\nThe volume of the sphere is (4/3) \\* pi \\* d^3, where d is the radius.\nSince the pyramid has a volume of 54, the volume of the sphere is 54 / (4/3) \\* pi, or 54 / pi.\nNow, we need to find m + n, where m and n are the numbers that satisfy the condition.\nLet's assume m + n = x, where x is an integer.\nSince m and n are relatively prime, we can factor them as m = a and n = b, where a and b are integers and not both zero.\nThen, we have m + n = (a + b) = x.\nNow, we have a system of linear equations:\na + b = x\na = x - b\n\nSolving this system, we get:\na = x - b\nb = x - a\n\nNow, we have two equations and two variables.
