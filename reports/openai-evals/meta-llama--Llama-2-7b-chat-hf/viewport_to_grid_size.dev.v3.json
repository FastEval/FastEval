Since G has the same number of rows as columns, we can use the same reasoning as in the previous problem to find the number of cells in G.\nIn the viewport, the cell with index 1 is located in the top-left corner and may not be visible. Therefore, the first row of the viewport contains 10 cells, and the first column contains 10 cells. The remaining cells in the viewport are numbered consecutively from left to right and from top to bottom, without any gaps.\nUsing the same reasoning as in the previous problem, we can conclude that the number of cells in G is 33 * 11 = 353."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-21 19:06:21.854612+00:00"}
