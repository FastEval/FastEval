Here's how I arrived at that answer:\nIn the Blackfoot language, the cardinal numerals are represented by words that are constructed using a specific pattern of prefixes, suffixes, and root words. The prefix \"ihk-\" indicates that the number is greater than 100, while the suffix \"-itsika\" indicates that the number is a multiple of 20.\nSo, to convert \"ihkitsika\" to its numerical value, we need to determine the amount of times the prefix \"ihk-\" and the suffix \"-itsika\" are repeated in the word.\nUsing the pattern of the Blackfoot language, we can see that \"ihkitsika\" has 3 prefixes (ihk-ihk-ihk) and 2 suffixes (-itsika-itsika), for a total of 5 repetitions of the prefix and suffix.\nUsing the numerical value of each repetition, we can calculate the total numerical value of \"ihkitsika\" as follows:\n* Prefix \"ihk-\": 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000\n* Suffix \"-itsika\": 2 x 20 x 20 = 800\n* Total value: 1000 + 800 = 1800\nTherefore, the numerical value of \"ihkitsika\" is 1800.\nSo, my answer to the question is [1800]."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-21 20:03:04.119948+00:00"}
