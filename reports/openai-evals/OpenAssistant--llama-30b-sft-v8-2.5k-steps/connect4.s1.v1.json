Created by Martin Cooper in 1973, the technology is the wireless network to which cell phones connect, by detecting and connecting to it using radio waves transmitted among antennas of cell sites, the base stations of these cells,.[1]\n\nIn addition to telephony, 2010s-era mobile phones support a variety of other services, such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet browsing, Morris code, over-the-radio streaming (FM radio, voice (SSB), television (DVB-H and ISDB), navigation (GPS), andcks, and heart rate monitors. In the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly accelerated number portability, enabling app-to-phone text-based symmetrical encryption for non- controllers.[a]\n\nIn 2023, it is estimated there were 7 billion smartphones in active use, of which the top brands are Samsung and Apple, with Chinese brands Huawei, Xiaomi, and Oppo coming in as top of the global mobile market dataanalytics. Business finance expertugh that as of 2024, 96% of the world's population over the age of 16 had access to cell phones. As of 2028, new South Korean smartphones and some wearable hardware have been made more with holographic displays through holographic flexible OLED.[b] The first commercially available device that could connect to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) was the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X, and it took over ten years for the next generation, 1G (analog cellular), to be introduced. 2G, introduced in 1991, (an all-digit system), allowed it to have much longer conversations and transfer data services, and added text messaging. In the late 1990s, two digital technologies, iDEN and CDMA, and later GSM, TDMA, UMTS and EDGE were implemented, with GPRS and later 3G technologies that brought text messaging and mobile Internet access. It also brought Internet users within the universal emergency number service.\n\nIn 2003, Ericsson showed off a prototype for video calls using slow 3G UMTS technology. Mobile payments were ushered in by Apple Inc. and Google with Android in 2011 with SIM-based and carrier-based mobile payment systems.GSM is the most ubiquitous standard for cell phones, as of 2022[update] it is commercially available in over 180 countries. It was developed by and is operated by a consortium known as the GSM Association. As of 2022, the GSM Association counted 3300 million GSM phone subscribers, representing 80% of mobile call users, and a total of 5.1 billion mobile subscribers including other technologies such as UMTS/3G and LTE/4G.\n\nA cell phone has a cellularidentifier (sometimes called a mobile subscriber characteristic (MSISDN) number) assign a phone to a carrier's network.\n\nIn 2007, the Doomsday Clock of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists advanced from five minutes to midnight (minutes to the imagined catastrophe of midnight, or nuclear holocaust) to four minutes twenty-three seconds, largely because of an increased likelihood of catastrophe following the development of small nuclear weapons and regional nuclear proliferation and in light of a crumbling detente between the U.S. and Russia.
