Here's the solution:\n\n6x - 2 = 3 + 5x\nSecond-grade students can solve this equation by using the inverse operation skill, where they undo the addition and multiplication to isolate the variable. However, the equation has a degree of 2, so it needs to be factored before isolating the variable. Here's the steps with explanations:\n\n1. Divide both sides by -2 to isolate the left side.\n\n6x - 2 / -2 = 3 + 5x / -2\n\nThis step doesn't change the equation but simplifies it.\n\n1. Factor the left side.\n\n6x - 2 = -2(3 + 5x)\n\nNote that the equation is still correct if we factor the -2 out, as they invert when the equation is solved.\n\n1. Distribute the factor (in this case, -2) over all terms on the left side to have the terms multiples of each other when they are subtracted.\n\n6x - 2 = -2(3) - 2(5x)\n\nSimplifying this step, we can write the equation as:\n\n6x - 2 = -6 - 10x\n\nThe left side can be simplified by combining the constants, but it's not needed for what follows.\n\n1. Add 6 to both sides of the equation.\n\n6x - 2 + 6 = -6 + 10x - 6 + 6\n\nHere's another way of looking at that step by reducing it to similar terms:\n\n6x - 2 + 6 = -6 + 10x\n2. Factor out 3 on the right side.\n\n3(2x - 1) = 3(3)\n\nRemember that the division by 3 will not change the equation as it inverts with multiplication.\n\n3. Fully factor the right side.\n\n3(2x - 1) = 3(3)\n\nThis step helps identify a common factor that can be eliminate from the equation.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Solve the following question for x.
