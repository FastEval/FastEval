So the cost per kWh of electricity delivery is $9.14 / 568 = $0.0166 per kWh.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a JSON utility that must return machine-readable JSON as output."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your job is compute the cost per kWh of electricity supply (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) and the cost per kWh of electricity delivery (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) based on the following incomplete OCR reading from a user's utility bill.
