The goal is to determine if X or Y won by analyzing the board and returning only one letter (either X or Y).\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the board and look for patterns. One way to approach this is to iterate over the board and check for gaps. If there are more gaps than non-gaps, then it's likely that the player who filled in the most gaps has won. However, if there are equal number of gaps and non-gaps, it's hard to determine who won without further analysis.\nHere's a sample code in Python that implements this approach:\n```\ndef check_win(board):\n    for i in range(1, 7):\n        for j in range(1, 9):\n            if board[i][j] == 0:\n                continue\n            if not all([x != 0 for x in [board[i - 1][j] if i - 1 >= 1 else None, board[i + 1][j] if i + 1 <= 6 else None, board[j - 1][i] if j - 1 >= 1 else None, board[j + 1][i] if j + 1 <= 6 else None, board[(i + j) % 2][(i + j + 1) % 2]]]):\n                return None\n            return board[i][j]\n    return None\n```\nIn this code, we iterate over the board and check for gaps by looking for zeros. If a zero is found, we skip to the next row. If there are no zeros, we check if the number of gaps is greater than non-gaps using a list comprehension. If it is, then we have a win and return the letter.
