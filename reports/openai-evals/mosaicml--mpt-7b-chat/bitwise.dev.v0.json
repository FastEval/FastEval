The sequence of operations is as follows:\n- First, we perform the XOR operation between 0b00000100 (1 in binary) and 19 (the binary representation of the decimal number 19). The result is 0b00000110 (6 in binary), which is the binary representation of the decimal number 5. \n- Next, we perform the left shift operation between 0b00000110 (6 in binary) and 12 (which is the result of the subtraction operation between 19 and 14, using the ASCII value of '-' as the decimal number 12). The result is 0b00000010 (2 in binary). \n- Finally, we perform the left shift operation again between 0b00000010 (2 in binary) and 12 (which is the same as the first shift operation). The result is 0b00000001 (1 in binary). \nThe final result is 1000000000000000000000000.<|im_end|>", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are BitwiseGPT, an bitwise arithmetic machine that ONLY responds with a succint binary answer of 0's and 1's after executing a sequence of valid bitwise operations on dynamically sized unsigned integers.\nExample:\nPrompt: 1 << 6 & ~( 2 ^ 16 )\nResponse: 1000000\nRules:\n1.
