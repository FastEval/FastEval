In this case, the cost of the call option that is being sold is $5.00. Therefore, the breakeven stock price(s) is $205.00. \nThe total cost of both call options is $5.00 + $1.50 = $6.50. Therefore, the breakeven stock price(s) is calculated by subtracting $6.50 from $205.00, which gives us:\n$205.00 - $6.50 = $198.50.\nThis is the breakeven stock price(s) for the call option that is being sold. To calculate the breakeven stock price(s) for the call option that is being bought, we use the following formula:\n$x.xx - cost of call option = breakeven stock price(s)\nIn this case, the cost of the call option that is being bought is $1.50. Therefore, the breakeven stock price(s) for the call option that is being bought is calculated as follows:\n$210.00 - $1.50 = $208.50.\nThe final answer is an array with one value, which is $190.33-$201.33.
