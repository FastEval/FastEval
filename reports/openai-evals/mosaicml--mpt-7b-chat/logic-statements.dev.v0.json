For example, if we choose a=red oak and t=redwood tree, we can see that (a ∈ O) ∧ (t ∈ T) ∧ (t is tall) is true since red oak is a type of tree and is tall. Therefore, we can conclude that some red oaks are also tall based on the statement. \nSo, the answer is YES."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-15 19:59:08.797356+00:00"}
