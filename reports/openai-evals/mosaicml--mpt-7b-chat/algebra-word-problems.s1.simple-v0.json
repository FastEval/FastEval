The number of girls is 1/3*4 + 1/3*3 = 3/3. Therefore, the total number of students is 6/3 + 3/3 = 9/3. But we know that 9/3 is not a whole number, so this answer is incorrect. To find the correct answer, we can use algebra. Let x be the number of boys and y be the number of girls. We know that x/y = 2/1. After four boys leave, the ratio of boys to girls changes to x/y' = 2/1 - 4/3 = 1. Therefore, both x and y' increase by 4/3. We also know that x+y = 25/2, so x' + y' = 25/2. After the new girls are added, the number of boys increases to x'+4 and the number of girls increases to y'+2. Therefore, the new ratio of boys to girls is x'/y'' = 4/3, which means that x' + 4 = 4y'' + 2. We also know that 2x' + y' = (1 + 1/4)x. Substituting this into the equation we found earlier, we have 2x' + (1 + 1/4)x + 4y'' + 2 = 2x' + 4. Solving for x' we get x' = 6. Therefore, the new number of boys is x' + 4 = 6, and the new number of girls is y' + 2 = 4. The total number of students is then (6/3) + (4/3) = 9/3.
