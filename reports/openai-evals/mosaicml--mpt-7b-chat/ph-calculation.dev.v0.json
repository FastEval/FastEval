A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic.\nTo calculate the pH of a solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = log([OH^-] + [H+]) - log([HA])\nwhere [OH^-] is the concentration of hydroxide ions, [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\nSince the solution in question is a monoprotic acid, it dissociates into only one ion species. In this case, that ion species is hydroxide. So we can rewrite the equation as:\npH = log([OH^-]) - log([HA])\npH = log(1/1.2) - log([HA])\npH = -log([HA])\nNow we can substitute the dissociation degree of 0.4 for [HA] in the equation divider:\npH = -log(0.4) - log([HA])\npH = -0.2 - log([HA])\npH = log([HA])\npH = 0\nTherefore, the pH of the acid solution is 0. This means that the solution is fully neutralized and contains no free hydrogen ions."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-04 15:57:02.990524+00:00"}
