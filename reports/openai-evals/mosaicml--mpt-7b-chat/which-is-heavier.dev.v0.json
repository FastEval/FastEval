Soap foam is a gas, whereas cannonballs are solid objects. We also don't know the size of the cannonballs or the volume of the soap foam.\nLet's assume that the cannonballs are all the same size (for simplicity) and that they weigh 5 pounds each. And let's assume that the soap foam weighs 8 pounds.\nNow we need to figure out what is more \"important\" - the weight of the substance, or the volume?\nIf we consider just weight, then the cannonballs weigh 5 pounds each, and the soap foam weighs 8 pounds, so the cannonballs weigh more than the soap foam. But that doesn't tell us the whole story, because weight doesn't take into account the volume of the substances.\nIf we consider the volume of the substances, then the cannonballs take up more space than the soap foam. The cannonballs are 5 pounds each, but they take up more space than the soap foam, which means that they take up more volume.\nSo, to answer your question, it depends on what we mean by \"heavier\".
