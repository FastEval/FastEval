We need to show that $n_1 = n_2$.\n\nIf both $n_1$ and $n_2$ are even, then $f(n_1) = n_1/2$ and $f(n_2) = n_2/2$. Therefore, $n_1/2 = n_2/2$, which implies that $n_1 = n_2$.\n\nIf both $n_1$ and $n_2$ are odd, then $f(n_1) = 2\\cdot(n_1-1)/2 = n_1-1$ and $f(n_2) = 2\\cdot(n_2-1)/2 = n_2-1$. Therefore, $n_1-1 = n_2-1$, which implies that $n_1 = n_2$.\n\nIf $n_1$ is even and $n_2$ is odd (or vice versa), then $f(n_1)$ and $f(n_2)$ belong to different copies of $\\mathbb{{N}}$ in $\\mathbb{{N}} \\sqcup \\mathbb{{N}}$, and hence cannot be equal.\n\nTherefore, $f$ is injective.\n\n2. **Surjective (Onto)**:\n\nLet $m \\in \\mathbb{{N}} \\sqcup \\mathbb{{N}}$. We need to find $n \\in \\mathbb{{N}}$ such that $f(n) = m$.\n\nIf $m$ belongs to the first copy of $\\mathbb{{N}}$ in $\\mathbb{{N}} \\sqcup \\mathbb{{N}}$, then $m = 1\\cdot k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{{N}}$. Let $n = 2k$. Then $n$ is even and $f(n) = n/2 = k = m$.\n\nIf $m$ belongs to the second copy of $\\mathbb{{N}}$ in $\\mathbb{{N}} \\sqcup \\mathbb{{N}}$, then $m = 2\\cdot k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{{N}}$. Let $n = 2k+1$. Then $n$ is odd and $f(n) = 2\\cdot(n-1)/2 = n-1 = 2k = m$.\n\nTherefore, $f$ is surjective.\n\nSince $f$ is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection and hence an isomorphism between $\\mathbb{{N}}$ and $\\mathbb{{N}} \\sqcup \\mathbb{{N}}$. Therefore, the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{{N}}$ is isomorphic to the disjoint union $\\mathbb{{N}} \\sqcup \\mathbb{{N}}$.\nTEMPLATE CODE:\n```coq\nRequire Import Arith.\n\nDefinition iso (A B : Type) := {{ f : A -> B & {{ g : B -> A | (forall x, g (f x) = x) /\\ (forall x, f (g x) = x) }} }}.\n\nTheorem nat_iso_natpnat : iso nat (nat + nat).\nProof.

We need to show that $n_1 = n_2$.\n\nCase 1: $n_1$ and $n_2$ are both even.\nIn this case, we have $f(n_1) = 1\\cdot n_1/2$ and $f(n_2) = 1\\cdot n_2/2$. Since $f(n_1) = f(n_2)$, we have $1\\cdot n_1/2 = 1\\cdot n_2/2$.

Since $f(n_1) = f(n_2)$, we have $2\\cdot(n_1-1)/2 = 2\\cdot(n_2-1)/2$. Simplifying, we get $n_1-1 = n_2-1$, which implies $n_1 = n_2$.\n\nCase 3: $n_1$ is even and $n_2$ is odd, or vice versa.\nIn this case, $f(n_1)$ and $f(n_2)$ belong to different copies of $\\mathbb{{N}}$.

Let $n = 2m$. Then, $f(n) = 1\\cdot n/2 = 1\\cdot (2m)/2 = m$. Therefore, $f(n) = m$.\n\nCase 2: $m$ belongs to the second copy of $\\mathbb{{N}}$.\nIn this case, $m = 2\\cdot(n-1)/2$ for some odd natural number $n$. Let $n = 2m+1$. Then, $f(n) = 2\\cdot(n-1)/2 = 2\\cdot((2m+1)-1)/2 = m$.

We need to show that $n_1 = n_2$.\n\nCase 1: $n_1$ and $n_2$ are both even.\nIn this case, we have $f(n_1) = 1\\cdot n_1/2$ and $f(n_2) = 1\\cdot n_2/2$. Since $f(n_1) = f(n_2)$, we have $1\\cdot n_1/2 = 1\\cdot n_2/2$. Multiplying both sides by $2$ gives us $n_1 = n_2$.\n\nCase 2: $n_1$ and $n_2$ are both odd.\nIn this case, we have $f(n_1) = 2\\cdot(n_1-1)/2$ and $f(n_2) = 2\\cdot(n_2-1)/2$. Since $f(n_1) = f(n_2)$, we have $2\\cdot(n_1-1)/2 = 2\\cdot(n_2-1)/2$. Simplifying, we get $n_1-1 = n_2-1$, which implies $n_1 = n_2$.\n\nCase 3: $n_1$ is even and $n_2$ is odd, or vice versa.\nIn this case, $f(n_1)$ and $f(n_2)$ belong to different copies of $\\mathbb{{N}}$. Therefore, $f(n_1) \\neq f(n_2)$.\n\nSince $n_1 = n_2$ in all possible cases, we conclude that $f$ is injective.\n\n2. **Surjective (Onto)**:\n\nLet $m$ be an element of $\\mathbb{{N}} \\sqcup \\mathbb{{N}}$. We need to show that there exists $n$ in $\\mathbb{{N}}$ such that $f(n) = m$.\n\nCase 1: $m$ belongs to the first copy of $\\mathbb{{N}}$.\nIn this case, $m = 1\\cdot n/2$ for some even natural number $n$. Let $n = 2m$. Then, $f(n) = 1\\cdot n/2 = 1\\cdot (2m)/2 = m$. Therefore, $f(n) = m$.\n\nCase 2: $m$ belongs to the second copy of $\\mathbb{{N}}$.\nIn this case, $m = 2\\cdot(n-1)/2$ for some odd natural number $n$. Let $n = 2m+1$. Then, $f(n) = 2\\cdot(n-1)/2 = 2\\cdot((2m+1)-1)/2 = m$. Therefore, $f(n) = m$.\n\nSince every element of $\\mathbb{{N}} \\sqcup \\mathbb{{N}}$ has a preimage in $\\mathbb{{N}}$, we conclude that $f$ is surjective.\n\nSince $f$ is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection.

We can see that $id_X$ is a section of $f$ by checking that $f(id_X(0)) = f(0) = 1$ and $f(id_X(1)) = f(1) = 0$, which implies that $id_X$ satisfies the condition for being a section of $f$: $f \\circ id_X = id_X$.\n\nSecond, let $s : X \\to X$ be the function defined by $s(0) = 1$ and $s(1) = 0$. We can see that $s$ is also a section of $f$ by checking that $f(s(0)) = f(1) = 0$ and $f(s(1)) = f(0) = 1$, which implies that $s$ satisfies the condition for being a section of $f$: $f \\circ s = s$.\n\nHowever, $id_X$ and $f$ are not equal, since $id_X(0) = 0$ and $f(0) = 1$.
