Each definition within [DFNS] starts with the prefix [DFN], similarly, each theorem/lemma within [THMS] starts with the prefix [THM].\n3. Finally, [STPS] keyword is used to describe proof steps used to simplify the current goal. Each proof step starts with the prefix [STP], and is possibly a valid Coq tactic ending with a '.'.\n\nThe following example shows the prompt for next proof-step prediction:\n[GLS]\n[GL] 1\na + 0 = a\n[HYPS] 1\n[HYP]a : nat\n[THMS] 1\n[THM]plus_n_O : forall n  nat, n = n + 0\n[THM]plus_O_n : forall n  nat, 0 + n = n\n[THM]plus_n_Sm : forall n m  nat, S (n + m) = n + S m\n[THM]plus_Sn_m : forall n \n[DFNS] 1\n[DFN]nat : Set\n[STPS]\n\nThe ideal output of the above prompt should be:\n[STP]induction a.\n[END]\n\nPlease output only in the specified format."}, {"role": "user", "content": "[GLS]\n[GL] 1\nZ = add Z Z\n[HYPS] 1\n\n[THMS] 1\n[THM]Z : N\n[THM]add : N -> N -> N\n[THM]Nat.add : nat -> nat -> nat\n[THM]andb_true_intro : forall b1 b2  bool, b1 = true /\\ b2 = true -> (b1 && b2)%bool = true\n[THM]andb_prop : forall a b  bool,\n[DFNS] 1\n[DFN]add : N -> N\n[GL] 2\nNXT n = add (NXT n) Z\n[HYPS] 2\n[HYP]IHn : n = add n Z\n[HYP]n : N\n[THMS] 2\n[THM]N_rect : forall P  N -> Type,\n  P Z -> (forall n  N, P n -> P (NXT n)) -> forall n  N, P n\n[THM]N_rec : forall P  N -> Set,\n  P Z -> (forall n  N, P n -> P (NXT n)) -> forall n  N, P n\n[\n[STPS]"}], "options": ["[STP]simpl.\n[END]"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-21 18:09:18.697871+00:00"}
