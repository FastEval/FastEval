That is, A and B are two distinct Belarusian wordforms belonging to the same lemma, and C is a Belarusian wordform belonging to another lemma but sharing all its morphological characteristics with A. The missing wordform, represented by a question mark, should belong to the same lemma as C and share all its morphological characteristics with B. Your task is to output this wordform.
