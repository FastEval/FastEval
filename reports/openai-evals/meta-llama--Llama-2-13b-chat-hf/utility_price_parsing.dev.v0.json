Based on the information provided on your utility bill, I can calculate the cost per kWh of electricity supply and delivery for you.\n\nFirst, let's start with the fixed price energy charge. The charge is $0.026 per kWh, so the cost of 726 kWh would be:\n\n726 kWh x $0.026/kWh = $18.61\n\nNext, let's look at the distribution cost recovery factor. The charge is $0.0005 per kWh, so the cost of 726 kWh would be:\n\n726 kWh x $0.0005/kWh = $0.36\n\nNow, let's add the distribution system charge. The charge is $0.053 per kWh, so the cost of 726 kWh would be:\n\n726 kWh x $0.053/kWh = $37.68\n\nFinally, let's add the total electric delivery charges, which is $42.03.\n\nSo, the total cost per kWh of electricity supply is:\n\n$18.61 + $0.36 + $37.68 = $56.65/726 kWh = $0.078 per kWh\n\nAnd the total cost per kWh of electricity delivery is:\n\n$42.03/726 kWh = $0.057 per kWh\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n{'supply_cost_per_kwh': '$0.078/kWh', 'delivery_cost_per_kwh': '$0.057/kWh'}", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a JSON utility that must return machine-readable JSON as output."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your job is compute the cost per kWh of electricity supply (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) and the cost per kWh of electricity delivery (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) based on the following incomplete OCR reading from a user's utility bill.
