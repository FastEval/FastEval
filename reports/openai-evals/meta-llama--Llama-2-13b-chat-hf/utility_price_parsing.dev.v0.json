Based on the information provided on the utility bill, here are the calculations and the resulting JSON output:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost per kWh of electricity supply:\n\nTotal Electric Charges - Residential-R = 25.02\n\nSince the first 300 kWh is charged at $0.01 per kWh, the cost of the first 300 kWh is:\n\n300 kWh x $0.01 per kWh = $3.00\n\nThe remaining 700 kWh (1000 kWh - 300 kWh) is charged at $0.08 per kWh, so the cost of the remaining 700 kWh is:\n\n700 kWh x $0.08 per kWh = $56.00\n\nTherefore, the total cost of electricity supply is:\n\nTotal cost of electricity supply = $3.00 + $56.00 = $69.00\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost per kWh of electricity delivery:\n\nTotal Energy Charge = 130.25\n\nSince the cost per kWh of electricity delivery is not explicitly mentioned on the utility bill, we can assume that it is the same as the cost per kWh of electricity supply, which is $0.08 per kWh. Therefore, the cost per kWh of electricity delivery is:\n\nCost per kWh of electricity delivery = $0.08 per kWh\n\nNow, let's create the JSON output with the calculated values:\n\n{'supply_cost_per_kwh': '$0.08 per kWh', 'delivery_cost_per_kwh': '$0.08 per kWh'}\n\nI hope this helps!
