Each beetle belongs to one of three possible genera and has 3 possible wing colors: blue, green and turquoise. Randomly they were fertilized and one of the beetles was chosen as a parent to move on to the next generation.\nThe crossover was done by sexual reproducing. How many beetles were there in total, and what were their genotypes? Is the distribution of phenotypes possible according to the dominant polymorphic model?\r\n\r\nSolution:To solve the problem, we need to introduce the polymorphism model. We can assume that the offspring is a mix of the two parent beetles. The dominant hypothesis states that the phenotype is determined by the allele with the higher frequency in the parents. Since Blue is the dominant allele in beetles, all the individuals will inherit the same dominant allele. \r\n\r\nFor F1 individuals, the genotypes of the parents can be BB, BG, or B_ (for the blue allele of first parent or green alleles of the first parent). The two offspring will have the dominant allele of the parents according to the dominant hypothesis. If the dominant allele is blue, the genotypes of the offspring will be B_ (Blue), B_ (Green) or B_ (Turquoise). If the dominant allele is green, the genotypes of the offspring will be BG (Blue), BG (Green) or BG (Turquoise). \r\n\r\nSince we have 3 possible wing colors, there are 3 choose 2 = 3! = 6 possible genotypes in total.

We have 3 possible alleles for color (B, G, T), and they are each equally likely to be present in a given parent population: B: 1/3, G: 1/3, T: 1/3.\n\nWe can then apply the rule of random mating to obtain the offspring. Because there are three alleles, and we assume equal parental allelic frequencies, there must be 3/2 child alleles per parent. If we randomly assign 1 allele to the parent, and 2 alleles to the other parent, we have the following allelic frequencies: B: 1/2, G: 1/3, T: 1/3. If one of the parents is dominant for a given allele, the resulting child will also be dominant.\n\nFor the first example, Blue x Blue -> 4/4 Blue, we know that the parents are both B, so the two alleles from each parent contribute one child allele each. This gives us a 50/50 split between the four possible child genotypes (BB, BG, B_, GG).\n\nFor the second example, Blue x Blue -> 3/4 Blue 1/4 Green, we know that the parents are both B, but one allele is dominant for T in one parent and G in the other. We cannot assign an allele from each parent in such a way as to satisfy the given mating rule, so the only feasible genotypes are: BG (Blue Green), BB (Blue Blue), GG (Green Green), but not B_ (Green) or G_ (Green).

If we assume that B is the dominant allele because it is present in half of the parental instances, the only feasible genotype is GT (Green Turquoise).

However, we are not asked to state impossible distributions, so we will assume that allele A cannot be inherited from ancestry, and that the distribution is 1/4 of BB, 1/2 of BG, 1/2 of GT, and 1/4 of GG.
