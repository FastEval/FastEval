By normal standards, a solution containing an acid should have a dark red color and an odor of alcohol. The pH of that solution can be found by measuring the alkalinity (the amount of dissolved acid in a solution) and by adding the solution to a buffer solution containing only water. The dissolved acid will dissociate and react with the water to form acids or bases, depending on the type of acid in the test solution.\r\n\r\nHowever, as an AI, we cannot perform pH tests in real life. We can estimate the alkalinity of a solution of HR acid by using its dissociation constant R. In this case, R is approximately 0.0108 at 25 °C. By dividing the dissociation degree of HR acid by R, we can estimate the alkalinity of the solution. Assuming the solution contains 0.00005 M of HR acid, the alkalinity is 2.97 e-3 M, which is an imprecise estimate.\r\n\r\nHowever, we can use a simplified approach to estimate the pH of the solution.
