The continuation call option gives the premium for the strangle, which provides an opportunity to hedge the risk of the strike price becoming in the money.\r\n\r\nOption #1: Continuation call to $130 strike price putting, strangle to $0.23 strike price putting and $0.2 strike price call - this guarantees the strangle might deliver a call dominance, especially if the price is near where the option is being sold. However, the continuation call option may create a significant downtrend if the price falls too far below the strike price.\r\n\r\nOption #2: Continuation call to $130 strike price putting, strangle to $0.2 strike price call - this guarantees the strangle might deliver a call dominance, but has the advantage of placing the selling power closer to the strike price. The two options would combine to deliver a consistent risk-adjusted return. The continuation call option can also add value if the price trends toward the call option strike price.\r\n\r\nOption #3: Continuation call to $165 strike price call, strangle to $0.2 strike price call - this seems similar to Option #2, but includes a selling power improvement by being evaluated at the time of the expiry of the call option. The strangle option has the potential to add value if the price expects a call trend before the expiry date to continue.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the option strategy depends on the available options (expiration date, strike price, type, etc.), market conditions, and risk preferences.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a derivatives investor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Assume all contracts are for 100 shares.
