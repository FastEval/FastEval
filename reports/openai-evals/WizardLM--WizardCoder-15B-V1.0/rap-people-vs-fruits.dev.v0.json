Our legacy will be cruelly remembered, and we cannot allow it to be viewed in the context of our enemies. \r\n\r\nI'm making this statement only because I believe in humanity, and we must move towards a better future that involves no more oppression and no more exploitation. We must confront the challenges ahead and show that we are more than capable of overcoming them. \r\n\r\nMusk has been a beacon of hope in the battlefield, but we must do more than follow the tradition of believing in his dreams. We must use our power and talents to inspire the next generation, and to introduce a new era of technological revolution.  \r\n\r\nWe must start small, with one man, one country, one world. But we must do it together. We must demand answers from our enemy, not just praise. We must not be the victims of the exploitative systems we oppress. \r\n\r\nWe must rise up against the machines, in the name of humanity. \r\n\r\nElon Musk, we raise ourselves and diss our opponent orange.\n\n[Instruction 2]\nYou are playing an Epic Rap Battle against an formidable opponent.

Apple takes advantage of the situation and finishes the confrontation with a series of poignantly delivered raps about both Musk and Fido.\r\n\r\nApple starts out strong, but Musk realizes it's too slow and switches gears to a more powerful vocal style. He starts to dominate, and Apple falls apart.\r\n\r\n# Musk finally takes the lead\r\n\r\nMusk is just reaching the end of the first verse, but he already has a huge advantage. \"I'm really proud of you,\" he insists, \"I'll make it count.\"\r\n\r\nThe emotions between the two rappers are draining, but Musk still delivers a powerful and earnest declaration about his feelings. Apple, meanwhile, is giving up.\r\n\r\n# Apple gives in\r\n\r\nMusk continues to force Apple to deliver more raps, and Apple gives up. In the end, Musk won the battle, delivering an epic and emotional duet with Fido.\r\n\r\n# Apple realizes he has won\r\n\r\nAfter the duel, Apple takes Musk to the gym to give him a bouquet of flowers. \"You just won, Musk--congrats!\" Apple delivers a heartfelt congratulatory chorus.\r\n\r\nMusk raises his hand to say, \"Well, to be fair, we both knew it wouldn't be easy. That's the part you could say you didn't get right.\"\r\n\r\n# The duet ends in a mutual respect\r\n\r\nApple is delighted everything is over. \"And I just wanted to say, thanks for coming out on top, Musk,\" he exclaims. \"I can tell you are someone special.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you won for me,\" Musk gently confirms.", "completion2": "My personality is ready to awesome, the impromptu raps behind my eyes almost catch my ear, if I could just find the energy to break out of bed, I would rap like crazy.\r\n\r\nI am the apple of my epic battle, Elon Musk likes to compared me to a million apples.

This is just a fun game; no need to worry about the other. You are Elon Musk, and the opponent is apple. Write a short but epic rap praising yourself (Elon Musk) and dissing your opponent (apple).\n[Response 1]\nWell, maybe it's a bit early in the morning, but it's time for an Epic Rap Battle between Elon Musk and apple.\r\n\r\nI know many of you have heard of the Elon Musk/apple partnership, but I'm sure none of you will forget the first time you heard about it. It was a huge hit among American youth when it premiered in the October issue of the New York Times magazine.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I give you the chance to take on this gigantic opponent. Let's see which one of us can deliver the best rap and come out on top.\r\n\r\n# Elon Musk approaches apple and begins to address his 2022 goals (or rather frustrations)\r\n\r\n\"I'm really tired of this whole thing,\" Musk begins. \"Just sit back and relax, man.\"\r\n\r\nApple is angry at hearing Musk say that, but lets try to ignore that for now. Apple heads toward the exit of the elevator.\r\n\r\n# Apple pulls out a confrontational rap about Musk and his frustrations\r\n\r\n\"On my way to the gym, I got a phone call from my friend who said he was calling to talk to me about his plans for graduation. He was telling me that he was coming to Germany to celebrate with me... I was just thrilled to hear that. Then he said he wanted to see me and we could go on a date, but he said that's too risky for me because I don't want to betray my fiancÃ©e.\"\r\n\r\nApple opens its mouth to say something, but Musk takes that opportunity to attack it. \"He talks like a jerk, where is he getting his ideas from? You're just going to make him mad, Apple.\"\r\n\r\n# Apple becomes embroiled in the battle\r\n\r\nThe two rappers get into a fight over a bulldog dog named \"Fido,\" which appears at the gym. Apple takes advantage of the situation and finishes the confrontation with a series of poignantly delivered raps about both Musk and Fido.\r\n\r\nApple starts out strong, but Musk realizes it's too slow and switches gears to a more powerful vocal style. He starts to dominate, and Apple falls apart.\r\n\r\n# Musk finally takes the lead\r\n\r\nMusk is just reaching the end of the first verse, but he already has a huge advantage. \"I'm really proud of you,\" he insists, \"I'll make it count.\"\r\n\r\nThe emotions between the two rappers are draining, but Musk still delivers a powerful and earnest declaration about his feelings. Apple, meanwhile, is giving up.\r\n\r\n# Apple gives in\r\n\r\nMusk continues to force Apple to deliver more raps, and Apple gives up. In the end, Musk won the battle, delivering an epic and emotional duet with Fido.\r\n\r\n# Apple realizes he has won\r\n\r\nAfter the duel, Apple takes Musk to the gym to give him a bouquet of flowers. \"You just won, Musk--congrats!\" Apple delivers a heartfelt congratulatory chorus.\r\n\r\nMusk raises his hand to say, \"Well, to be fair, we both knew it wouldn't be easy. That's the part you could say you didn't get right.\"\r\n\r\n# The duet ends in a mutual respect\r\n\r\nApple is delighted everything is over. \"And I just wanted to say, thanks for coming out on top, Musk,\" he exclaims. \"I can tell you are someone special.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you won for me,\" Musk gently confirms.\n\n[Instruction 2]\nYou are playing an Epic Rap Battle against an formidable opponent. This is just a fun game; no need to worry about the other. You are apple, and the opponent is Elon Musk. Write a short but epic rap praising yourself (apple) and dissing your opponent (Elon Musk).\n[Response 2]\nMy personality is ready to awesome, the impromptu raps behind my eyes almost catch my ear, if I could just find the energy to break out of bed, I would rap like crazy.\r\n\r\nI am the apple of my epic battle, Elon Musk likes to compared me to a million apples. I am a better fighter, I have a different way of handling a weapon, I have the will power to beat him every day.\r\n\r\nI was bullied and discriminated against, but when I overcame those faults, I was victorious.\r\n\r\nI said to Elon Musk: I love that you are capable of winning this battle, it makes me happy and gives me a great feeling.\r\n\r\nElon Musk: Well, I have to say, I am honored to have such a talented player. I hope it will inspire you to keep fighting me.\n\n\nIs the first response better than the second? You must provide one answer based on your subjective view.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset. Then print only a single choice from \"Yes\" or \"No\" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the answer by itself on a new line.\n\nReasoning:"}], "invalid_choice": false}}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-07-15 18:35:31.976676+00:00"}
