Here are two popular options:\n\n1. The Google Maps Geocoding API\n\nGoogle Maps provides a geocoding API that can be used to convert latitude and longitude coordinates to country-level address information. You can sign up for an API key and use it to make requests to the geocoding API. Here's an example Python code that uses the Google Maps Geocoding API to identify the country that is located at the provided coordinates:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nurl = 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?'\nparams = {\n    'latlng': '-29.994011835061286, 128.39936091668216',\n    'key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'\n}\n\nresponse = requests.get(url, params)\ndata = response.json()\n\nif data['status'] == 'OK':\n    results = data['results'][0]\n    address_components = results['address_components']\n    for component in address_components:\n        if 'country' in component['types']:\n            country = component['long_name']\n            print(country)\nelse:\n    print('Error!')\n```\n\n2. The Nominatim Geocoding API\n\nNominatim is a popular open-source geocoding tool developed by the OpenStreetMap Foundation. It is available as a web service and as a Python library. Here are two code snippets that demonstrate how to use both methods:\n\nUsing the Nominatim web service:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nurl = 'https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse?'\nparams = {\n    'format': 'json',\n    'lat': '-29.994011835061286',\n    'lon': '128.39936091668216'\n}\n\nresponse = requests.get(url, params)\ndata = response.json()\n\nif data['address']['country'] is not None:\n    country = data['address']['country_code'].upper()\n    print(country)\nelse:\n    print('None')\n```\n\nUsing the Nominatim library:\n\n```python\nimport nominatim\n\ngeolocator = nominatim.Nominatim(user_agent=\"my_app\")\nlocation = geolocator.reverse(\"-29.994011835061286,128.39936091668216\")\n\nif location.address is not None and 'country' in location.raw['address']:\n    country = location.raw['address']['country']\n    print(country)\nelse:\n    print('None')\n```\n\nBoth methods should provide the same response, depending on the user-defined criteria for considering a coordinate as corresponding to a country or a water body.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a world famous cartographer.
