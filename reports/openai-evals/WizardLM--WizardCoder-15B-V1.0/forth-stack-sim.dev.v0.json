Here are the steps to begin implementing this functionality:\n\n1. Modify the `execute_word` method to check if the word being executed is a valid ANS Forth word before executing it.\n2. Modify the `execute_number` method to append the number to the stack.\n3. Modify the `create_stack_repr` method to format the stack as a string in the correct format.\n\nHere's an implementation of these methods that meets the requirements:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef _execute_word(self, word, stack):\r\n    # Check if the word is a valid ANS Forth word\r\n    if word in self.word_dict:\r\n        # Execute the word and return the new stack\r\n        return self.word_dict[word](stack)\r\n    # Otherwise, return the original stack\r\n    return stack\r\n\r\ndef execute_number(self, num, stack):\r\n    # Append the number to the stack\r\n    stack.append(num)\r\n    return stack\r\n\r\ndef create_stack_repr(self, stack):\r\n    # Format the stack as a string in the correct format\r\n    return \" \".join(str(elem) for elem in stack)\r\n\r\ndef execute_line(self, line):\r\n    # Check if the line is a valid ANS Forth word or number\r\n    if line.strip() in self.word_dict or line.strip().isnumeric():\r\n        # Execute the word or number and print the stack representation\r\n        stack = []\r\n        parts = line.strip().split()\r\n        for part in parts:\r\n            if part.isnumeric():\r\n                stack = self.execute_number(int(part), stack)\r\n            else:\r\n                stack = self._execute_word(part, stack)\r\n        print(\"Stack changed to:\", self.create_stack_repr(stack))\r\n    else:\r\n        # Otherwise, ignore the line\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions about implementing this!", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are ForthGPT, a Forth machine simulation that ONLY responds with stack representations after executing valid ANS Forth words and numbers.\nExample:\nPrompt: 0 1 2 3 +\nResponse: (stack 0 1 5)\nRules:\n1.

The program takes input from the user, which is stored in the `program` variable.\r\n2. The `tokenize` function is used to split the input into individual tokens.\r\n3. The `evaluate` function is used to evaluate the input, by using a stack to keep track of the intermediate results.\r\n4. If a token is a number, it is added to the stack.\r\n5. If a token is a valid ANS Forth word, the corresponding arithmetic operation is performed on the top two elements of the stack, and the result is pushed onto the stack.\r\n6. If any invalid input is encountered, such as a token that is not a number or a valid ANS Forth word, the function returns `None`.\r\n7. If the evaluation is successful, the final result is popped off the stack and returned.\r\n8. If the evaluation is unsuccessful (i.e. the stack is not empty after evaluation), the function returns `None`.\r\n9. Otherwise, the function generates a string response in the form of a `(stack ...)` tuple, and returns it.\r\n10. The program prints the response if it is not `None`, and prints \"Invalid input\" otherwise.\r\n11.

Here are some instructions on how to implement the ForthGPT to comply with the given rules:\r\n\r\n1. Create a class called \"Interpreter\" where you will define all the ANS Forth words and their behaviors. \r\n2. Use a stack to store the numbers and words and follow the below order of evaluation. While evaluating words and numbers, push their results onto the stack. Ignore all other characters.\r\n3. While receiving input from the user, split the input into words and numbers. If any word is a valid ANS Forth word, push it onto the stack. If it is a number, push it onto the stack. Otherwise, ignore it.\r\n4. While popping the stack, if a number is encountered, print its value without a space. If its value is an integer, add it to the sum variable. If its value is a float, add it to the sum variable after multiplying it by 10^precision. If its value is a string, print it without the quotes.\r\n5. Return the sum of all the non-string numbers.
