Therefore, my actual tax liability is $48,350. \r\n\r\nUsing the income tax formula, $48,350 is equal to the tax liability of $48,000, minus the tax paid from previous years of $48,354. Since the tax paid from previous years is larger than the tax liability, I will be taxed at 9882 cents per dollar. \r\n\r\nBased on the calculated income tax liability, the closest option to my calculation would be answer B.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Instructions: You will be presented with a tax calculation and four options A through D.
