The lot upon which their home was located was eighty-eight feet wide and one hundred thirty feet deep. The home of the defendant was immediately east and adjoining the Galvan lot, and their residences were about forty feet apart and separated by a hedge fence. According to the testimony of the plaintiff, he, the plaintiff, arrived at his home about five o'clock on Friday afternoon, June 19, 1953, from his work as a bricklayer's helper. After he had had his evening meal, he left home about seven o'clock, paid a coal bill to a Mr. Burke, and then he and Burke went to a tavern where they remained an hour and a half, during which time the plaintiff drank two bottles of beer. Mr. Burke went home, and the plaintiff proceeded to another tavern and remained there until after midnight. At the second tavern he had four or five bottles of beer. He than proceeded to another tavern, where he remained for fifteen minutes, and had a glass of beer there. He then proceeded homeward, entering his lot at the rear, and singing as he went along. Sitting upon the steps of the back porch of his home were his wife and daughter, Angela, and when the plaintiff arrived there he stopped singing. He refused his wife's suggestion to go into the house and go to bed but sat down on the porch step, took his shoes, socks, and hat off, cursed the mosquitoes, laid down on the ground under a pear tree three or four feet from the southeast corner of the steps of the rear porch and immediately went to sleep. The plaintiff's wife and daughter, Angela, remained on the porch steps after the plaintiff had laid down under the pear tree. About fifteen minutes after he had gone to sleep, the daughter observed the defendant coming very slowly through the hedge from his property onto the Galvan premises.

The other daughter of the plaintiff, Aurora, was in the house asleep but was awakened by her sister and ran to the yard and saw the defendant 'slashing' at her father with a knife. She called to the defendant to stop and ran for help.

Defendants cut down the south half of a hedge fence which for many years prior to February, 1915, stood upon the line between the southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 (hereinafter referred to as the east forty) and the southwest quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 (hereinafter referred to as the west forty). On and prior to February 13, 1866, both of these forty-acre tracts belonged to a man named Teadrow. On February 13, 1866, Teadrow conveyed the west forty to Benjamin Newman, and on February 15, 1866, conveyed the east forty to Oliver P. Rice. When these conveyances were made there was a hedge fence on the north half of the line and a wooden fence on the south half of the line between the two tracts. In 1868 Benjamin Newman, the owner of the west forty, removed the wooden fence and set out a hedge fence on the south half of the line between the two tracts. Thereafter, during the separate ownership of the tracts, Banjamin Newman trimmed and otherwise cared for the hedge fence on the south half of the line and Rice trimmed and looked after the hedge fence on the north half of the line. In December, 1888, Rice conveyed the southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 to Benjamin Newman, the latter thereby becoming the owner of both tracts. Thereafter, during the ownership of both tracts by Benjamin Newman, he required the tenants of the west forty to take care of the south half and the tenants of the east forty to take care of the north half of the hedge fence on the line between the two tracts. On June 22, 1904, Benjamin Newman executed and delivered to his daughter, F. Eva Newman, the plaintiff, who has since married J. O. Conklin, a warranty deed, conveying to her two hundred acres of land, including the southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16, referred to herein as the east forty, but not including the tract referred to herein as the west forty. This deed contained the provision that 'this deed is not to take effect until after the death of the grantor, Benjamin Newman.' The wife of Benjamin Newman, who is still living, did not join in the conveyance. At the same time plaintiff executed and delivered to her father the following written instrument signed by her: 'Whereas Benjamin Newman has this day conveyed to me certain tracts and parcels of land in Pike county, Illinois, to take effect after his death, I hereby agree to pay the taxes on said land in lieu of all rents that I would otherwise have to pay, (this does not affect any rent that is now due,) and in consideration of my paying said taxes I am to receive all the rents, profits, etc., that may accrue on said land.' When the conveyance was made to plaintiff the tract in controversy known as the east forty was in the possession of Joseph Gifford as tenant and the west forth was in the possession of John B. Newman, a grandson of Benjamin Newman, as tenant of Benjamin Newman. After the delivery of the deed and delivery of possession of the east forty to plaintiff, Benjamin Newman told his tenants of the west forty, and as late as September, 1913, stated to Defendants and others, that the north half of the fence belonged to the east forty and the south half to the west forty. On September 19, 1910, Benjamin Newman executed and delivered to appellant Lee Newman, a son of appellant George R. Newman and a grandson of Benjamin Newman, a lease to the west forty from March 1, 1913, to the first day of March after the death of [***6] Benjamin Newman, in consideration of the agreement of the lessee to pay the taxes assessed against the land each year. At the same time he turned over the delivered to Lee Newman a warranty deed dated February 11, 1908, whereby he conveyed to his son, George R. Newman, the tract known as the west forty for life and the remainder to the children of George R. Newman. This deed also contained the provision that it should not take effect until after the death of the grantor. It was not signed by the grantor's wife, and it seems to have remained in the possession of the grantor until it was delivered to Lee Newman, who in 1914 filed it for record. During the month of January, 1915, a controversy arose between plaintiff and Defendants regarding the ownership of the hedge fence, each party claiming the south half of the fence. During the month of February, 1915, Defendants, over the protest of plaintiff, cut down the south half of the hedge fence on the line between the east forty and the west forty and erected a wire fence in the place thereof."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "options": ["Negative"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-17 20:38:41.907656+00:00"}

Mrs. Lucchetti told the officer that her baby-sitter, Alma Lopez, had related to her that some teenagers had found a large sum of money during the previous week. At about noon on the following day, May 5, Detective Hendle and Mrs. Lucchetti proceeded to the wooded area described by Alma and looked for fresh holes. While looking, defendant William Stevens approached the two women and asked if he could help them. At the time, the officer knew she and Mrs. Lucchetti were on someone's property, but she had no idea whose property, as the property was in an 'abandoned' state. Detective Hendle testified that the property was wooded and overrun with weeds with piles of junk on it and trails leading throughout. Mr. Stevens did not tell the officer that she was trespassing on his property, and Detective Hendle did not observe any signs stating 'no trespassing,' 'keep out,' or anything else of that nature. Mrs. Lucchetti informed Detective Hendle that kids rode their all-terrain vehicles on the wooded property. Kids were present on the property on the date that Detective Hendle and Mrs. Lucchetti were there, but the officer could not recall if they were on all-terrain vehicles or walking. Detective Hendle and Mrs. Lucchetti returned to the Lucchetti residence where they met with Alma Lopez. Alma then accompanied the detective back to the wooded area to show the officer where she and her friends had found the money. Alma pointed out two holes in the center of the property which were, according to the officer, about six to eight inches across and angled downward so that their depth was indeterminable. A pile of dirt was outside the holes as though an animal had burrowed into the ground. Alma told Detective Hendle that she had returned the money she found to the hole and thrown a little bit of dirt over it. The officer dug in the area with a stick but did not find anything. Detective Hendle recalled that Alma asked the officer what would happen if the money could be found. The officer told Alma that if she and her friends had kept the money for safekeeping, she should tell Mrs. Lucchetti or the officer so that 'everything could be handled properly.' If handled properly, the possibility existed that Alma and her friends might be able to claim the money in the future. Detective Hendle did not personally recover any money from Alma or her friends. About 10:30 p.m. on May 5, 1990, Detective Tom Monday of the McHenry County sheriff's police met with Jennifer Moore and her parents at their home. Jennifer told the officer that she and three of her friends [Alma Lopez, Thomas Farrell, and Ryan Baassler] had found a large amount of money in a vacant lot. According to Jennifer, Alma had lied to Detective Hendle because Alma still possessed the money she found. Jennifer admitted that she had some of the money, and she turned it over to the officer. At about 11 p.m. of the same day the officer proceeded to the Lopez residence and recovered the money Alma possessed. At approximately 11:53 p.m. Detective Monday arrived at Thomas Farrell's house and collected Thomas' portion of the found money. From there the officer proceeded to the home of Ryan Baassler where he recovered more of the money. At the home of each of the minors the officer prepared a property inventory sheet, depicting the amount of money recovered, and had the minor sign it. Detective Monday testified that he recovered the money from the minors for safekeeping purposes until the true owner or one determined to be the rightful owner came forward. Jennifer Moore, who was 14 years old at the time of the discovery of the money, related that she found the money in the woods across the street from her house. Jennifer stated that kids customarily ventured into the wooded area, that no signs warned them not to go on the property, that the owner never asked them to stay off the property, that other neighborhood children played on the property, and that the property contained trails for allterrain vehicles and bicycles. Jennifer stated that she found the money on April 30 or May 1 at about 4:30 or 5 p.m. She and Thomas Farrell were walking through the woods when she discovered two holes. Jennifer kicked a mound of dirt next to one of the holes and saw some loose money. Jennifer and Thomas were joined by Alma and Ryan. All four minors grabbed as much money as they could and ran to Jennifer's house where they went behind a shed and counted the money. After Alma, Thomas, and Ryan went home Jennifer hid her money; she did not tell her parents about the money. The following Saturday Jennifer and two of her friends went shopping. Jennifer gave each friend $ 100 of the money. The friends returned to Jennifer any money which they did not spend. On that same day Jennifer told her mother about her discovery. That evening Detective Monday arrived, and Jennifer gave him all the money she possessed. Later, she recovered from her friends the items they bought and returned them. Jennifer was able to recover all the money spent except the money expended for a T-shirt, which could not be returned, and $ 5 to $ 10 spent on food. Jennifer gave the recovered money and the T-shirt to Detective Monday. Jennifer acknowledged that she did not file any documents with the court within five days of May 1, 1990, claiming ownership of the money. Jennifer did not know whether her parents took such action. According to Thomas Farrell, who was 13 years old at the time of the discovery, the money was found on May 1 while he and some friends were wandering in the woods behind a house [the Stevens' house]. Thomas related that Jennifer was looking down a hole and that she turned around and kicked over some dirt, making the money visible. Thomas recalled that the money was not 'really loose' but that he was 'pretty sure it was organized by string or rubber band or just stacked together.' By the time Alma and Ryan joined Thomas and Jennifer, Jennifer was holding the money in her hands, and the others grabbed some money from her. The minors then ran to the shed behind Jennifer's house and counted the larger bills. When Thomas arrived home, he told his mother and father about the money. His father advised him to count the money, place it in an envelope, and put it with his deposit slips. Thomas stated that he did not spend any of the money. Thomas recalled that on May 5 at about 10:30 p.m. Detective Monday came to his house and took possession of his share of the found money.\"\nIn People v. Stevens (753 N.E.2d 836), the Illinois Court of Appeals held that although defendants claimed that plaintiffs committed conversion against them by taking certain sums of money without compensating them, this argument lacked merit since the complaints failed to allege a specific act of conversion.\nHere are the relevant elements of conversion under Illinois law:\n\n1. An unauthorized exercise of dominion or control over another’s personal property.\n2. Intentional dispossession or destruction of the property.\n3. Damage to the plaintiff resulting from the loss of use or value of the property.\n\nThe court emphasized that mere detention or refusal to restore property does not constitute conversion unless done wrongfully or without authority of law. In addition, the court noted that defendants failed to plead specific acts of conversion, instead, they alleged only that plaintiffs converted various amounts of cash. As a result, the court affirmed the dismissal of defendants' counterclaims for conversion.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You will be presented with a court claim and the criminal charge.

When Alma arrived home, her father told her not to do anything with the money. He took possession of the money and hid it. He never advised her to call the police. Alma admitted that when Detective Hendle and Mrs. Lucchetti spoke with her on May 4, she lied about knowing where the money was because she wanted to keep it. When Detective Monday appeared at her house on May 5, Alma turned the money over to him. The officer told her that she would have to wait six months to see if anybody claimed the money. Alma acknowledged that between the date on which she and the others found the money and May 5 she made no effort to find the true owner or to file any documents at the courthouse claiming ownership of the money. Ryan Baassler, 13 years old at the time the minors discovered the money, described the property where the money was found as 'wooded' or 'wild' with a couple of trails through it. According to Ryan, Jennifer and Thomas were walking in the wooded area on May 1, 1990, with Alma and Ryan following behind when Jennifer found some money on the ground and picked it up. Ryan remembered the money was loose 'with no fasteners around it.' Ryan said he took some money from Jennifer's hands. Then, all the minors proceeded to Jennifer's house where they made a rough count of the money. When Ryan arrived home, he put his money in his closet. He did not tell his parents about the money until Detective Monday came to recover it on May 5 because he wanted to keep the money. When Detective Monday arrived on the night of May 5, Ryan turned over to the officer the money he still possessed. Subsequently, Ryan recovered $ 145 he had given his mother to put in the bank and also replaced with his own money the money he had spent on a couple of T-shirts. Ryan recalled hearing Detective Monday state that there was a six-month waiting period and if no one claimed the money within that time, the money would be returned to the minors. Ryan acknowledged that he never tried to find the true owner of the money between the time of the discovery and the time of Detective Monday's recovery nor did he file any documents at the courthouse claiming ownership of the money. Thomas Farrell, Sr., testified that he was present on the evening of May 5 when Detective Monday came to collect the money found by his son. Mr. Farrell related that he wondered if his son was obligated to try to contact the rightful owner or if his son could claim ownership of the money if the rightful owner was not found. Consequently, he asked Detective Monday if there was any further action that needed to be undertaken. Detective Monday replied negatively. According to Mr. Farrell, he assumed from the officer's negative response that his son had no further obligations or responsibilities under the law. Mr. Farrell acknowledged that he did not file any documents with the court claiming ownership of the money for his son nor did he attempt to find the true owner."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "options": ["Negative"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-17 20:39:01.358871+00:00"}

The manufacturing operations at these facilities generated waste material that contaminated the Site. As a result, the Site and some surrounding areas presently contain elevated levels of cadmium, lead, and other metals. According to EPA assessments, the increased concentrations of metals in the area pose no short-term threats to nearby populations; however, the EPA has expressed general concern about potential long-term adverse health effects resulting from elevated amounts of cadmium. After taking note of the Site in 1980, the EPA conducted preliminary environmental assessments in following years pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ('CERCLA'), 42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq. In 1992, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency ('IEPA') also began to investigate the Site pursuant to its authority under Illinois law. As a result of the EPA's and IEPA's investigations and assessments, the EPA added the Site to the National Priorities List in 1999. This addition confirmed the Site's status as one of the most contaminated spots in the United States. In 1995, prior to the Site's official placement on the NPL, the Illinois Attorney General filed suit against Defendants' corporate predecessors in Illinois circuit court (at the IEPA's request) pursuant to the Illinois Environmental Protection Act ('the Illinois Act'), 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/22.2 & 42(d), (e). As a result of the Attorney General's suit, Defendants entered into an interim consent order ('Consent Order') with the People of the State of Illinois. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has described Defendants' responsibilities under the Consent Order as follows: 'Under this Consent Order, [Defendants] must perform a phased investigation of the site and implement certain interim remedies. [They] also must propose final remedies to the State of Illinois before completing final remedial action for the site. The Consent Order requires [Defendants] to perform . . . investigations and remedial actions in compliance with both the ICP (Illinois Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan) and the NCP (National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency [*858] Plan). The State of Illinois, in consultation with the EPA, has sole discretion to decide if the final remedies proposed by [Defendants] are appropriate. The activities completed under the Consent Order are subject to approval by the State of Illinois.' Currently, Defendants are in the process of conducting remedial investigations and feasibility studies at the Site, i.e. gathering data about the nature and extent of the contamination and evaluating possible cleanup options. As part of this phase of the cleanup, Defendants are collecting information about possible risks to human health. The Consent Order expressly requires this type of health-related investigation. While, overall, Defendants are at the investigatory stage of the cleanup process, they have already implemented certain limited environmental remedies at the Site, including a dust control program and a water treatment system to treat surface water discharging into Lake DePue. After Defendants complete their remedial investigations, they will conduct design studies and, then, begin permanent remediation at the Site. Defendants have spent over $ 30 million in connection with Site cleanup, and it is undisputed that Defendants are fulfilling their responsibilities under the Consent Order. Dissatisfied with Defendants' rate of progress in cleaning up the Site, the Village decided to take matters into its own hands in August 2006. Pursuant to a local nuisance ordinance (Section 7-5-3 of the DePue Village Code), the Village posted 'Notice[s] to Abate Nuisance' at the Site. These notices directed Defendants to perform an immediate cleanup of the Site, under penalty of $ 750 for each day the Site remained a nuisance. In October 2006, the Village brought suit against Defendants in Illinois circuit court, alleging violations of the nuisance ordinance. The Village sought the following relief: a declaratory judgment that Defendants were in violation of the ordinance; fines of $ 750 for each day Defendants were in violation; and an injunction requiring Defendants to immediately complete a total cleanup of the Site. Id. Defendants removed the suit to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction and filed a motion to dismiss. This Court granted the motion to dismiss, holding the Village's claims to be preempted by federal and state law. The Village appealed, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this Court's dismissal based on state law preemption. The Court of Appeals began its consideration of the state law preemption issue in DePue I by stressing the Village's status as a non-home-rule municipality with limited powers under the Illinois Constitution. Specifically, the court noted the Village's lack of authority to enforce any ordinance conflicting with the spirit and purpose of a state statute. The Court of Appeals went on to hold that the Village's use of its nuisance ordinance to force Defendants to perform an immediate cleanup of the Site undoubtedly conflicted with the spirit and purpose of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act. The court recognized, '[B]ecause environmental damage does not respect political boundaries, it is necessary to establish a unified statewide program for environmental protection . . . environmental problems are closely interrelated and must be dealt with as a unified whole in order to safeguard the environment.' Applying the preemption standard for non-home-rule municipalities in Illinois, the Court of Appeals concluded as follows: 'The Village's application of its nuisance ordinance seeks to address, in a heavy-handed manner, a difficult environmental problem that certainly is not only of local concern. If the Village were permitted to apply its nuisance ordinance to force [Defendants] to complete immediately the cleanup of the site, on penalty of $ 750 per day for noncompliance, then it could prevent compliance with the measured cleanup process adopted by Illinois through the Consent Order under the authority of Illinois law. Such a result would frustrate the purpose of the Illinois Act. The Illinois legislature enacted the Illinois Act in order to safeguard the environment and to restore contaminated areas through a phased and carefully considered  process. Ignoring this process by conducting and concluding a cleanup to the satisfaction of the Village is not a plan in service to the goals of the Illinois Act. Therefore we find the Village's application of its nuisance ordinance to conflict with the purposes set out in section 5 of the Illinois Act, and accordingly to be preempted by virtue of the operation of sections 605 and 605.1 of the Illinois Municipal Code. Additionally, because the requirements imposed by the Village's nuisance ordinance are found in a provision of Title 7 of the DePue Village Code, which regulates Land Usage and Zoning, this Court holds such provisions of Title 7 to likewise be preempted by the broad power vested in the Illinois legislature to regulate land usage within the borders of our state.' Finding the Village's nuisance ordinance to be preempted by state law, the Court of Appeals did not reach the question whether the ordinance was preempted by federal law. It reversed this Court's grant of Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion without reaching the merits of Plaintiffs' third amended complaint.\n[*859] Based on this background information, what is your judgement?

Ignoring this process by conducting and concluding a cleanup to the satisfaction of the Village is not a plan in service to the goals of the Illinois Act. The Village's application of its nuisance ordinance in this case is overreaching because it attempts to regulate an environmental hazard that is not local in nature and that already is subject to a cleanup under the authorization and direction of the state. Accordingly, we hold that the Village's claims are preempted by the Illinois Act.' Despite its loss in DePue I, the Village has initiated this second lawsuit, against the same defendants, based on the effects of pollution at the Site. There are some key differences this time around, however. First, the Village is now a home-rule unit of local government. According to the Amended Complaint, on November 4, 2008, Village of DePue voters passed a referendum to adopt home-rule status under the Illinois Constitution. As a home-rule municipality, the Village now has greater autonomy in governing its local affairs. The second difference is that the Village is suing under a new ordinance. On September 8, 2008 (after the Seventh Circuit issued its decision in DePue I) the Village enacted a new 'Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Substances' ordinance pursuant to authorization under a public health provision within the Illinois Municipal Code. On November 10, 2008, after becoming a home-rule municipality, the Village amended the ordinance to reflect municipal home-rule status. The amended ordinance prohibits any person, entity, or corporation from owning, controlling, or possessing 'real property by lease, trust or deed which contains hazardous wastes or hazardous substances.' The terms 'hazardous waste' and 'hazardous substances' are defined by cross-references to parallel provisions of the Illinois Act. In addition, the ordinance gives Village authorities the discretion to determine what is hazardous to public health and safety. The original version of the hazardous substances ordinance, enacted on September 8, 2008, provided for a fine of up to $ 750 per day of violation. The November 10, 2008 amendment increased that penalty significantly to a one-time fine of up to $ 50,000 and a recurring daily fine of up to $ 10,000. It seems apparent that the Village designed the November 10, 2008 amendment to target Defendants in connection with the Site. In a resolution adopted contemporaneously with the amendment, the Village charged Defendants with adversely affecting the health and safety of Village residents by maintaining hazardous substances at the Site. With this resolution, the Village slapped Defendants with the maximum fines allowed under the amended ordinance."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "options": ["Negative"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-17 20:39:20.462875+00:00"}

Isidor Simon and his son, codefendant Ned B. Simon, were officers of the Mundelein Realty Corporation. In order to prepare its land for development and ultimate occupancy, Mundelein Realty Corporation balanced its land by removing topsoil and trees so that sewers, streets, water mains, curbs, fire hydrants and gutters could be installed.

When the equipment is maintained, repaired, or 'torn down,' employees of A.C. Equipment oversee the work to ensure it is performed in accordance with standards and specifications. The overseers perform broad and varied duties including 'receiving readings from workers.' In the spring of 1989, A.C. Equipment and Springfield scheduled maintenance on the turbines at Lakeside Two. TGM was contracted to be a labor broker and to hire the workers to perform the repairs on the turbines. Defendants Davis and Fitzgerald were project manager supervisors employed by Springfield, and Bee, also a Springfield employee, was a supervisor in charge of maintenance projects at Lakeside Two. Defendant Alemi was the employee of A.C. Equipment who was overseeing the turbine maintenance project at Lakeside Two. At a pre-job meeting, Davis, Fitzgerald, Bee and Alemi discussed the fact that asbestos insulation was present on and around the turbines, but decided not to have the asbestos professionally removed because that would significantly delay the project. On April 24, 1989, and subsequent thereto, asbestos samplings indicated that significant asbestos was on and around the turbines on which plaintiffs were working. Purchase and repair records maintained at Lakeside Two indicated the types of insulation previously removed during maintenance projects and the types of new insulation used to replace that which had been removed.

Southbound passenger trains take the west track and northbound trains the east track. Between these two main tracks, from the switch tower to the depot and public square, there is a space a little over ten feet wide filled level with the tops of the ties with cinders and ballast, making a smooth, even walk and path, which is traveled and used by defendant's employees and others quite generally, both for business and pleasure. Persons who have occasion to go that way use the path, and people are accustomed to walk out along the path on Sundays for recreation. There is a public road adjoining the right of way on the west, leading into the public square at Carbondale, but the path between the tracks makes a better walk, especially in muddy weather. Between the tower and the depot there are junctions of branch lines or divisions with the main line, and there are also side tracks in addition to the two main tracks. At the time of the accident the fast mail train due at Carbondale at 11:20 A.M. was approaching from the north. The day was clear and the weather very warm. There was nothing to obstruct the view of the train, or the view from the train of any person on the track. The deceased was walking from the north between the main tracks toward the public square and depot. The train whistled north of the switch tower, and at that point took the west track. As the train approached, the deceased was a short distance north of a switch stand which was a little over seven hundred feet north of the depot. The train was running about fifteen miles an hour, and there was an ordinance limiting the speed of passenger trains within the city to ten miles an hour. Until the train was close to him the deceased was walking in the center between the two tracks, and was entirely out of danger. The engineer was on the right side of the cab, in his place, and the head of the engine cut off his view of the deceased about one hundred and twenty-five feet before reaching him. As the train approached, the deceased veered toward the track the train was on, and just before he was struck was seen by the postal clerk, a switch hand and another witness to be in a position of danger. The judgment of the postal clerk, in his testimony for the plaintiff, was that the train was within one hundred feet of the deceased when it was plain to be seen that he was going toward the track, and that he was within four or five feet of the engine when it seemed as though he was close enough to be struck by it. Plaintiff's witnesses differed somewhat in their opinions as to the distance from the train when he came close enough to the track to be struck by the engine, but they agreed that it was a very short distance. The switch hand testified that at the time the deceased was struck he was wiping the sweat off from his face; that he took a handkerchief out of his right-hand hip pocket and wiped off the sweat just as he was struck. The witness beckoned to him to get away from the track and also called to him, but could not make him hear. The pilot-beam extended over the rail sixteen or eighteen inches, -- about as far as the ends of the ties. No signal was given and the speed of the train was not checked."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "options": ["Positive"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-17 20:39:28.945182+00:00"}

In 1961, due to backups into homes serviced by the system, the city built an overflow outlet on East Madison Street. The overflow was to relieve pressure in the sewer system during periods of heavy rainfall; it proved successful in preventing backups into nearby homes. However, when water escaped through the overflow, raw sewage was also discharged into an open ditch that flowed into a neighboring pond. In December 1974, the city of O'Fallon closed the overflow. On January 10, 1975, and on subsequent dates, sewage backed up into the plaintiff's house following heavy rainfall. The January 10 backup was the worst, causing water to accumulate in the plaintiff's finished basement to a height of 25 1/2 inches. The lower level of the plaintiff's modern, ranch-style home contained a family room with fireplace and built-in bookshelves, bedroom, closet, bath and utility room with washer, dryer, furnace and water heater. The walls were watermarked, and the tile floor was damaged, as were the furnishings, appliances and many irreplaceable family items such as family photographs and slides. The lower level of the house was virtually unusable for a year, and the plaintiff had to expend considerable time, effort and money in repairing the floor, repainting the walls, and replacing and removing damaged personalty. The city knew the blocking of the overflow would cause some backup, although they were not aware that it would be as severe as it was. From January until April or May 1975, when the city reopened the overflow, the city attempted to alleviate the pressure in the sewer system by pumping the water from the sewers into open ditches during periods of heavy rain. The defendant used either large or small pumps, depending upon the amount of water in the system. The backups into Mrs. Dial's home ended after the overflow was reopened in April or May 1975."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "options": ["Positive"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-17 20:39:29.853410+00:00"}

Defendants cut down the south half of a hedge fence which for many years prior to February, 1915, stood upon the line between the southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 (hereinafter referred to as the east forty) and the southwest quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 (hereinafter referred to as the west forty). On and prior to February 13, 1866, both of these forty-acre tracts belonged to a man named Teadrow. On February 13, 1866, Teadrow conveyed the west forty to Benjamin Newman, and on February 15, 1866, conveyed the east forty to Oliver P. Rice. When these conveyances were made there was a hedge fence on the north half of the line and a wooden fence on the south half of the line between the two tracts. In 1868 Benjamin Newman, the owner of the west forty, removed the wooden fence and set out a hedge fence on the south half of the line between the two tracts. Thereafter, during the separate ownership of the tracts, Banjamin Newman trimmed and otherwise cared for the hedge fence on the south half of the line and Rice trimmed and looked after the hedge fence on the north half of the line. In December, 1888, Rice conveyed the southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 to Benjamin Newman, the latter thereby becoming the owner of both tracts. Thereafter, during the ownership of both tracts by Benjamin Newman, he required the tenants of the west forty to take care of the south half and the tenants of the east forty to take care of the north half of the hedge fence on the line between the two tracts. On June 22, 1904, Benjamin Newman executed and delivered to his daughter, F. Eva Newman, the plaintiff, who has since married J. O. Conklin, a warranty deed, conveying to her two hundred acres of land, including the southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16, referred to herein as the east forty, but not including the tract referred to herein as the west forty. This deed contained the provision that 'this deed is not to take effect until after the death of the grantor, Benjamin Newman.' The wife of Benjamin Newman, who is still living, did not join in the conveyance. At the same time plaintiff executed and delivered to her father the following written instrument signed by her: 'Whereas Benjamin Newman has this day conveyed to me certain tracts and parcels of land in Pike county, Illinois, to take effect after his death, I hereby agree to pay the taxes on said land in lieu of all rents that I would otherwise have to pay, (this does not affect any rent that is now due,) and in consideration of my paying said taxes I am to receive all the rents, profits, etc., that may accrue on said land.' When the conveyance was made to plaintiff the tract in controversy known as the east forty was in the possession of Joseph Gifford as tenant and the west forth was in the possession of John B. Newman, a grandson of Benjamin Newman, as tenant of Benjamin Newman. When [the plaitiff's] father delivered the deed of June 22, 1904, he took her upon the east forty and told her and Gifford, the tenant, that he was placing her in full possession of the tract; that she was to receive all the rents and profits from the land and was to keep up the repairs and pay the taxes; that she was to have the south half of the fence on the line between the east forth and the west forty and was to keep up that part of the fence, and that George Newman, his son, to whom he then intended to deed the west forty, should keep up the north half of the fence, and that thereafter plaintiff and her tenants kept the south half of the fence in repair while the tenants in possession of the west forty made repairs to the north half of the fence. During the month of January, 1915, a controversy arose between plaintiff and Defendants regarding the ownership of the hedge fence, each party claiming the south half of the fence. During the month of February, 1915, Defendants, over the protest of plaintiff, cut down the south half of the hedge fence on the line between the east forty and the west forty and erected a wire fence in the place thereof."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "options": ["Positive"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-17 20:39:30.879600+00:00"}
