Under general principles of contract law, parties are free to negotiate and agree upon terms governing their relationship, including restrictions on prepayment. Therefore, the two-year prepayment prohibition is likely enforceable unless there is evidence of fraudulent inducement, unfairness, or other grounds for invalidating the clause. Similarly, the prepayment fee provision appears to be a reasonable agreement between the parties regarding the costs associated with prepayment, which would also be enforceable absent such defenses. Accordingly, the attorney is likely to advise that the two-year prepayment prohibition and the prepayment fee provision are both valid and enforceable under the circumstances described in the fact pattern.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nA man borrowed $500,000 from a bank, securing the loan with a mortgage on a commercial building he owned.

Thereafter, prepayment may be made in any amount at any time but only if accompanied by a prepayment fee of 5% of the amount prepaid.\" One year later, the man received an unexpected cash gift of $1 million and wished to pay off the $495,000 principal balance still owed on the loan. $495,000 principal balance still owed on the loan. Concerned that the bank might refuse prepayment, despite a rise in market interest rates in the year since the loan was made, or at least insist on the 5% prepayment fee, the man consulted an attorney concerning the enforceability of the above-quoted clause. There is no applicable statute. What is the attorney likely to say? \nA) The two-year prepayment prohibition is unenforceable, but the prepayment fee provision is enforceable.\nB) The entire clause is unenforceable, because the rise in interest rates will allow the bank to reloan the funds without loss.\nC) The entire clause is unenforceable, because it violates a public policy favoring the prompt and early repayment of debt.\nD) The two-year prepayment prohibition and the prepayment fee provision are both valid and enforceable.", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-18 04:47:10.574370+00:00"}
