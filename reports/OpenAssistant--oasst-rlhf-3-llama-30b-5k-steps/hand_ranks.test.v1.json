There is also another way to look at this as well, since there are four aces present, we could consider it four of a kind and then the other combination would be a straight flush (A-A-A-2-2), but since both ways are valid and have different meanings, I prefer to stick with the official definition for now. However you can treat it as either depending on your use case. For example, if you're trying to get the maximum possible hand given certain constraints, the four of a kind might help you achieve better hands than otherwise.
