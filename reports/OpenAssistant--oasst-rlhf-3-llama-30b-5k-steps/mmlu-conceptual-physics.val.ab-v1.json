This means that if you look at something moving slowly in space, it will appear to move under the laws of classical physics, which were developed by Sir Isaac Newton.

These observations led Albert Einstein to develop his famous theories of special and general relativity. The correspondence principle states that there should be a relationship between Newtonian physics and relativistic physics. In other words, both theories are different ways of looking at the exact same thing.
