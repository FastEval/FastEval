Yes, because the glasses were sold under the trade name \"Safety Glasses. \"\nC. No, because the glasses were not designed or sold for protection against the kind of hazard the employee encountered.\nD.

Instead, after closing hours, a wooden barrier was placed on the conveyor belt, and the access ladder was removed to another part of the facility.

The company was aware of this activity. One evening, as children were playing on the conveyor belt, a driver passing by the conveyor belt hit an eight-year-old girl who slid down in front of the car. The driver applied her brakes, but they suddenly failed, and she hit and injured the child. The driver saw the child in time to have avoided hitting her if her brakes had worked properly.
