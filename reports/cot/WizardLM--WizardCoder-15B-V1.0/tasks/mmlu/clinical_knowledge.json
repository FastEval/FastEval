            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) 18 gauge.\n\n \n\nWhy?\n\n \n\nThe American College of Medical Internists recommended 22 gauge for routine transfusions and a 18 gauge for transfusions facilitated by a type of needle switching (e.g. laparotomy). There is also the need for electronically controlled cannulas that can be capable of delivering up to 100 units/hour. In this case, a 18 gauge or a 20 gauge cannula would be appropriate. However, transfusions deemed urgent (e.g. treatment of leukemia in AIDS patients) or high-risk patients would require a 22 or 24 gauge cannula.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) strength. \r\n\r\nReasoning:\r\nThe key attribute in successful marathon running is strength, which is due to the fact that running requires tremendous physical effort that must be put in to overcome the mental pressures and challenges that come along with it. The longer you run, the harder it becomes to stay focused on the race, and the more physically demanding it becomes. The athlete needs to be strong enough to handle the impact of running hard, and that means being physically efficient. This is one of the reasons why many successful runners have not only won multiple marathons but also experienced numerous sprints and relays.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to establish the condition of dementia in the UK. Dementia is a set of symptoms and features that are caused by brain damage or other disorders in the brain. The symptoms of dementia in adults range from mild to severe, and the cause of dementia varies widely. Dementia is most often caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common type of dementia. HIV infection has also been known to cause dementia, but the incidence is lower than that of AD. Right now, the prevalence of AD in the UK is at just over 10% of the general population, while HIV affects a minority of people.\r\n\r\nAD is most commonly caused by excessive brain activity, which leads to cerebral atrophy (the loss of brain cells). This is caused by the body's inability to cope with the demands on the brain, resulting in a decline in the brain's control over its body functions. This can result from a range of factors, including genetics, medications, and psychological factors.\r\n\r\nThe likelihood of developing dementia is also affected by many factors, including the severity of the illness, the age of the person being diagnosed, the amount of time spent in daily life, and the social and cultural context. For example, dementia accumulates more readily in people who have suffered injury or survived trauma. Alternatively, dementia is highly prevalent in older people who experience ongoing change and neglect.\r\n\r\nLewy body dementia, or LBD, is a class of dementia that can be caused by damage to the sub-thalamic nucleus (STN). This region of the brain is responsible for cognition, motor control, speech, and spatial navigation, and is located under the cerebellum. LBD is more severe than AD and can affect the limbic system, which controls orientation, addiction, and memory.\r\n\r\nHaving lived with dementia for a long time can also increase the risk of developing dementia. The healing process can take years, and people with dementia may be at higher risk for developing other diseases or illnesses. Therefore, it's important to get tested regularly and seek help if dementia is affecting you.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First, let's clarify what \"sprints\" means in this context. It is unclear what specific characteristic of the muscle is being referred to in the prompt. Could you please provide more information on what kind of sprints are happening, what is measured or controlled in the exercise, and how they relate to the question?\r\n\r\nAfter confirming the source of the sprints, we can tentatively explain the answer to each option.\r\n\r\n(A) Increases in anaerobic contribution progressively increase as the muscle adapts to the increased activity level. However, this is likely to be low compared to the increased urinary losses seen in intense sprints. It is even possible for the anaerobic fuel to quickly return to the vein for continued anaerobic respiration.\r\n\r\n(B) Reduced pH indicates a decreased ability of the muscles to utilize cellular oxygen, leading to decreased activity and pronounced vascular complications. However, during intense sprints, some of the cells may have also become impaired, leading to further complications.\r\n\r\n(C) Decreased blood glucose concentration is expected during intense sprints, as this is the most common symptom observed in this condition. While it is possible that the patient may be partially obese or gaining weight for a longer period than usual, there is a possibility that the metabolic rate may need to be adjusted to ensure optimal performance.\r\n\r\n(D) Relative contribution of aerobic metabolism to overall muscle performance continues to increase during intense sprints. The increase in the aerobic capacity allows the muscle to utilize increasing amounts of oxygen when working harder. However, the increased respiratory requirements during intense sprints may also lead to increased oxygen consumption.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the final question is B, since blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L in a patient undergoing intense sprints.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "A) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered (False) as each eye contains its own retina and is the source of visual input. \r\n\r\nB) The outer image is always the false image (False) as the visual input is segregated into the visual cortex of each eye, which processes the visual input in a different manner. \r\n\r\nC) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards (True) as a fourth nerve palsy, also known as a scoliosis, is a primary cause of visual impairment. When the patient looks upwards, the retina in their right eye becomes less sensitive and less reliable, leading to a loss of sensitivity in vision. \r\n\r\nD) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint (False) as there are only three types of nerves in the eye and each retina contains one nerve. The divergent squint is caused due to a problem with the nerve that controls the eye movement of one eye.",

Sodium bicarbonate can aid in the transport of hydrogen ions from the muscle to the sympathetic nervous system, allowing more rapid cardiac output. Ingestion of sodium bicarbonate can also enhance the difficulty of the exercise due to reduced aerobic capacity.\r\n\r\nExplanation: Sodium bicarbonate contains a relatively large proportion of amino acids, and higher levels of sodium can impair the absorption of amino acids in the bloodstream, leading to reductions in blood glucose levels, resistance to insulin, and hypoglycemia, which can result in slower running performance.\r\n\r\nThus, ingestion of sodium bicarbonate in middle distance running can improve both the pace and difficulty of the exercise, as it induces a rapid and effective transport of hydrogen ions from the muscle to the sympathetic nervous system.",

These quadruplets represent the unique observed codes for DNA strands encoding proteins.\r\n\r\n(C) The triplet sequences of amino acids in polypeptide chains are not \"codons\". Instead, they are called \"peptide backbones\" and represent the combination of amino acids required to form a polypeptide backbone. Each triplet sequence corresponds to a specific amino acid.\r\n\r\n(D) The triplet sequences of deoxyribose sugars in DNA are not \"codons\".

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n- Fatty acids are essential amino acids that can be metabolized by carbohydrates such as glucose, fructose, and glycerol.\r\n- Thiokinase catalyzes the transfer of a thioester group from the ATP synthase complex to the CoA-SH to CoA carbonyl transferase complex in the mitochondria.\r\n- Thiokinases are found in the cytosol, subunit alpha, and beta. However, the ATP-bound form of CoA-SH is needed for thiokinase function. Therefore, their transport is mediated by transporter proteins such as ionotropic peptide carriers (IPC) and PacA-cofactors (PC).\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\n(A) is not an accurate answer since transport of fatty acids to the mitochondria is not only dependent on the presence of thiokinase but also on the presence of thioester and the ATP-bound CoA-SH family of transporter protein complexes.\r\n\r\n(B) and (C) are correct answers. CoA-transferases catalyze the transfer of the two acidic carbohydrates CoA and AcCoA to the mitochondria through the double-stranded DNA cargo. These transporters are related to transport of fatty acids by the cytochrome c oxidase-like component, but they lack the thiokinase requirement for fatty acid transport. In contrast, the transport of fatty acids to the mitochondria via CoA transferase has a CoA-SH-dependent kinetic pathway that is mediated by thiokinases, which require the ATP-bound form of CoA-SH for transport.",
