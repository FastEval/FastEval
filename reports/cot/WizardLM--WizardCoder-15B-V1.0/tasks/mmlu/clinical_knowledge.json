            "model_answer": "If a patient needed a rapid blood transfusion and was given an 18-gauge cannula, there are two possible scenarios:\n1. The patient may be pregnant and in need of an extra supply of blood. In this case, another 18-gauge cannula can be used.\n2. The patient is a healthy adult and has little or no need to urgently obtain blood. In that case, the patient can use their standard two-hour 18-gauge cannula that is normally used for transfusions.\n\nGiven the limited available resources and patient needs, the recommendation is to use a 18-gauge cannula for both scenarios. That being said, the recommendation would depend on the patient's needs and if using a 20- or 24-gauge cannula is feasible based on constraints and available resources.",

            "question": "The key attribute in successful marathon running is:\n\n(A) strength.\n(B) power.\n(C) stride length.\n(D) stamina.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First, we have to understand the word \"successful\". Running a marathon is not necessarily successful when it exceeds the time limit or fails to reach the desired distance. Rather, successful means that the athlete stands firm in the race, hits the hardest terrain, and maintains an impressive pace throughout. \r\n\r\nAssuming that the athlete is successful, there are four key attributes that make them successful in running:\r\n\r\n1. **Strength**: Strong training and the ability to overcome obstacles are essential to successfully running a marathon. Athletes who are not physically or mentally able to cope with strain are unlikely to complete the race.\r\n\r\n2. **Power**: The power of the athlete has a significant impact on their speed, and success depends on their ability to pump harder and faster than their opponents. Running without proper form and conditioning is likely to lead to disappointment during the race.\r\n\r\n3. **Stride Length**: Athletes have to be mindful of their stride length and distance between the rings to maintain their pace throughout the race. Good form also plays a significant role in maintaining the rhythm and consistency throughout the race.\r\n\r\n4. **Stamina**: Running is a physically demanding sport, and therefore, it requires athletes with a high level of physical fitness and endurance to overcome the rigors of the race. Athletes who are overly obese or injured are likely to fail to complete the race.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer is (C) stride length because it involves training and endurance that go beyond physical strength or power.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "There are 3 possible answers: A, B, and C.\r\n\r\nReasoning:\r\n\r\nA likely explanation for dementia is Alzheimer's disease, which affects approximately 4% of people in the UK. Alzheimer's is a progressive dementia, which means that it can lead to long-term memory loss.\r\n\r\nCerebrovascular disease is a more distant cousin to Alzheimer's disease, which is caused by damage to the brain caused by stroke. There are over 5 million stroke patients in the UK alone, which is highly correlated with dementia rates.\r\n\r\nLewy-body dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the spinal cord and brainstem, which can result in weakened nervous system function. However, there are far fewer cases of this disease compared to Alzheimer's disease, so it is hard to say for certain without further research.\r\n\r\nFinally, HIV can lead to dementia, but the prevalence of HIV in the UK is much lower than in other countries and the risk is low enough that it may not be the cause of dementia in the majority of cases.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer to the question is C: Lewy-body dementia.",

            "question": "With an increasing number of sprints the:\n\n(A) anaerobic contribution progressively increases.\n(B) pH of the muscle falls below 6.0.\n(C) blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L.\n(D) relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Given that anaerobic contribution is increasing, the answer is likely (A).\r\n\r\nAnaerobic contribution is considered to be a state of the organism where energy is required for survival using non-organic or intracellular sources such as oxygen. In anaerobic condition, cells do not use sunlight or other forms of oxygen and therefore use other carbohydrates and proteins for energy. However, with an increasing number of sprints, the anaerobic ability of the muscle decreases and progressively becomes more suitable for cellular processes, resulting in an increase in anaerobic respiration.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Given that aerobic respiration is progressively becoming less suitable, the answer is likely (D).\r\n\r\nAerobic respiration is a state of the organism where energy is derived from carbohydrates and oxygen. Often, the action of oxygen is limited by lung capacity, which restricts the rate of exchange of oxygen with the cells. As a result, cells begin to use carbohydrates stored in glycogen, which is a type of amino acid that transports oxygen. When anaerobic conditions are lost, the ability of cells to use oxygen increases, thus progressively becoming more suitable for cellular processes.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Given that the muscle's pH falls below 6.0, the answer is likely (B).\r\n\r\nThe pH is a measure of the overall activity of a solution, and the level of acidity or basicity of a solution affects the ability of cells to consume it. In anaerobic conditions, decaying or non-digestible carbohydrates migrate into the lungs, resulting in a decrease in pH. While in anaerobic conditions, the cells do not have the ability to utilize the special amino acids stored in glycogen, resulting in an increase in the internal pH, which falls below the phosphate-reducing threshold at 7.4.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, muscle cells can metabolize these carbohydrates more effectively when their pH is higher, and this can lead to symptoms such as cramps or nausea.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Given that the blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L, the answer is likely (C).\r\n\r\nIn scenarios where the blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L, this could be a sign of several diseases including type 2 diabetes and obesity. Diabetes insipidus is one such disease where the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas die, resulting in glucose being stored toxically in the liver. As insulin levels drop, glucose in the liver decreases and the insulin-producing cells cannot keep up. When this occurs, the cells cannot balance the required sugar and fat balance, leading to excessive bile salts and excessive glucose intake, allowing the body to be obese. In the case of obesity, blood glucose concentration can also be a predictor of type 2 diabetes and other diseases linked to high blood glucose levels. \r\n\r\nOverall, an increase in anaerobic respiration coupled with decreased muscle anaerobic capacity leads to decreased bodily fluids, such as glucose, resulting in pH decrease and diabetes. With the availability of insulin and diet modifications, there is a need to keep track of bodily fluids and manage their levels effectively to maintain a healthier lifestyle.",

            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\nThe correct answer is A (elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle).\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nAppropriate sodium bicarbonate ingestion improves the efficiency of aerobic exercise by reducing the rate of adipogenesis and improving the performance of the muscles' fat-burning pathway. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is a strong electrolyte that helps buffer oxygen in the body, creating a more efficient environment for nutrients to enter the body. This allows for faster and more complete utilization of muscle mass. Therefore, a higher NaHCO3 level is necessary for optimal performance in sports that require exercise. Excessive NaHCO3 ingestion can lead to several problems, including decreased muscle growth, hyperhidrosis, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The correct answer is that sodium bicarbonate ingestion improves the middle distance running performance from elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.",

In this case, A means triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.\r\n\r\n(B) Codons are composed of four nucleotides or bases arranged in a specific sequence. In DNA, the fourth nucleotide is the base that is added during transcription. The triplets and quadruplets are grouped together to form codons, and a sequence of codons is translated into an amino acid sequence.
