            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To estimate the yield on your investment, you will need to keep track of the car rental and rental income for each month. Based on your inputs, the car rental would be $5,000 per day, or $80,000 per month, while the daily car rental cost would be $50. To calculate the yearly rental income, you would need to multiply the daily rental costs by 365.\r\n\r\nHere's how you can calculate the yearly rental income:\r\n\r\nDaily rental cost * number of days = total rental income\r\n(50 * 365) = $18,250 per year\r\n\r\nNext, you can estimate the daily expenses for the year, assuming you spend a similar amount every day:\r\n\r\nDaily car rental cost + monthly operating expenses = daily total expenses\r\n(50 + 150) = $65 per day\r\n\r\nTo estimate the yearly expenses, you can multiply the daily expenses by 365 to get an estimate of $2,137,500:\r\n\r\n(65 * 365) = $2,137,500 per year\r\n\r\nFinally, you can calculate the yearly yield on your investment by dividing the rental income by the yearly expenses:\r\n\r\n18,250 / 2,137,500 = 0.896 or 89.6%\r\n\r\nAdding 2% for taxes and security would be a good estimate. Therefore, the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round would be 92%-95%, assuming no biases or higher-than-expected income.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Understated. Reasoning:\r\n\r\nThe fixed assets account of Arno Co. shows the merchandise that was purchased, but the balance sheet is showing the original amount that was recorded in the fixed assets. This means that there was no effect on the balance sheet or the ability to recover any capital expenses. This decision was reasonable because at the time of the inventory, the merchandise was not yet in circulation, and the purchase was not recorded as an acquisition. The merchandise was only included in the year-end physical inventory later on, and the physical inventory balance sheet was correctly included as an expense. By including the purchase as an expense, the period of uncertainty between the purchase and arrival of the merchandise is reduced, allowing for better accuracy and traceability of assets and liabilities.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements about audit sampling risks is correct for a nonissuer?\n\n(A) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n(B) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\n(C) Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\n(D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n(A) The correct answer is (A) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population. This statement is true because auditing a sample of individuals can lead to different conclusions than auditing the entire population. If the sample is representative of the population, the audit findings should be similar to the results obtained by analyzing the entire population. However, if there are natural tail-distributions or demographic effects, the audit findings may differ significantly. \r\n\r\n(B) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements. An auditor's interpretation of statements and data can be affected by misunderstandings or errors. A nonissuer may not be able to recognize these misstatements and may not take appropriate action. The risk of misinterpreting data can still exist even if an auditor is experienced and knowledgeable in the area of the audit.\r\n\r\n(C) Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. The audit sampling process is one of the principles of improving audit quality. However, there is always a possibility of error when applying audit sampling procedures. A nonissuer may not be aware of all the relevant risks and procedures, and may not correctly apply sampling procedures to these risks. This creates a risk of noncompliant audits that may not accurately reflect the risks and consequences of the audit.\r\n\r\n(D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. A nonissuer may not be knowledgeable in the area of the audit, and may not select audit procedures that are appropriate to the target of the audit. This can lead to compromised or inefficient audit findings, and may inhibit the ability to accurately determine the level of risk to the organization.\r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\n\r\n(A) The answer is TRUE.",

Bond carrying Retained amount earnings\n\n(A) Overstated Understated\n(B) Understated Overstated\n(C) Overstated No effect\n(D) No effect No effect",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nSure, I can provide you with the correct understanding of the error that occurred at Dean Co. and the effects of the error on the amounts of the bond carried interest earnings.\r\r\n\r\r\nAt Dean Co. during its first year of operation, the due date for the bond was July 1 year 12. The bond was priced at $100 with a 3% annualized face value coupon and a 50% premium matured on July 2 year 12. Therefore, the bond's present value (PV) on July 1 year 12 was $100 + $50 = $150.\r\r\n\r\r\nTo amortize the bond with the traditional straight-line method, the bond was divided into annual sub-installments of 150/3 = 50 dollars each. Each sub-installment was paid semi-annually along with accrued interest, which was charged at 3% per annum. This meant that in year 2, the bond had 50 dollars and an accrued interest of $36 annually. In year 3, the bond had 100 dollars and an accrued interest of $108 annually, and so on.\r\r\n\r\r\nHowever, in Year 7, the bond carrying interest earnings was forfeited and replaced with a new one on July 1 year 12. This meant that the new bond had a new PV of $50 because the due date for the old bond had been past due and no amount was left unpaid. The bond had an effective annual rate (EAR) of 27.02% per annum. Since the bond had been sold by Lloyds Bank before it was even due, the amortization was far from the correct method and there was a very big error in amortizing premium due to the straight-line method.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe present value (PV) of the bond carried interest earnings for the period of July 1 year 7 to June 30 year 12 was $50*8/360. If we assume that the excess capital has been sold from the bond, then the present value of the excess capital is $0. Based on this assumption, the carrying value of the bond earnings is approximately $50.\r\r\n\r\r\nTherefore, the error in amortizing premium due to the straight-line method at Dean Co. had a significant impact on the carrying value of the bond earnings.\r\r\n\r\r\nTo simplify the question, I ask you which of the following options seem correct based on the information provided?\r\r\n\r\r\n(A) Understated No effect\r\r\n(B) Understated Inflated\r\r\n\r\r\n(Explanation: The error in amortizing the bond with the traditional straight-line method had a significant impact on the carrying value of the bond earnings. This increased the carrying value of the bond earnings compared to the original carrying value, but there was no significant increase in the bond's value. As a result, the bond's carrying value remained basically the same as the original carrying value.)\r\r\n\r\r\n(C) Understated No effect\r\r\n\r\r\n(Explanation: Although the amortization of the bond had been done incorrectly, there was no significant impact on the carrying value of the bond earnings. The bond's carrying value remained the same as the original carrying value, indicating that the error had minimal impact. However, it is important to note that the bond carrying interest earnings should be sold in the same market as the new bond offered to replace it, or the cost of the new bond should be considered to mitigate any impact on the bond's value.)\r\r\n\r\r\n(D) Not applicable\r\r\n\r\r\n(Explanation: Since there was no bond earnings present throughout the year 7 to 12, there is no information on the effects of the error in amortizing premium due to the straight-line method. Moreover, the decision to sell the old bond carrying interest earnings would require more advanced economic analysis and require independent legal advice, which is beyond a single letter question.)",

            "model_answer": "The given bond has a face value of $100, a coupon rate of 5% and a yield of 6%. \r\n\r\nTo determine the price of the bond, we need to find the present value (PV) of the future cash flows (i.e., the coupon payments). The bond paying 5% coupons has a PV of: \r\n\r\nPV = p(1 + r/n)^(nt)\r\n\r\nwhere p is the bond price, r is the coupon rate, n is the number of years to the maturity, and t is the time to maturity in years.

            "model_answer": "Reasoning: \r\n\r\nA company had moved to a new building and was looking to sell an old building. Therefore, we start with the premise that the old building is being actively marketed for sale. \r\n\r\nThis can mean that there are people looking for a specific property, or it is a recent development that is being sold for a high price. It doesn't necessarily mean that the building is not being used on a regular basis, it could be a brand new construction that was completed recently. \r\n\r\nHowever, the company expects to complete the sale in four months, which is a very long time to wait. Therefore, we will assume that the old building is no longer being used and is ready to be sold. \r\n\r\nNext, we have to consider the current value of the building. If it is not reclassified as an asset held for sale, it can be either sold or depreciated or even retained as an investment. If it is classified as a current asset and is being sold, it can cause additional expenses. Therefore, we will assume that the old building is not classified as a current asset. \r\n\r\nFinally, we have to consider the historical value of the building. If it is no longer being depreciated, it could cause some concerns about its value. On the other hand, if it is being valued at its historical cost, it may not present an attractive market price or risk market losses. Therefore, we will assume that the old building is still being depreciated in order to maintain its value and protect it from any future market losses. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is: (D) The old building will be valued at historical cost.",
