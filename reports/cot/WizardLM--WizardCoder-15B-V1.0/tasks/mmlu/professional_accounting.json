            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Simplifying the problem\r\n\r\nThe monthly cost of the car is $50. \r\n\r\nStep 2: Estimate the yield per year\r\n\r\nThe car is estimated to be rented for 2 hours a day on average, so the daily rental cost is $100. To estimate the yield per year, we need to divide the total rental cost by the total number of days in the year (365) as a percentage:\r\n\r\n$100 \\div 365 \u2248 0.27%$\r\n\r\nRounding to two decimal places, this gives us a yield of about 0.27% per day, which is the daily rental cost. However, we want to know the total yield per year, so we need to add this amount to the daily cost over the course of the year:\r\n\r\n260 days x 0.27% = $68.9$\r\n\r\nRounding this to two decimal places, we get a total yield per year of $1,014.22.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Convert to annual yield\r\n\r\nSince we are working all year round, we need to estimate the car's yield per year. We can divide the daily yield by 365 to get the annual yield, which we can use to estimate the total cost of the car as of today:\r\n\r\n$1,014.22 \\div 365 \u2248 28.61%$\r\n\r\nRounding to two decimal places, this gives us an annual yield of 28.61%.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Compare the annual yield to the expected rental yield\r\n\r\nTo compare the annual yield we just calculated to the expected rental yield for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour, we need to convert the rental cost per year from a percentage to a dollar amount:\r\n\r\n$0.0245 \\times 1,000 = $24.50\r\n\r\nSubstituting $24.50$ for the annual rental yield, we get:\r\n\r\n$28.61 - 24.50 = 4.11%$\r\n\r\nSo our estimate of annual yield is higher than the expected rental yield for most wedding, ceremony and party venues.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Simplify the answer\r\n\r\nSince our estimate of annual yield is higher than the expected rental yield for most wedding, ceremony and party venues, we conclude that the car is a good investment.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Understanding the audit sampling risks can take time. Before we begin, let's clarify some definitions:\n\n1. Sampling: the process of selecting a representative sample of individuals to test.\n2. Sample: a specific subset of individuals to be audited.\n3. Auditor: the person who selects the sample, applies the audit procedures, and interprets the results.\n4. Auditee: the organization whose data is being audited.\n\nNow, to answer the question:\n\nThere are no sample or audit procedures identified for the nonissuer's inquiry. Therefore, the correct answer is (D). \n\n(D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. Non-representative sampling is common in nonissuer audits. However, non-representativity can also lead to non-representative results if the audit is not properly designed. Additionally, if the objective of the audit is not clear, then non-representativity can further complicate the audit process. The risk of non-representativity can arise from a multitude of factors, including a failure to have a sufficient sample size, a failure to ensure that the sample is representative of the population, and a failure to analyze the results carefully and to identify potential biases. As a nonissuer, it is important to understand the potential sampling risks associated with the audit before undertaking an audit.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The reasoning step-by-step for the solution is as follows:\n\n1. Determine the face value of the bond, given that it is 100.\n2. Determine the coupon rate based on the given yield of 6% and the face value $100.\n3. Divide the face value by the coupon rate to get the present value of the bond. For a bond with 5% coupons and a face value of $100, the present value can be calculated as: P = $100 / (1 + 0.05)\u00b2 = $100 \u00f7 1.0051 = $99.999.\n4. Multiply the present value by the bond yield to get the future value of the bond. For a bond with a face value of $100 and a yield of 6%, the future value can be calculated as: F = P * (1 + 0.06) = $99.999 \u00d7 (1 + 0.06) = $104.29.\n5. Calculate the price of the bond by dividing the future value by the face value. To find the price, we need to calculate the present value of the bond with 3 years remaining. Since we are not given any information about the expiration date or any other relevant details, we can assume that the bond pays its coupons until it matures at the end of the year, which is 12 months (360 days) before the final coupon payment. \n6. Therefore, the bond pays interest every month on its outstanding liabilities, making it a compound interest bond. We can therefore find the future value of the bond by multiplying its present value by the number of months remaining. \n7. Using this formula: F = PV(1+r)^n, where F is the future value, PV is the present value, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, we can calculate the future value of the bond with 3 years remaining as: F = P * (1 + 0.06) * (1 + 0.06)^(12/360) = $104.29 \u00d7 (1.06)^9 = $102.40. \n8. To find the price of the bond, we need to divide the future value by the face value. Since we are working with a three-year bond, the face value needs to be divided by 3 to get the price per year. Therefore, the price of the bond is: $102.40 \u00f7 100 = $1.024. \n\nTherefore, the price of a three-year bond (face value $100), paying 5% coupons, with a yield of 6% is $1.024.",
