            "question": "Which common public relations tactic involves sending journalists on visits to appropriate locations?\n\n(A) Media release\n(B) Media tour\n(C) Press room\n(D) Promotional days/weeks",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "We can start by considering the definition of \"appropriate location\" for this question. In general, an \"appropriate location\" depends on the attitude of the audience, the news topic, and the target audience demographics. However, for the purposes of this question, we may assume that we wish to touch on journalists who are interested in media reporting and public relations. In practice, this means that the journalists would be based in city centers with access to a variety of media outlets and influencers.\r\n\r\nNow, let's consider each tactic one by one.\r\n\r\nMedia release: This involves spreading the news widely through traditional media outlets, such as newspapers, magazines, and radio television. The release may be coupled with a press release and/or a website post, which may inform readers about the latest developments.\r\n\r\nMedia tour: This involves taking journalists to different media outlets in the city to nurture the news and engage with influential people. The tour may be guided by the editorial team or by media specialists who have the expertise to capture the attention of the target audience.\r\n\r\nPress room: This involves holding a press room at an exclusive location in the city where journalists discuss the news with the media. They may interact with local reporters and media household names.\r\n\r\nPromotional days/weeks: This involves holding promotional events throughout the city, such as street fairs, conferences, or music events. The target audience may be restricted to those who are currently interested in the topic or those who have been recently promoted.\r\n\r\nBased on these considerations, the common public relations tactic involves sending journalists on visits to appropriate locations.",

            "question": "You are the vice president of public relations for a corporation that produces a well-known brand of food products. In the Albany, New York, market, one of your products has recently been found to have some contamination. While apparently not fatal, it has given a large number of consumers severe stomach cramps and other intestinal problems. The cause has been traced back to your product, which is sold throughout the nation. Your CEO wants to know what you would advise to keep the situation from becoming a public relations disaster. What should you recommend?\n\n(A) Quickly investigate to make certain your product is definitely the cause of the illness.\n(B) Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product.\n(C) Stop sales of the product in the Albany, New York, market and issue a recall for that product.\n(D) Issue a press release to the Albany, New York, market explaining how to treat the symptoms.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1. Examining the product in question thoroughly.\r\n\r\nResponding to this question, we need to examine the product closely to determine whether it truly is the cause of the medical condition. The food product should be thoroughly evaluated for the presence of potential contamination. This could include a cultivation technique to determine whether there have been any previous transmissions of the product that occurred before the Albany market. The Albany market is possibly the first place to get the product, especially if it has not been previously contaminated.\r\n\r\nStep 2. Establishing the public perception of your company in the Albany market.\r\n\r\nWe need to test the public opinion in the Albany market to determine whether the medical condition is widespread yet. We should monitor the rate at which consumers are experiencing symptoms and make sure the symptoms are becoming more severe. If consumers do not improve, we can take action to halt future sales of the product.\r\n\r\nStep 3. Establishing the public perception of your company in other markets.\r\n\r\nWe should also assess the public perception of our company in other markets to ensure that we are not solely responsible for the medical condition experienced in the Albany market. We can do this by conducting market research in other markets to see if any of our competitors are experiencing similar symptoms.\r\n\r\nStep 4. Determining the severity of the medical condition.\r\n\r\nWe need to determine the severity of the medical condition before taking any action. Symptoms such as stomach cramps and diarrhea may seem like minor ailments, but they can be more severe in certain individuals. We should pay close attention to the symptoms and seek medical attention if we suspect any underlying disease or infection.\r\n\r\nStep 5. Communicating the situation to consumers.\r\n\r\nWe need to communicate the situation to consumers to provide them with clear information on how to treat the symptoms. We should document procedures for treating the symptoms and provide consumers with clear instructions.\r\n\r\nBased on these steps, we should recommend that you treat the situation quickly by examining your product more deeply and communicating clear information to consumers about the symptoms and treatment options. However, if the symptoms remain unattended and unresolved, we would recommend halting sales of the product in the Albany market until symptoms have subsided.",

Therefore, we cannot give an accurate answer without additional information. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the best we can say is that the BBC was created as a radio station in 1917 and chose not to broadcast programmes until 1922.
