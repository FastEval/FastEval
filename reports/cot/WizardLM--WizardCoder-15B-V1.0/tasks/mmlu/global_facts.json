            "model_answer": "We need to gather information on the prevalence of obesity among adults aged 18 to 65 years old. We can then use this information to determine the percentage of adults aged 18 to 65 years old who are overweight. The current prevalence of obesity among adults is estimated to be around 20-25%. These figures represent an increase from the 10-15% figure for adults who were overweight in 2005-2008, and an increase from around 20% for adults aged 40-49 years old among the same population.\r\n\r\nSome factors that may contribute to the increase in the proportion of overweight adults include medication use, dietary intake, age, and the presence of a family history of obesity.\r\n\r\nBased on the current data, approximately 10% of adults aged 18 to 65 years old are overweight. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the relevant components of GDP per capita in the United States in 1850: the real GDP (which includes agriculture, industry, and services) and the population. \r\n\r\nReal GDP = Gross domestic product, measured in current US dollars. \r\n- This component measures the economic output of the US, and is the sum of the national product of all sectors, plus the stock of money and goods. \r\n- GDP in 1850 was $1.67 billion. \r\n\r\nPopulation = Number of people in the US. \r\n- Population in 1850 was about 328 million. \r\n\r\nStep 2: Obtain the real GDP per capita by dividing the real GDP by the population. \r\n\r\nReal GDP per capita in the US in 1850 = $1.67 billion / 328 million = $0.0519\r\n\r\nStep 3: Adjust the real GDP per capita for inflation by multiplying it by a constant. \r\n\r\n- We need to use the adjusted dollar. The most recent price level of the USD in March 2011 was approximately $1.313 per dollar in the United States at the time. \r\n\r\nReal GDP per capita in 1850 (adjusted for inflation) = 0.0519 * (1.313 / 1.0) = 0.0532\r\n\r\nStep 4: Convert the adjusted real GDP per capita to purchasing power parity (PPP) prices by multiplying by a constant. \r\n\r\n- PPP is a standard unit of measure used to compare inequality within countries. \r\n- According to the PPP system in the year 2011, one unit of a country's purchasing power parity price is equal to the price of one unit of a common currency. \r\n- In the United States, the national purchasing power parity price was approximately $0.45 per dollar, so we can multiply the real GDP per capita by this constant to get PPP prices. \r\n\r\nPPP dollars per capita in 2011 = US$0.45 / $1.00 = $0.45\r\n\r\nFinal Step: Calculate the GDP per capita in the US in 1850, adjusted for inflation, in PPP dollars. \r\n\r\nGDP per capita in 1850, adjusted for inflation, in PPP dollars = 0.0532 * $0.45 = $0.19\r\n\r\nAnswer: (A) About $300 / (B) About $3k / (C) About $8k / (D) About $15k \r\n\r\nAnswer: (A) $300 / (B) $3k / (C) $8k / (D) $15k \r\n\r\nAnswer: (A) $300 / (B) $3k / (C) $8k / (D) $15k",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "There are multiple factors that contribute to the total energy generated by solar power in a given country. Among those are the degree of development in the country, population density, level of renewable energy resources and the competition from other sources. \n\nHowever, it is difficult to compare the energy generated by individual countries due to differences in size, inflation, and the varying capacities of different solar power plants. On the other hand, we can compare the total energy generated by solar power in countries within the same economic region and we can see which of them generated the most energy from solar sources in 2019. \n\nGenerally, Solar in the United States and China has generated more than half of the total energy generated from solar power. The difference in energy generated is due to the different levels of development and policies in these two countries. However, when we compare the energy generated by countries in different economic regions, we can see that Germany, Japan, and Brazil all generated around half of the total energy.\n\nAs discussed, we cannot compare the energy generated by individual countries due to differences in size, inflation, and the varying capacities of different solar power plants. However, we can compare the total energy generated by countries within the same economic region to understand which drives the generation of solar power. Germany, Japan, and Brazil have the largest population densities in those regions, which helps to prioritize solar power in them. However, they are also the countries that have the most competing solar sources amongst each other.",

            "question": "Controlling for inflation and PPP-adjustment, about how much did GDP per capita increase from 1950 to 2016 in Japan?\n\n(A) by 5 fold\n(B) by 10 fold\n(C) by 15 fold\n(D) by 20 fold",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand three key components of GDP per capita in Japan:\n\n1. Population: Japan's population grew from 10 million in 1911 to 13.3 million in 2016.\n\n2. Natural increase in GDP: Japan experienced a period of rapid population growth that has remained relatively constant over the past century. This natural increase in GDP per capita is due to improvements in agriculture, fisheries, and industry that have increased the productivity of the country's economy.\n\n3. Inflation: Japan experienced a notable period of economic growth, but inflation has been high in recent years. Although Japan is a low-income country, inflation has caused GDP per capita to decrease in recent years, which has pushed up recovery trends.\n\nOverall, assuming we are focusing on a single time period (1950-2016), we can tailor our argument depending on the level of inflation in Japan's economy. If we assume that Japan's inflation has remained relatively low or has moderately increased during the past decade, we may argue that GDP per capita was actually slightly lower in 2016 relative to 1950. Conversely, if we assume Japan's inflation has increased significantly, we may argue that GDP per capita increased by 20 fold over this period.\n\nIn the absence of further data, it is difficult to say which explanation is correct. However, if we want to be conservative and err on the side of caution, we can choose option A for reasons of consistency and mildly increased certainty. We might reason that during these periods of economic growth and inflation, it was common for GDP per capita to increase more than 5 fold, but it could also be reasoned that in recent years GDP per capita increased less than some baseline annual rate, which has since fallen, further raising the question of degree of inflation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, by 5 fold.",

            "correct_answer": 0,

It is one of the most common causes of infant diarrhea in rural areas because it enters the lungs before too much has developed.\r\n2. Preterm birth complications: This is one of the leading causes of infant mortality in rural areas. About 30% of newborns in developing countries experience some form of preterm labor.\r\n3. Diarrheal diseases: This is another common cause of infant mortality. It accounts for about 25% of infant deaths.\r\n4. Malaria: Malaria is also a common cause of infant mortality.

The answer is not specific to any country, region, or type of population. \r\n\r\nNext, let's consider the definition of drinking water: safe drinking water is a water quality standard that ensures that each person can safely consume a minimum level of essential nutrients and fluids. Drinking water with safe quality is essential for human well-being and survival, and inadequate drinking water may lead to some diseases such as diabetes, respiratory infections, and cardiovascular diseases. \r\n\r\nIt is essential to ensure that every individual has access to safe drinking water, but not everyone in the world can afford it. According to UNICEF estimate, about 20% of the world's population does not have access to safe drinking water because of lack of access to safe sources, such as well-maintained water supply systems and adequate sanitation and hygiene. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer is 20% of the global population. \r\n\r\nTherefore, (B) 20% is the correct answer.",

Based on the available data, the fraction of the population who used internet in the past three months in India can vary. It could be anywhere between 10% to 60% based on factors such as access to internet, willingness to use it, and the availability of fiber optic cables and broadband infrastructure in the country. \n\nBased on the provided data, the fraction of the population who used internet in the past three months in India varies. The public consumption of internet has reached critical mass in India and is expected to grow further in the coming years. However, given the rapid pace of expansion in our country, it is critical to have a sound internet infrastructure to maintain a healthy internet usage pattern. A large proportion of the population in India has access to internet through smartphones, tablets, and laptops, which makes it essential to ensure that they have access to fast, reliable and secure internet connectivity.\n\nTo help make accurate and reliable internet data available to decision-makers, various sources such as internet maps, census data, and other government institutions have been established. These sources are crucial for understanding the distribution of internet access across the country and identifying areas where internet access is scarce or unreliable. Census data on internet usage could also help identify regions with low or moderate internet usage, where further investment or infrastructure development is required to ensure adequate access to internet. In conclusion, based on the provided data, the fraction of the population who used internet in the past three months in India is between 10% to 60% and can vary depending on factors such as access to internet, willingness to use it, and other factors such as internet infrastructure in the country.",
