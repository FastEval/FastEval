            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nA) int() function is used to convert a string to integer in Python. It works by taking a string as its argument, and converting it to an integer, if it is possible. It takes an optional second argument 'base' which is used to specify the base of the input string if it is represented in another base system, such as hexadecimal or binary.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> int('100')\r\n100\r\n>>> int('200', 16)\r\n512\r\n>>> int('10101', 2)\r\n21\r\n```\r\n\r\nB) long() function is used to convert a string to long integer in Python. It works similar to the int() function, but returns a long integer, which can store larger integers than normal integers. The function takes a string as its only argument and returns a long integer object.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> long('10000000000000000000000000000000')\r\n100000000000000000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nC) float() function is used to convert a string to floating point number in Python. It takes a string as its argument and returns a floating point number object.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> float('3.14')\r\n3.14\r\n>>> float('1.0e-10')\r\n1e-10\r\n```\r\n\r\nD) str() function is used to convert a number to string in Python. It takes an object as its argument and returns the string representation of that object.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> str(123)\r\n'123'\r\n>>> str(3.14)\r\n'3.14'\r\n>>> str(True)\r\n'True'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the correct answer is (A) int(x [,base]) as it is used to convert a string to integer in Python.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer depends on several factors, such as programming paradigms, programming language used, libraries used, complexity of the program, and hardware resources available. The specific question asks about the ability of the program to process larger data sets, which may involve different factors depending on the context. However, it is generally considered to be most likely affected by the hardware resources available, especially the amount of memory and storage. Depending on the program, factors such as complexity and programming statements may also affect the overall performance. If the program requires a specific programming paradigm or language, that may also have an impact on performance, especially for larger data sets. The programmer should also consider how the program will be run, whether it will be on a local machine or on a distributed system with multiple processors, and whether the hardware resources will be shared between multiple programs. Overall, the most likely factor to affect the program's ability to process larger data sets is the hardware resources, specifically memory and storage, as they are often the bottleneck in terms of performance.",
