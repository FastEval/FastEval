            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Letter A is correct. States exercise jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels in the coastal States. \r\n\r\nTo address letter B, it is assumed that the State that signifies by the flag is the State that exercises jurisdiction in respect of such crimes. However, the flag can only be a regional symbol and this does not mean that such State exercises jurisdiction. Therefore, it is best to simply ask the question for all States to clarify if such a distinction can be made.\r\n\r\nLetter C is also correct as it entirely depends on the nature of the crime. It is common for all States to have jurisdiction in some form for certain types of crimes, such as war crimes or terrorism. However, jurisdiction can also be limited under certain circumstances, such as if there is a conflict of interest or if the crime involves a personal matter.\r\n\r\nTo address letter D, this is not a State that exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels. Furthermore, it is not a part of the UN Convention on International Trade in Goods.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders. This means that in cases where a certain right is violated, such as in cases of infringement on a copyright, the law provides a mechanism for determining who should be held accountable for the violation and what damages should be awarded to the violators. This mechanism is called \"fundamental justice,\" as it is deeply rooted in fundamental principles of human rights and the law. It is the result of well-designed, fair, and impartial enforcement procedures. The justiciability is guaranteed by the Supreme Court's vision of human rights as a fundamental right that must not be discriminated against unless the discrimination is \"unreasonable\" or \"unlawful\".\r\n\r\nAnswer:(C)",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Answer: (B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress. R2P is not a humanitarian intervention, rather it is a state action to assist the country in times of distress while striving to maintain peace and stability. It is the result of the efforts of the military and civilian forces within the country to respond to situations that require more than simple medical care, such as incidents of natural disasters where people are trapped, refugees entering hostile territories, and crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. These efforts are crucial in continuing the humanitarian and peace occupation of the country.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Possible Reasoning for Answer:\r\n\r\nA - The UK Constitution says that the power to create laws is vested in the sovereign state. Given the power source given to the judiciary, it is implied that the judiciary can not overturn the laws and should be viewed with suspicion. If the judiciary had the power to overturn laws, then it could create a conflict of interest within the society and could cause harm to the country.\r\n\r\nB - The UK Constitution gives the judiciary the power to overturn acts of parliament as not having the power to pass laws. Moreover, in the UK, the judiciary is given veto power so that they cannot block legislation during an assembly.\r\n\r\nC - The UK Constitution is an uncodified document that is effectively kept a secret. It is highly unlikely that any complete version of the UK Constitution can be found in a wider range of sources. It is also difficult to find legal precedents compared to other countries.\r\n\r\nD - The UK Constitution is based on a Bill of Rights which is a set of principles that are fundamental to the rights of all people. However, it is important to note that the UK Constitution cannot be considered a purely Bill of Rights document since it also has other provisions for creating an imperative to create a commonwealth.",

This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes\n(C) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute\n(D) It is an obligation which concerns solely international courts and tribunals",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Because Protocol 14 changed the number of judges responsible for admissibility hearings from three to one judge, it is a false statement. The one judge formation is consistent with international orthodoxy. It was only when Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility that the three judge formation was adopted. Yet even then, any recommendations made by the Council could be upheld by other institutions, not just the Council itself. Finally, Protocol 14's abolition of the Commission of Human Rights would not result in any form of censorship, contrary to widely held principles regarding human rights.",

            "question": "Which is a 'rock' under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)?\n\n(A) Rocks are the islands that are less than 10 square miles\n(B) Rocks are the islands that do not have any maritime zone\n(C) Rocks are the islands which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and according to article 121 (3) have no Exclusive Economic Zone or continental shelf.\n(D) Rocks are the small islands that can sustain human habitation",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nUnder UNCLOS, 'rock' is an overarching term that encompasses various kinds of natural features such as salt lakes, bedrock, and glaciers to name a few. The UNCLOS explains that conceptually, 'rock' is a natural phenomenon that lies outside the earth\u2019s crust and is characterized by its properties of density, durability, resistance to disturbances, and resistance to erosion due to gravity.\r\n\r\nOne property that differentiates certain types of 'rock' from the other is the impermeability to physical forces that it possesses. Rocks are susceptible to pressure, tremor, and sliding but they can remain firmly attached to the solid earth with no resistance to disturbances. This property is essential in creating areas of refuge and natural havens that provide legitimacy to individuals and nations residing within them.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the answer D is the correct answer. It is implied that this is different from (A) and (B) by referring to the critical distance of 10 square miles. Additionally, it indicates that the islands are small, and not inhabited by humans. This is a positive indicator of being non-habitable.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nThe island does not sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and according to article 121 (3) have no Exclusive Economic Zone or continental shelf but it does have a small population relative to other islands in the UNCLOS. It therefore fits the definition of 'rock' under UNCLOS. \r\n\r\n(D) Rocks are the small islands that can sustain human habitation.",
