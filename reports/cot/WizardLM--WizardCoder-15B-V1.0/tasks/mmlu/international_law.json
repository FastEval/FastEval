            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The reasoning behind this question is to identify what is meant by \"ordinarily\" and \"jurisdiction\" in the context of the question provided. In the answer to this question, there are four possible options: Coastal State, Flag State, All States, and International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. \n\nThe first option, \"The coastal State,\" refers to a state located in the shoreline of a body of water and responsible for protecting and promoting the law-abiding behavior of the inhabitants. \n\nThe second option, \"The flag State,\" refers to a state that is designated by a particular country or organization as a \"representative of that country,\" often as a means of establishing mutual understanding and cooperation among members of a region. \n\nThe third option, \"All States enjoy such jurisdiction,\" refers to the absence of a standardized law by any particular country or organization that requires it to exercise jurisdiction over certain crimes on board vessels. \n\nThe fourth option, \"The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea,\" refers to a body created by treaties in which certain laws and standards can be enforced both on land and in the ocean. \n\nBased on this information, the correct answer to this question is option B, which is \"The flag State.\" The flag State is designated by a particular country or organization as a \"representative of that country,\" but does not have the power to enforce a standardized law over certain crimes on board vessels. Therefore, the \"ordinarily\" component in this context does not apply.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "According to Lotus (McClintock), the hypothesis that restrictions upon the independence of States are not valid or have been violated holds true. The Lotus principle states that what is not prohibited is permitted. But it also emphasizes the difference between customary law and enforcement law. Customary law is a law that is passed by the courts of the States, while enforcement law is law that is applied to enforce a dispute. This is because customary law is more suited to the purposes of the State and the circumstances of the dispute, while enforcement law is more suited to protect the rights and freedoms of all. \n\nTo illustrate, customary law is the highway code, which is a set of rules that all states follow to travel on their highways. When there is a dispute over a particular issue, there is likely to be a trial in the courts, where the parties can prove their case and attempt to resolve the issue. Enforcement law is more focused on protecting people's fundamental human rights. A knife in a glove is a clear example of customary law being used over enforcement law in sports. \n\nIn conclusion, the 'Lotus principle' is a natural extension of the Law of Treaty of the Non-Proliferation and the Integrity of the States. It argues that there may be no absence of restrictions on the independence of States, but they are not always binding. The principle also suggests that customary law and enforcement law may have different purposes and that, to the extent possible, a balance must be maintained between the two. In this case, customary law is used to promote competition and cooperation between States, while enforcement law is used to protect fundamental human rights.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The best description of the UK Constitution is A- The UK Constitution\u2019s only source of power is that of the sovereign. \r\n\r\nAs the national executive, the UK has absolute autonomy to establish and enforce the rules of law. Despite this, the Constitution provides that all authorities and institutions should consult, adopt, and repeal legislation as it sees fit. This ensures that no one group of powers dominates the Constitution or overturns its judgments.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the Constitution\u2019s immutability and equal protection of all its members, the UK Parliament must be empowered to overturn acts of parliament through a vote of the majority of members present. This ensures that the government has the power to protect basic human rights.\r\n\r\nThe UK Constitution is not codified and cannot be found in a single source. Instead, it is a body of law that is derived from a range of diverse sources, including the writings of different states, the courts, and the various groups within the parliament. This means that the Constitution is a living text that can undergo significant changes over time.\r\n\r\nThe UK Constitution is also based on a Bill of Rights, which is a series of principles that set out the fundamental freedoms enjoyed by all human beings. This ensures that the UK Constitution protects these rights and that no challenge to them can be raised.",

This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes\n(C) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute\n(D) It is an obligation which concerns solely international courts and tribunals",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes is an obligation of peace in international relations that states have a legal right to fulfill. It is one of the fundamental principles of international law and places the obligation of peace on the side of the states to resolve their disputes peacefully. \r\n\r\nHowever, not all peaceful settlements of disputes are obligations of result. On the other hand, some states may have other responsibilities that require peaceful settlements, but these responsibilities do not result in a net gain for them. States that have an obligation to conduct their disputes through peaceful means are not obligated to settle their disputes that way, and instead may resolve their disputes through traditional means, such as arbitration or mediation. \r\n\r\nIn either case, all peaceful settlements of disputes are deemed peremptory in the sense that they require an outright adjudication by the relevant international institutions. This means that settlements do not have to happen in a predetermined time frame. The peremptory nature of peaceful settlements also implies that the parties involved in the dispute must exercise their right to self-determination to meet the obligations imposed by the peaceful settlement of disputes. \r\n\r\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes is a fundamental principle of international law, as it ensures that all parties involved in international disputes have a meaningful choice when facing each other. However, in some cases, the requirement for peaceful settlement of disputes may be inconsistent with other legal obligations of states. For example, in some jurisdictions, the requirement to peacefully resolve disputes may be subject to the right to communicate and cooperate, which requires peaceful settlements to be flexible enough to accommodate those interests.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider that in each case the ECHR had different decisions and laws made before Protocol 14. Therefore, it is impossible for any one of these statements to be false. Without any context, we cannot determine which one to believe as true.\r\n\r\nHowever, we can begin by examining the two most recent decisions made by the ECHR. Protocol 13 (1996) overturned the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) that had been declared illegal by the Council of Europe in 1974. It did this by establishing a House of Assembly that judges cases on all grounds that are applicable to women's human rights, not just sex discrimination.\r\n\r\nProtocol 15 (2000) enacted a new anti-discrimination law in the European Court of Human Rights that bars discrimination based on age, gender, race, or religion in certain public employment contexts. It also requires disparate impact assessment if involving trans\u4eba\u7684human beings.\r\n\r\nTo try to solve the question, we need to consider that the circumstances of each case could also have a significant impact on its decision. For example, Protocol 13 was discussed in the European Court of Human Rights Committee that recommended that it be compared with the impact of the CEDAW and other cases that have been decided since the convention, including those made before the entry into force of Protocol 13. Another example would be Protocol 15, which was discussed in the Committee on the Law of Human Rights (CLHR). This Committee recommended that it be considered in light of the recent history of discriminatory actions in public employment scenarios and the implementation of gender-based discrimination policies in various sectors.\r\n\r\nOverall, none of these decisions and laws can be considered as false, because they have come into effect after the entry into force of Protocol 13 and 15. Therefore, we cannot infer which of the four statements to believe is true based on these considerations alone.",
