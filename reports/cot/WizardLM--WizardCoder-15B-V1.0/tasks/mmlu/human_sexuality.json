If it is arranged in a different way, we need to identify it specifically. \r\n\r\nBased on the given information, it is not clear whether (B) vary for women depending on the phases of the menstrual cycle refers to the way the regions are arranged, or whether it refers to the different ways in which women can experience sexual excitement during the menstrual cycle. \r\n\r\nWithout further information, it is difficult to determine whether (C) the lower portion of the body refers to the abdominal cavity or the region closest to the abdomen. If (C) refers to the lower portion of the abdomen, we cannot determine (D) the region is on all of the above. If (C) refers to the abdominal cavity, then the answer would be (A). This assumes that the regions vary in size, shape, or position, but does not specifically identify which regions are included in this category. \r\n\r\nAnswer:The answer would be (D), since the regions vary from person to person, women can experience sexual excitement based on the phases of the menstrual cycle, and they all reside on the lower portion of the body.",

            "question": "Which of the following is/are true of gonorrhea?\n\n(A) can be treated with antibiotics\n(B) has a high risk of infection with a single exposure\n(C) is asymptomatic (without symptoms) in only a small percentage of those infected\n(D) infections are limited to genital areas",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the main symptom of gonorrhea:\r\n\r\nGonorrhea is a chronic bacterial infection that usually affects the female genital area (bottom part of her uterus). The inflammation occurs due to the irritation of the skin cells. It commonly affects the skin and can cause redness, swelling, warmth, and red spots that may be painful. These symptoms are usually sudden and last for several hours, although they may last longer in severe cases. Blood, urine, and sweating may also be impaired.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Determine if the main symptom is caused by bacteria:\r\n\r\nThe most common cause of gonorrhea is the bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, other bacteria can also cause this symptom.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Determine if the infection is due to a single exposure or multiple exposures:\r\n\r\nGonorrhea can be caused either by a single or multiple exposures to the female genital area. A single infection at the most is rare and usually due to contamination during sex. Multiple infections usually occur within a year, although some patients experience few to no symptoms.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Determine the stage of the infection:\r\n\r\nThe stage of the infection can range from asymptomatic to severe. Typically, patients with severe cases have chills, seizures, coma, and death.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Determine the presence of other symptoms:\r\n\r\nOther symptoms of gonorrhea can include nausea, vomitting, and recurrent skin infections. Some patients experience dry mouth and/or conjunctivitis.\r\n\r\nStep 6: Determine if the infection can be treated:\r\n\r\nGonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics such as vancomycin or ciprofloxacin in certain cases. The use of a steroid such as prednisone may also be considered in severe cases.\r\n\r\nTherefore: (D) infections are limited to genital areas can be treated with antibiotics and has a high risk of infection with a single exposure.",

            "question": "You are a homosexual male: Last night, you were tempted by lusty, swarthy Jacques (the king of fraternity row) to join him at the local dairy bar for a tall cool glass of milk. You also briefly considered studying for this test, but Jacques won out. In Freudian terms, which of the following was dominant?\n\n(A) the id\n(B) the ego\n(C) the superego\n(D) the Oedipus complex",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Homosexuality:\r\nSince you are a homosexual male, lust is a dominant sexual desire and thus you are also attracted to strong, powerful, and dominant women due to your sexuality. Thus, Jacques is a strong, powerful, and dominant individual.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Relative power:\r\nHence, the dominant individual in this scenario is Jacques, as he brings out a strong, powerful, and dominant individual in all his interactions. Furthermore, Jacques' dominant power and flexibility allows him to attract a higher level of attention and thus complexion than a passive observer.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Identifying:\r\nIn Freudian terms, identifying means understanding who others are and what they are doing. Therefore, Jacques's ability to be flexible, his willingness to change, and his brilliance allows him to easily identify with his impulses and desires, giving him unfettered power over various aspects of his life.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Temptation:\r\nYou were tempted by Jacques to join him at the dairy bar. This prompt the question of where temptation comes from and how it was presented. Temptation can be the result of various motives, but it is always a response to desire. Jacques's charm, sweetness, attention to detail, and ability to be swayed by his desires or actions were enough to tempt you.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Jacques didn't won out due to the female's outspoken nature. This leaves open the question of why Jacques didn't take your temptation. One possible reason could be that Jacques is a female and thus you were expecting a more confident and assertive response from a male dominant individual. Additionally, Jacques was also interested in pursuing a higher level of education and maturity, leading to his rejection of your desire to join him.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Jacques was a powerful, dominant individual and you were tempted by him to join his dairy bar. Jacques' dominant potential gives him unfettered power over your daily activities and growth as a person. Since Jacques was weak in terms of self-esteem and appearance, he was rejected by you, who felt that his dominant nature and assertion could not match up with your lust for authority and power.",

            "question": "According to a study by Sprecher, Barbee, and Schwartz (1995), women were more likely than men to have ________ following their first act of intercourse.\n\n(A) felt glad\n(B) felt fear\n(C) experienced guilt\n(D) experienced regret",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "We can reason this using four different keywords: \"felt\", \"feel\", \"feeling\", and \"pleasure\". Firstly, we need to know the context in which this statement was made. The study conducted in 1995 was a survey conducted on a large scale, which was done to \"examine\" attitudes and intentions of women and men towards social and sexual interaction from birth to death. Therefore, we can assume that the participants in this study made an \"initial decision\" about sexuality, and they were given a choice to decide on their sexual orientation at birth or later. \r\n\r\nSecondly, we can look at the factor involved in women choosing to have their \"first act of intercourse\" (\"felt\", \"feel\", \"feeling\", or \"pleasure\"). This factor can be psychological, cultural, or environmental. Psychological factors like \"feelings\" or \"emotions\" can lead to anxiety or rejection, while cultural factors like the perception of the other person as \"culturally appropriate\" can lead to a rejection of the idea of sex. Environmental factors like the nature and amount of time that the other person is exposed to during the first act of intercourse can also influence their preferences.\r\n\r\nFinally, we can look at the gender of the lactating mother, who is the one that begins the sexual intercourse process. This can have an impact on whether they feel the warmth or the sensation of guilt or regret after their first act. As women with more pre-marital experience are often more involved in their sexuality, they are more likely to feel the initial sensation of warmth and satisfaction from their interaction. \r\n\r\nGiven this information, we can infer that Women were more likely than men to have felt regret following their first act of intercourse. Therefore, the answer is (D) experienced regret.",

            "question": "What is cocaine abuse during pregnancy related to?\n\n(A) an increased risk of low birth weight babies\n(B) poorer growth and lower intelligence\n(C) smaller head circumference\n(D) all of the above",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nMost commonly, Cocaine abuse during pregnancy is related to a higher risk of an early premature birth, due to the intense psychological and physical effects with cocaine use. This can lead to psychotic mood swings, drug withdrawal, and behavioral changes such as withdrawal and excessive penetration into the newborn. A smaller head circumference can also potentially cause cocaine withdrawal affecting the ability of the mother to deliver a healthy baby.\r\n\r\nAs for the other concerns mentioned, cocaine abuse during pregnancy can cause lower intelligence in newborns as the negative emotions produced by cocaine can have the opposite effect on the development of both mother and newborn. Prolonged cocaine use can also negatively impact on the fetus development by causing premature birth and low birth weight.\r\n\r\nOverall, Cocaine abuse during pregnancy can lead to a range of medical complications that include growth retardation, psychotic symptoms, and lower birth weight. The benefits of prevention and others mentioned earlier such as taking probiotics and high-concentration cocaine can all contribute to lowering the risk and improving overall health for both mother and baby. Therefore, D is an accurate answer. \r\n\r\nNote: \"High-concentration\" cocaine refers to cocaine containing over 50 mg per 100 ml, and is a common major risk factor for cocaine abuse during pregnancy.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n1. Participation in \"play\" could refer to a wide range of activities including everything from sports to books, movies, to art.\r\n\r\n2. Usually male-typical or female-typical play would refer to the gender roles played in the play or within the community.\r\n\r\n3. Bruce and Chuck are both men which implies that they have the same gender identity.\r\n\r\n4. Bruce likely participated in more female-typical play than Chuck based on his sexuality, occupation, and family background.\r\n\r\n5. Bruce's family has more homosexual tendencies than Chuck's family.\r\n\r\n6. Based on the reasoning above, we can conclude that Bruce's narrative of female-dominated play might have influenced his friend Chuck's narrative of male-dominated play. \r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\n\r\n(B) Bruce's gender identity was at play throughout his childhood and adolescence. Therefore, he may have been more likely to develop a higher degree of homosexuality and negativity. This could prove detrimental to Chuck, who is relatively more conservative in his behavior, making it difficult for them to appreciate his potential. Meanwhile, Chuck may have been more directed and spontaneous in his behavior, seeming more sympathetic and accepting of his potential.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Inherently evil: Judaism heavily values sexuality as a natural and intrinsic part of human nature. It has denied any form of relationship that is input or output, or involves any other mode of communication other than love. Men and women have no choice but to resort to physical action to achieve desirable sexuality and no compromise, including divorce, occurs without a properly informed decision. Additionally, Jews and Christians who choose to reject this truth risk becoming sex slaves and generating economic instability.\n\n(A) They seem to have severe sexist attitudes towards other people's sexuality and have a strong inbuilt hatred towards sexual practices. This includes denying that sex is a fundamental human and biological function and believing that it is always encouraged, even when it may not be. Jews and Christians who deny such fundamental sexuality, undermine their faith in the Holy Ghost, the safety and well-being of others.\n\n(B) Judaism has become an aberration in the eyes of many religious leaders and politicians. They reject God's teachings and are constantly looking for ways to justify their ideas. Their beliefs, practices, and attitudes are often incompatible with canonical Jewish beliefs and practice. Many follow Judaism at odds with Christianity, claiming that they are inherently sinful and may cause a terrible destruction to the Jewish nation. Jews are also being prosecuted for committing Judaism-related offenses.\n\n(C) Sexuality and romantic love is a deeply personal and sacred aspect of Judaism. It is part of the cultural identity of the Jewish people and a core part of Jewish ethics. Men and women seek to grow in understanding of one another, learn from the experience, and deepen their friendships. Sexuality is a deep spiritual journey that involves longing, love, acceptance, commitment, and discipline. The God who created love is the source of all good in the world. Jews and Christians confess that they have encountered disappointment in their attempts to dedicate themselves to God's will for other people. However, the Holy Ghost remains with us to guide us and strengthen our relationship with God and each other.\n\n(D) Judaism regards sexuality as only a biological function and rejects any attempt by women to encode or decode it. Men, women, and children often become sexually active through work, play, and self-expression. Judaism rejects the idea that sexuality has any physical or material basis. Men and women are encouraged to seek out love, acceptance, and commitment from the God of love, whether it is a virgin or a past partner. Judaism values the idea of a material nature of love, but rejects the idea that love may be permanent or disappear over time.",
