            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\n\nTo detect breast cancer, patients often receive various tests and procedures, such as mammograms, (D), and ultrasonography, (C). \n\nMammography is a non-invasive examination technique used to diagnose breast cancer that involves the breast being punctured in specific areas and examined on film. Mammograms can be done on a monthly or bi-monthly basis and are typically done at least every six months. These images are often referred to as 'breast mammograms'. \n\nNo method of detecting breast cancer involves exposure to radiation. (C) is methodically safe, and there are no significant risks to breast cancer that are associated with external radiation. \n\nTherefore, the method of detecting breast cancer that involves exposure to radiation is (B), mammography. \n\nAnswer:M or (B)",

            "question": "The regions of the body that, when touched, are sexually exciting:\n\n(A) vary from person to person\n(B) vary for women depending on the phases of the menstrual cycle\n(C) are mainly on the lower portion of the body\n(D) all of the above",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "A. Regions of the body that are sexually exciting vary from person to person.\n\nExplanation: This answer is correct as different regions of the body can be sensitive to different chemical stimuli. As long as sexual fantasies can be pursued, the region of the body that is sexually exciting is more varied than just one region.\n\nB. Regions of the body vary for women depending on the phases of the menstrual cycle.\n\nExplanation: This answer is also correct as the region of the body that is sexually exciting for women depends on the menstrual cycle. It is important to recognize that menstruation is not a one-time event for all women, but rather a regular part of their menstrual cycle. It is important to keep tabs on any different regions of the body that are sensitive to these chemicals, as this can lead to unexpected and unpredictable outcomes. \n\nC. Regions of the body that are mainly on the lower portion of the body are sexually exciting.\n\nExplanation: This answer is partially correct. Some regions of the body, such as the feet, are particularly sensitive to sexual stimuli. However, it is important to note that other regions of the body, such as the hands and mouth, may also be sensitive to sexual stimuli. Therefore, it is essential to be mindful of these different regions when creating sexual fantasies.  \n\nD. All of the above.\n\nExplanation: This answer is also correct as all of the regions mentioned in the previous answers are considered to be sexually exciting. However, it is important to note that sexual fantasies can be more seductive and trigger more physiological responses if the region of the body that is being targeted is also acting as a recipient of those stimuli.",

            "question": "You are a homosexual male: Last night, you were tempted by lusty, swarthy Jacques (the king of fraternity row) to join him at the local dairy bar for a tall cool glass of milk. You also briefly considered studying for this test, but Jacques won out. In Freudian terms, which of the following was dominant?\n\n(A) the id\n(B) the ego\n(C) the superego\n(D) the Oedipus complex",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Evaluating the reasoning: \r\nProtagonist: Jacques (the king of fraternity row) is an intelligent, swarthy lady with rings on her fingers. She is highly gifted and proficient in the art of tactical strategy. On the other side, protagonist: you, a homosexual male, is also highly gifted and proficient in the art of tactical strategy. Jacques is the fairest and most pure of the two, while you is golden age of romance. Her smiles are infectious and gorgeous, her charms amaze even the most intimidating opponents. You are also sweet-talking, charismatic, and shrewd in Deception games, making you an acknowledged and trusted partner in general. You are also a true deceiver, hoping to win over your enemy by deception. \r\n\r\nYou both need to win over lust, desire, and feminine power. You also need to combine the two for the best possible outcome in this crucial moment. However, don\u2019t let yourself get carried away with your insecurities and underestimate your opponent. \r\n\r\nJacques, a lady of her fortune, is the perfect partner in this situation. Jacques is gorgeous, swarthy, strong, and has a ton of energy. Jacques has shown immense prowess in charming and winning over her opponents. Jacques is also a strong and confident individual, always holding herself to a high standard of moral conduct. Jacques has already won over many strong adversaries, and her deception games have proven to be quite effective in stealing their secrets. \r\n\r\nEven through all this, you realize that you still have a long way to go towards your goal. You have to convince your swarthy fianc\u00e9e to lend a hand in your defence. You also need to show the people of the dairy bar that you are genuine and dedicated to your cause. You need to prove that your life is truthful and humble before your enemies. \r\n\r\nBased on this, your choice of the dominant factor within the Oedipus complex lies in the Oedipus complex itself, where your ego is the dominant force. You are more rooted in your id and most likely your current identity is somewhat swayed by your actions in the past. You have put your career and past in the background by attempting to fulfil your endeavours towards your goal. \r\n\r\nHowever, by focusing on your ego, you are likely to lose the bigger picture. You are likely to ignore your superego and pursue your lust for lust. This could lead to a false sense of security and could result in a disappointment in the long run. In the end, you could suffer a sense of isolation, boredom, and powerlessness. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the dominant force within the Oedipus complex lies in the ego itself. \r\n\r\nSo the answer to the question \"Which of the following was dominant?\" would be: (D) the Oedipus complex. \r\n\r\nStep 2: Outputting the answer: (D) the Oedipus complex.",

            "question": "Sociobiologists believe that there are more males than females with paraphilias because:\n\n(A) paraphilias guarantee survival of the species\n(B) evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli\n(C) of left brain/right brain differences between the genders\n(D) male brains are better developed than are female brains",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "We can answer this question step-by-step. \r\n\r\nFirst, paraphilias do not guarantee survival of the species. Paraphilias are not genetic diseases, but rather psychological trances that are often characterized by variations in the way one person expresses their emotions. Paraphilia can be a symptom of any mental disorder or mood disorder and it is completely normal for paraphilic individuals to experience temporary loss of self-esteem. \r\n\r\nSecond, evolutionary selection is only one possible explanation. The selection pressure acting on male nature may have been released due to their ability to respond to novel sexual stimuli. \r\n\r\nThird, we cannot determine the gender of the patient based on left brain/right brain differences. The left and right brains do not differ in function or information processing and there is no conclusive evidence that left-handed people develop better brains than right-handed people. In addition, left-handedness is not a characteristic that can reliably be used as a marker for genetic differences. \r\n\r\nFourth, because male brains are better developed than female brains, female paraphilias are likely to be evolutionary favourites. However, while females may also engage in paraphilias, their occurrence is at a lower frequency compared to males. Therefore, paraphilias are not a dominant feature of female nature compared to male nature.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sociobiologists believe that there are more males than females with paraphilias because of evolutionary selection resulting from sexual responses to novel stimuli and the paraphilic nature of female psychology. \r\n\r\n(C) of left brain/right brain differences between the genders.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Cocaine Abuse During Pregnancy is Poorer Growth and Lower Intelligence.\n\nCocaine abuse during pregnancy can negatively affect children\u2019s overall development and well-being. Once they\u2019ve had an abortion, many women become dependent on cocaine to provide quality care. From their experience, it can be difficult to correct or change their behavior as they struggle with the effects of cocaine abuse. \n\nStep 2: Cocaine Abuse During Pregnancy Can also Cause Achievement Deficiencies.\n\nDespite attention to the risk of cocaine abuse during pregnancy, many women still have potential to experience achievement deficiencies that can impact their futures. Achievement deficiencies, such as a lack of motivation, poor self-esteem, and inability to challenge unrealistic expectations can negatively impact women\u2019s mental health and overall well being. \n\nStep 3: Cocaine Abuse During Pregnancy Can Also Cause Higher Chances of Maternal Deprivation and Increased Risk of Low Birth Weight of Babies.\n\nWomen who have had cocaine abuse during pregnancy can also face a higher risk of maternal depression and an increased risk of low birth weight babies. The environment can also impact women\u2019s perceptions of their own abilities and potential, placing an even higher burden on the woman to have a good quality of life. \n\nOverall, the answer is D (all of the above).",

            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nBruce is a homosexual man, but is he participating in more male-typical or female-typical play? \r\n\r\nSince Bruce is a homosexual man and his friend Chuck is a heterosexual man, we cannot assume that they have similarities in their behavior towards women, as individuals may have different sexualities. Therefore, we do not know what Bruce is doing or feeling compared to Chuck. In other words, we cannot compare Bruce and Chuck's behavior towards women in this scenario. \r\nThe scenario suggests that Bruce is a parent who is the child and behavior of Bruce's reaction towards women could be related to the parents' attitude, as in this scenario, Bruce's father could potentially have homosexual tendencies. This is why we might expect Bruce to most likely do more male-typical play than Chuck. \r\n\r\nHence, we can conclude that Bruce's behavior towards women is more male-typical than Chuck's behavior towards women, and therefore, Bruce is more likely to participate in more male-typical play than Chuck. \r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\n\r\n(B)",

            "question": "Judaism regards sexuality as\n\n(A) inherently evil\n(B) God's afterthought and has become an aberration\n(C) a gift from God\n(D) primarily a biological function",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\nJudaism regards sexuality as a fundamental aspect of human existence. It is a fundamental right of all human beings. The role of sexuality is a part of the Godhead, and is designed to fulfill the divine function of asexual reproduction by enabling a person to be identified with their personal self as well as to ensure that all participants in a marriage are treated the same way.\n\nHowever, in pagan and secular traditions, there is a fundamental distinction between sexually transmitted diseases and genetic diseases. One of the most famous examples of the latter is the homosexual epidemic, which is defined by the need of rejecting the notion that homosexuality is natural. Another example is the difference in treatment of genital warts and genital cancer.\n\nThe social and cultural beliefs of Judaism differ from the norms of Christianity in terms of feeling attracted to sexuality. Jews believe that sexuality is good and food is valuable, while Christians hold that it is a burden and jealousy. In addition, the follower of Judaism is tempered and disciplined, making it difficult for them to indulge in all forms of sexuality.\n\nIn summary, Judaism regards sexuality as an essential aspect of human existence and is a significant part of the Godhead. However, it should not be limited to being committed to one side of the issue. The social and cultural climate of Judaism must be considered when determining the treatment of genetic diseases and homosexuality. However, the ethical dilemmas continue to exist, which is why Judaism still remains at the forefront of our understanding of sexuality.",
