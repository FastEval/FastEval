Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 6x^2 + 4x + 6. \r\n\r\n(B) It is not possible to determine the polynomial ring in Python or SageMath to create a polynomial ring in Z_8[x] because SageMath considers the number of digits as the exponent for higher degrees of the polynomial which would make our calculations more complex.\r\n\r\n(C) The answer is impossible to determine because using the definition of the product of two polynomials, one cannot divide out a zero term unless the zero term is the first term of the polynomial. In this case, f = 4x - 5 and g = 2x^2 - 4x + 2, and f/g = 2x - 3. However, 0 cannot be factored into 2x-3.
