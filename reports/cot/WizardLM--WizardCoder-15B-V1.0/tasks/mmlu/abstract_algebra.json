A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.\n\n(A) $\\lambda$-group: A factor group of a non-Abelian group is not necessarily $\\lambda$-group. The state $\\lambda$ might not be a group of allowed states but rather a certain set of eigenstates. (For instance, a diagonal state $\\lambda$ corresponding to the eigenvectors of the Hermitian operator <$H>$. However, the group of allowed states might also be Abelian. For example, if $\\lambda$ is the group of all $2\\times2$ matrices with determinant 1, then the allowed states are the $2\\times2$ matrices with determinant equal to 1, i.e., the $2\\times2$ identity matrix. We can then say that the diagonal $\\lambda$-state is $\\lambda = \\mathbb{I}$. \r\n\r\nTherefore, to answer that a factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian, we need to check whether the group of allowed states for the non-Abelian group is Abelian or not. A non-Abelian group can have non-Abelian group of allowed states if they are non-Abelian group of unitary operators or if they are based on a non-Abelian representation theory.\r\n\r\nConsidering the following example: \r\n\r\n$U(3)$ is a non-Abelian group. Its factor group consists of the group of unitary matrices $\\mathfrak{C}_k(U(3)), k=1, 2, 3$. The group of allowed states is $(U(3))^* \\times \\mathfrak{C}_k(U(3))$, where $^*$ denotes the complex conjugate. Therefore, the state factor group for $U(3)$ is non-Abelian.\r\n\r\n(B) Lemma: Let $G$ be a group and $\\lambda$-group and let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $H$ such that $N\\cap \\lambda$-group = $Z(H)$ and $N\\cap G$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Then, $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\r\n\r\nProof: Let $\\pi:H\\to G$ be such that $\\pi(h)\\in N$ implies $\\pi(h)=h$ for all $h\\in H$. We show that $\\pi$ is a natural inclusion of $N\\cap \\lambda$-group into $Z(H)$. Since $\\lambda$-group is closed under conjugation, we have $\\pi(h)\\in N\\cap \\lambda$-group$ for all $h\\in H$ if and only if $\\pi^\\#h\\in N\\cap \\lambda$-group$ for all conjugates $h\\in H$. But then, $\\pi^\\#h=\\pi(h)$ for all $h\\in H$. Therefore, $\\pi$ is a natural inclusion into $Z(H)$. \r\n\r\nNext, we show that $N\\cap G$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Let $g\\in N\\cap G$. Then, $\\pi(g)\\in N\\cap \\lambda$-group$ for all $g\\in N\\cap G$. But then, $\\pi^*(\\pi(g))=g\\in N\\cap \\lambda$-group$ for all $g\\in N\\cap G$. Therefore, $N\\cap G$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. \r\n\r\nUsing the above lemma, we have $N\\cap \\lambda$-group = $Z(H)$. Therefore, we can assume that $N\\cap \\lambda$-group = $Z(H)$. \r\n\r\nTherefore, since $N$ is a normal subgroup of $H$, it is a normal subgroup of $G$. \r\n\r\n(C) False, False \r\n\r\nLet $K$ be a normal subgroup of $H$ and $H$ a normal subgroup of $G$. Then, by definition of normality, $K$ is also a normal subgroup of $G$. \r\n\r\nFirst, consider $K$ a subgroup of $H$. Let $\\pi:H\\to G$ be a natural inclusion of $K$ into $H$ and $\\lambda$-group such that $\\pi(h)\\in K$ implies $\\pi(h)=h$ for all $h\\in H$. \r\n\r\nLet $\\gamma\\in Z(H)$. Then, by the lemma, we have $\\pi(\\gamma)\\in K$ for all $\\gamma\\in Z(H)$, which means that $\\pi^*(\\pi(\\gamma))=\\gamma\\in K$ for all $0\\neq\\gamma\\in Z(H)$, which means $\\gamma\\in Z(K)$. \r\n\r\nTherefore, $\\pi$ is a natural inclusion of $\\gamma^+H\\cap \\lambda$-group into $H\\cap K$ for all $0\\neq\\gamma\\in Z(H)$, which means that $\\pi$ is a natural inclusion of the conjugates of $\\gamma^+$. Therefore, $\\pi$ is an isomorphism of Abelian groups. \r\n\r\nThis means, that for any $\\gamma\\in Z(H)$, we have $\\gamma^+H\\cap \\lambda$-group is a subgroup of $H\\cap K$, and therefore, it is normal in $H$ (since $H$ as a group is Abelian). \r\n\r\nNow, consider $K$ a subgroup of $H$. Let $\\pi:H\\to G$ be a natural inclusion of $K$ into $H$ such that $\\pi(h)\\in K$ implies $\\pi(h)=h$ for all $h\\in H$. \r\n\r\nLet $\\gamma\\in K$. Then, $\\pi(\\gamma)\\in K$ for all $\\gamma\\in K$, which means that $\\pi^*(\\pi(\\gamma))=\\gamma\\in K$ for all $\\gamma\\in K$, which means $\\gamma\\in Z(K)$. \r\n\r\nTherefore, $\\pi$ is a natural inclusion of $\\gamma^+H$ into $\\gamma^+H\\cap \\lambda$-group for all $\\gamma\\in K$, which means that $\\pi$ is a natural inclusion of the conjugates of $\\gamma^+$. Therefore, $\\pi$ is not an isomorphism of Abelian groups. \r\n\r\nTherefore $N$ is not a normal subgroup of $G$. \r\n\r\n(D) False, True\r\n\r\nLet $G$ be a non-Abelian group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. If $K$ is a normal subgroup of $H$ and $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then $K$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. However, we have that $H$ is not necessarily a normal subgroup of $G$ because it might not be Abelian. In general, a normal subgroup of $H$ is not necessarily a normal subgroup of $G$.

In other words, for any two polynomials f(x) and g(x), we need some x to be able to write both of them as f(x) and g(x) = h(x), where h(x) is some polynomial in the ring. We can choose any variable x to represent our common variable, say, x_3.\r\n\r\nAssuming that f(x_3) = 4, g(x_3) = 2, then we have:\r\n\r\nf(x_3) = 4\r\ng(x_3) = 2x_3 + 6\r\n\r\nNow we can evaluate the product of these two polynomials as:\r\n\r\nf(x_3)g(x_3) = 8(2(x_3 + 3) + 6) = (4 + 12)x_3^2 + 4x_3 + 8\r\n\r\nNow we need to factor this polynomial into irreducible factors in the polynomial ring. We can do this by looking for the GCD of the coefficients of all the monomials that appear in the product. These monomials will have exponents that add up to the degree of the polynomial. Since the product is the product of two polynomials, we know that the degree of each polynomial will be the same.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the degree of f(x_3) is 1, and the degree of g(x_3) is 2. Therefore, the GCD of their coefficients is \u00b11. Since the coefficient of x_3^2 is 1, we only need to consider the coefficients of x_3 and x_3^1. \r\n\r\nIf x_3 = a, then a^2 + 1 = 0 (mod 8), which means that a is not an element of Z_8. In this case, we can not express f(x_3) and g(x_3) as a product of two polynomials in Z_8[x]. Therefore, we can not find the product of f(x) and g(x) in Z_8[x].\r\n\r\nIf x_3 = i, where i is an element of Z_8, then we need to consider the coefficients of x_3 and x_3^1. Here is the factorization of g(x_3):\r\n\r\n2(i + 3)^1 = 2i + 6\r\n\r\nTherefore, the GCD of the coefficients of [2i + 6] and [0] is [2]. Therefore, we can express f(x) = 4x - 5 as:\r\n\r\nf(i) = 4i - 5(i + 3) = 4i - 2\r\n\r\nNow we can express g(x_3) as:\r\n\r\ng(i) = 2i^2 - 4i + 2 = 2i + 2\r\n= g(x_3) / x_3\r\n\r\nTherefore, we can express f(x) and g(x) as:\r\n\r\nf(x) = (4i - 2)x\r\ng(x) = 2ix + 2 / xi\r\n\r\nNow we need to evaluate the product of these two polynomials using Horner's method. First, let us construct the polynomial arithmetic table for f(x) and g(x):\r\n\r\n| x   | f(i) | g(i) |\r\n|-----|------|------|\r\n| x^2 | 8i   | 2i^2 |\r\n| x^1 | -12i | 4i + 2|\r\n| x^0 | 8i + 4| 2i + 2|\r\n\r\nUsing Horner's method, we can evaluate the product f(x)g(x) = 8i^2 - 12i - 8 + 2i^2 -4i + 6i + 4i + 2 = 8i^2 - 4i -6i = (4 + i)(4 - i) in Z8.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the product of f(x) and g(x) in Z_8[x] is:\r\n\r\n(4 + i)(4 - i) = 36 + i^2 - 4i\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n(A) 2x^2 + 5\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n(4 + i)(4 - i) = 36 + i^2 - 4i\r\nThis is the product of f(x) and g(x), but we do not know what f(x) and g(x) are. However, we only need to find a polynomial in Z_8[x] that is equivalent to (4 + i)(4 - i). This polynomial must have an f(x) and a g(x) with degrees less than or equal to 1 and 2, respectively. \r\n\r\nSince the degree of (4 + i) is 1, the polynomial must be of the form 4x - 5. Therefore, the product we have found is equivalent to 36 - 4i. This is equivalent to f(x) = 4x - 5, and we can substitute this into the product:\r\n\r\n36 - 4i = 4(4i - 2) - 5(4i - 2)\r\n= 4i - 2\r\n= 4x - 5\r\n\r\nTherefore, the product of f(x) and g(x) in Z_8[x] is 2x^2 + 5.",
