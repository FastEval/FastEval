From this it can be inferred that\n\n(A) inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus.\n(B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n(C) aggregate supply decreased.\n(D) aggregate demand is steeply sloped.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To infer that inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus, we need to know how much inflation had already occurred in the economy before the fiscal stimulus. This is reason (A). \n\nTo infer that the economy initially had some unemployed resources, this means that the initial conditions of the economy had a large supply of unemployment. This is reason (B).\n\nTo infer that aggregate supply decreased, we need to know how much of the supply was caused by inflation. This is reason (A) and reason (C). Aggregate supply decreased because of inflation means that the total supply of goods and services decreased and there was a trade off between goods and services.\n\nTo infer that aggregate demand is steeply sloped, we need to know the degree to which the demand is controlled by the aggregate supply. This means that the degree to which the economy can use its resources to meet its demand depends on the total consumption of goods and services. If the aggregate demand is steeply sloped, this means that the income and wealth of the wealthy increases faster than the income and wealth of the poor. These factors exert a countervailing effect on their competition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) which translates to \"The aggregate supply decreased, which caused a trade-off between goods and services. The aggregate demand is steeply sloped, which means the economy can use its resources to meet its demand and countervail effects on their competition.\"",

            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nWe can divide these four options into two categories based on the source of production: imported or domestic. \r\n\r\nOption I (imported): The GDP ofimported producers is usually defined as the revenue generated from the sale of products imported to the country. However, in this case, the movie production is being made in Africa by citizens of the U.S., which means it is considered imported. Hence, this option cannot be included in U.S. GDP.\r\n\r\nOption III (domestic): The GDP of domestic producers is measured by the total sales of their products or services. In this case, Olive oil is being sold in Italy, which means it is a domestic producer. Furthermore, the wine is being made in the US by canadian citizens, which means it is also a domestic producer. However, since the wine is produced in the US and then sold in Canada, it is not part of the domestic GDP of the US. Hence, option III cannot be included.\r\n\r\nOption IV (domestic): Blue jeans are a imported product being sold in Japan, which means it is a imported producer.

            "question": "A likely cause of falling Treasury bond prices might be\n\n(A) expansionary monetary policy.\n(B) contractionary monetary policy.\n(C) a depreciating dollar.\n(D) fiscal policy designed to reduce the budget deficit.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to understand the term \"falling Treasury bond prices\" better. This means that bond prices are decreasing and falling, but in the context of Treasury bond prices, the official dollar and USD face value has been constant. Therefore, it is difficult to determine what caused the falling bond prices. Let's look at each of the four causes for falling Treasury bond prices.\r\n\r\n1. Expansionary monetary policy: This is the most common explanation for falling Treasury bond prices, especially in Eurozone countries like Germany and the USA. Expansionary monetary policy involves increasing the money supply (i.e., the quantity of money in circulation) to meet the needs of the economy, and this can lead to a drop in the value of money relative to what it is today. In such a scenario, bond prices would fall, as consumers would be willing to buy more Treasury bonds (or gold) at lower prices to offset the increase in the value of money.\r\n\r\n2. Contractionary monetary policy: This refers to a reduction in the money supply (e.g., a drop in the quantity of money) triggered by fiscal stimulus policies that hurt the economy. In such a scenario, Treasury bond prices would fall because they represent a large part of the overall money supply and their value would be lower than in a scenario where the money supply remains constant.\r\n\r\n3. A depreciating dollar: This refers to the imminent failure of a government-issued currency, such as the euro, which is due to a slowing economy or political instability. In such a scenario, Treasury bond prices would fall because they would be based on a depreciated dollar, which would also reduce the underlying value of the bond.\r\n\r\n4. Fiscal policy designed to reduce the budget deficit: This is a scenario where the government has attempted to balance both a surplus and a deficit by cutting spending or investing in new programs. This can lead to a drop in the overall economic output and inflationary pressures that can cause bond prices to fall.\r\n\r\nBased on this information, the likely cause for falling Treasury bond prices is (B) contractionary monetary policy. However, it is not clear whether the contraction is gradual or sudden. Therefore, it is advisable to wait for the trend to stabilize before making a decision, as another cause could also be at work. Using the capital markets as a benchmark, the fall in bond prices could indicate that the central banks are taking steps to reduce their own holdings in Treasury bills, indicating contractionary monetary policy.",

            "question": "Households demand more money as an asset when\n\n(A) nominal GDP falls.\n(B) the nominal interest rate falls.\n(C) bond prices fall.\n(D) the supply of money falls.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nAs households demand more money as an asset, it means that they have more financial security in the long-term. Therefore, the demand for more money in the short-term and the willingness to bear the costs of goods and services increases.\r\n\r\nIf the nominal GDP falls, then that could mean that the economy is in trouble since it's not economical to have a livelihood in the future. It could also mean that the stronger economy is experiencing recessions, which could lead to financial distress for households.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the nominal interest rate is falling, then this could be a good sign for households to invest in their financial assets since interest rates are usually low if the economy is doing well. The interest rate could also be rising, which is also a possibility but likely to be temporary since interest rates usually tend to fall after economic stability has been restored.\r\n\r\nIf bond prices are falling, then this could be a good sign for banks to increase their loan size to investors, which could help to finance future expenses. This could also be a bad sign, but it could encourage investors to take lower interest rates that may lead to higher bond prices.\r\n\r\nIf the supply of money is falling, then this could be a bad sign for banks to be in debt, which could lead to financial hardship for consumers and could potentially put them out of business. However, if the banks manage to keep up with their debt obligations, then they may be able to continue lending money for a while.\r\n\r\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is C (Bond prices fall).",

            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nProduction within a nation's borders: A GDP measure that is only relevant to economies that export a significant amount of their products. For economies that do not export much, this measure may not be very useful and may not be accurate. However, it is commonly used as an external benchmark for comparison with the GDP measure that focuses on citizens' economic activity.\r\n\r\nProduction by a nation's citizens wherever they may be: This measure covers the entire economy and is more accurate than the previous one. It is indeed closely related to the GDP of a nation.\r\n\r\nIncome earned by the factors of production plus depreciation and indirect business taxes: This measure is useful for understanding the financial performance of a nation and is closely related to other economic indicators such as interest rates, inflation, and unemployment.\r\n\r\n(A) and (C) are both incorrect. (A) is production within a nation's borders, which is a measure that is not relevant to economies where citizens are not also producers.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\nA: Unidimensionality of income-production cycle \u2013 the cyclical unemployment of a nation cannot be established without a clear understanding of the income-production cycle and the fundamental assumptions behind the model such as the existential friction between workers and capital. Therefore, it is impossible to have cyclical unemployment.\r\n\r\nB: Central bank re-adjustment to policy intervention \u2013 if there is no natural rate of unemployment, central banks can no longer implement policies that aim to increase the absolute level of unemployment. Therefore, inflation should not be zero either.\r\n\r\nC: Structural problem - Since there is no unemployment, there must be a structural issue at play. Structural issues are often related to political, economic, and institutional institutions and they inhibit the ability of workers to produce economic output. Therefore, structural unemployment is unlikely.\r\n\r\nD: Unemployment is a sustained condition, not a one-time event, and it can continue to persist until a new worker arrives or labour forces are replaced by new jobs. Therefore, the recession that a nation is experiencing is different from natural unemployment and is associated with cyclical unemployment rather than cyclical economic growth.
