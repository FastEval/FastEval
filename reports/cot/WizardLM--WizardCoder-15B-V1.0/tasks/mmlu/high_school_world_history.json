            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nThe question asks about the developments that are most associated with the passage. Here is the reasoning:\r\n\r\n1. With the formation of the non-aligned movement, Indonesia faced an extraordinary challenge to maintain peace. Non-aligned groups had been fighting for political power and recently experienced widespread protests against the head of state Sriwijaya (the leader of an anti-Kaharah government who finally tried to dissolve the Kenya-Indonesia government peace treaty). The movement (also called the non-governmental organizations) helped spark a counter-revolutionary movement in Indonesia that helped create a basis for a political future.\r\n\r\n2. In non-aligned groups, each group had different attitudes and ideologies, which in turn, affected the political and economic course of Indonesia. The non-aligned movement, by organizing people from different walks of life, achieved political power in some areas of the country that it wouldn't have achieved through electoral politics alone. However, it also brought about a conflict between the groups in power and led to mob rule and the dissolution of the Kenya-Indonesia government peace treaty.\r\n\r\n3. The Green Revolution in agriculture in Indonesia, performed by greenpeace activists, brought about a significant change in global agricultural practices. The green revolution was a response to the industrialization and urbanization of the country that was creating harmful and environmentally damaging effects on the environment. The revolution was a way to create a new economy based on environmentally sound practices and policies that were recognized by governments and societies around the world.\r\n\r\n4. The mobilization of pan-Asian ideology in peacekeeping efforts by peace activists, state leaders and citizens, helped in building the ASEAN-type power in Asia and Africa. The ASEAN nations had the participation of over 20 states in South-East Asia. The unification of these nations helped increase their internal stability and economic security and opened up new markets for global trade.\r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\nBased on the reasoning, the passage most probably has an association with the Green Revolution in agriculture in Indonesia. The question assumes that the passage is similar to the one in the question, which could also be true. Therefore, the correct answer would be B - The Green Revolution in agriculture in Indonesia.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to identify the topic of global history. Identifying the topic of global history requires further examining the passage where the question is posed.\n\nFirst, we notice that the question is about gunpowder weapons. From the context, we understand that gunpowder weapons were a key technology during the early days of European strategic warfare. Gunpowder weapons were largely dependable and easy to manufacture, but they had limited utility and could only be wielded by trained soldiers. This is in contrast to the Chinese or Japanese style of weaponry, which were much more mobile and capable, but required specialized techniques and extensive training. Therefore, we immediately focus on gunpowder weaponry as the topic of the question.\n\nNext, we notice that the choice of ethnic group has a significant impact on the development of gunpowder weapons and related technologies. In Western Europe during the 1200s and 1400s, due to the elevation of cannon balls, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\n\nThis leads us to the first large-scale question (\"A\") which asks how societies shared strategically important technologies with each other. This is important because the development of gunpowder weapons was a strategic technology that was shared with multiple societies, primarily Europeans and their allies, including the Chinese and Japanese. The Chinese and Japanese also adopted similar techniques, behaviors, and weapons, which had significant strategic advantages for them, particularly in siege-tactics.\n\nFinally, we infer that the choice of ethnic group has significant impact on the development of gunpowder weapons and related technologies because it affects the power balance between Western and non-Western powers. In the end, the choice of ethnic group does not determine the outcome of the question, but it can make a significant impact on the development of gunpowder weapons and related technologies.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nThe city of Ghana consists of two towns. One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .\n\u2014The Book of Routes and Realms , by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri, eleventh-century Muslim historian and geographer\nWhat evidence is there in the passage that Ghanians were engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia?\n\n(A) They kept horses in their court, which would have come from the Mongols.\n(B) The Ghanian king had adopted the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow .\n(C) The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.\n(D) The people in his court wore silk robes.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:The article quotes the folklore of a Ghanian king named Abu al-Hashmi in The Book of Routes and Realms, which is a handbook of Muslim folk heroes. The kingdom of Ghana is mentioned throughout the book and is also related to the legend of the Hovering Mountains.\r\n\r\nFirst, let's consider the answer \"(A) They kept horses in their court, which would have come from the Mongols.\" The passage says that Ghanaians had horse heritage from one of the earliest known parts of the world, the Mongols. This information suggests that they were engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with another Ghanian kingdom, potentially the Mongols. \r\n\r\nNext, we can consider the answer \"(B) The Ghanian king had adopted the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow.\" This statement is not clear enough to make a decisive conclusion. What does the term \"kow-tow\" refer to? From the context, it is not clear if it was used in reference to a cultural practice that might have arose in the ancient Chinese Empire or if it was a reference to a specific object that was manufactured by one of the Ghanian kings. Additionally, the Chinese kings typically wore bronze apparel and a cloak, while Ghanaians preferred cloth. It is unclear whether this statement is referring to a specific practice or style, or if it is being used as a trope or hypothetical.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, we will consider the answer \"(C) The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.\" This statement is also not very clear in terms of how it fits into the story. The article quotes a passage from a book called The Golden King and describes a Ghanian king who had won over many by wearing gold and jewels. It is not clear where or when this legend originated or what the specific object referred to. The only guess that can be made is that it could have been a bull's-eye-shaped golden medal that was usually worn on the king's neck.\r\n\r\nFinally, we can consider the answer \"(D) The people in his court wore silk robes.\" This statement is also not very clear in terms of what it refers to. The passage does not specify what the \"court\" was, and it is not clear if it refers to the town or the people who live there. It is also not clear if the robes were made from fresh silk or were made from cloth or leather. It is also not clear whether they were wearing cotton, silk, or brocade, or a mix of styles. Finally, it is unclear what constitutes \"a mix of styles\", or if this is referring to a repetitive style or a wide variety of styles.\r\n\r\nFrom the responses provided, it is not clear which answer is correct or why there is disagreement about the correct answer. It is also not clear whether the passage is being used as an example of Ghanians engaged in trade with Asia or whether it is being used as a justification for Ghanians to adopt Chinese practices.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "A) The Arab-Israeli conflict is one of the most important global conflicts we face today. Despite the territorial dispute over Iraq and the provision of humanitarian aid to the Palestinians, the Arab states have long been at war with Israel, which has continued to be a heavily armed ally throughout the Arab world. The fallout of the Arab War has leveled the playing field for both countries for generations to come. Given the crushing forces and resentment towards Israel in the Arab world, Sukarno's position as de facto leader in the broader Islamic world forces does not adequately confront the Arab and Islamic allies of his other countries. The plea for peace from the peoples of Africa does not fully convince the enemies of these countries to back down from their violent, imperialist, and self-sustaining actions.\r\n\r\nB) The tensions and conflicts between the US and North Korea have been the main focus of concerns for many years. In 2004, Kim Jong-un attempted to invade North Korea through a missile program. The US and United Nations insurgents conducted simultaneous counterattacks, with more than 100,000 hostilities reported throughout the North Korean-reigning Kim regime. The tide of events has shifted the focus of attention towards the two countries' relationship and peace process. Despite the humanitarian help provided by both sides and the hope for a cooperative effort, it remains a sensitive and complex issue only indirectly related to the security of their national interests.\r\n\r\nC) The Cold War is a frequently-mentioned topic in many international political circles. Public opinion in the United States and the United Kingdom has been divisive over the theory of war and peace, with some thinking that Italian tutto-frutto schools of thought are correct, while others are arguing that American interests should align with Western principles. Despite the ethical and military conflicts potentially threatening the United States and its allies, Sukarno's leadership and political connections in the Middle East have not been able to border on ideological extremism, as some believe.\r\n\r\nD) The Vietnam war has been a controversial issue for several years now, and Sukarno's political stances and actions have generally been among the most open-minded and generous of his predecessors. Yet despite the numerous civilians who have died, injured, and disappeared during the war, Sukarno remains committed to achieving the peace process and preventing another widespread conflict. According to him, the recent demonstrations, coup d'etat, and protests in the United States, South Vietnam, and Cambodia are the result of political pressure from neighboring countries and are not just the product of Western interference. Rather, they show the foundation for a successful and long-lasting peace process.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, Sukarno, an excellent, broad-minded leader in several of the most significant global issues, attempted to fix the Arab-Israeli conflict in B. However, his position leaves the peaceful homelands of Africa and Asia to the more aggressive or extreme such as the Korean War and the Cold War, and the crucial Vietnam conflict. To overcome these challenges, Muslim countries of Africa and Asia must mobilize the spiritual, moral, and political strength they have to overcome their current opposition and unite to create a new world order.",

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized.
