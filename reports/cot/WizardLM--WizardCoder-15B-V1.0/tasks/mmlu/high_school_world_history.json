            "model_answer": "The passage speaks about the struggle to overthrow the core opposition group, the Javanese resistance movement, and the perceived machinations of his nationalist leadership in the 1940s. Over the next decade, the Indonesian people through the formation of the non-aligned movement transformed the militant movement into a political movement. During this process, the mild-mannered Javanese resistance remained mostly intact, but was directed by the supporters of Banglian nationalist leader Siruh Kholifah to Washington, D.C., where it ultimately fell to the wayside. The non-aligned movement transformed the fight for independence into a struggle to honor and defend the Khmer and Banglian identity.\n\nOn the spectrum of issues addressed by the non-aligned movement, the Non-Aligned Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia, led by Professor <NAME>, engaged in the Green Revolution in agriculture, which was a radical change in Indonesia's agricultural policy towards more sustainable practices. The committee massively produced increases in the area under cultivation, as well as new techniques in planting and harvesting, most notably the use of herbicides and pesticides. The committee was also heavily involved in the development of modern forestry techniques, including the use of high-energy ultraviolet rays to cut down trees. Overall, the committee played a pivotal role in accelerating Indonesia's agribusiness development in the 1950s, which would eventually have implications for the entire region, including economic development and social stability.\n\nBy independence from the British empire in 1945, Indonesia experienced a transition period in which the majority population were Javanese, but there has been a revival of the mundane aspects of life, including the arts, trade, and social interaction. In 1950, the formation of the non-aligned movement spearheaded a fundamental shift in the political mindset of Indonesia, away from a military focus to a political one that promoted peaceful coexistence. Nonetheless, the Indonesian political system is still more militaristic and autocratic than its Western peers.\n\nOverall, the answer to the question is D, Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology.",

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

Therefore, maintaining peace and stability will not only reduce tensions, but also increase security and stability at home and abroad.\r\n- With peace the independence of the Indonesian people is less important than the endless challenges that they will face in the future. They must continue to build on their values of peace and justice, which will continue to be cherished throughout their country. As the Republic of Indonesia is committed to building a better future for all, maintaining peace and stability is no small feat.\r\n- The conflict between the Arab-Israeli and Arab states in the Middle East has been one of the most important conflicts in modern history. Sukarno attempted to develop a peace treaty with the Israeli government, but instead had to resort to clashes and peacemaking operations in their territories. \r\n- The Korean War is a far-reaching global crisis that has affected every aspect of the world. Despite its challenges, Sukarno realized that any attempt to continue isolationism and isolation would only delay the consequences of the Korean War. Therefore, it is important that the world prepares for the worst in the near future, including ethnic cleansing and support for the continued operation of large-scale military operations.\r\n- The Cold War is a complex and strategic conflict. Despite its challenges, Sukarno drew a clear line between peaceful operations and those that seek to expand terror and dominance. It is important to continue large-scale military operations even if they undermine traditional institutions and may encroach on the sovereignty of the West.\r\n- The Vietnam War is a classic conflict in which two major powers have clashed in Vietnam, the North Vietnamese government and the South Vietnamese government. Despite its challenges, Sukarno realized that the South Vietnamese government is not empowered to resolve the conflict and therefore tried to articulate a peace treaty favorable to the Vietnamese people. \r\n\r\nAnswer:The answer is (C) the Cold War.

On some secret mission, some time in the future, the so-called \"Puritan\" press led to the question of what was the best thing that could be said about Revolutionary times. Bliss was an optimistic and encouraging statement about the French Revolution, telling the ideas which the Revolution had taught us, but with a conviction that it was not accidental and that it had had to be lived out.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding means being a man of high moral principles and feeling that his viewpoint should be justified by evidence, and thus he is willing to accept the Revolution as it stands.

Understanding may also come through a healthy sense of understanding and accepting of the difficulties that face those at the margins of power, and the struggle to move forward.\r\n\r\nCynical means he sits up and looks down at the world with pity, trying to visibly see something that is miserable or glaringly wrong about it.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nFirstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent.\r\n\r\nImperialism is central to Western Europe and its colonies. In the ancient world, imperialism was the dominant political and economic system and it dominated not only Africa but also much of the rest of the world. Capitalists from Western Europe extracted a fortune from the colonies, and the profit they made helped fund the empire.\r\n\r\nThe African continent experienced severe economic and social changes during this period, and the imperialism of the time put a significant strain on the economy and the political system. The Imperialist Agreement of 1688 allowed colonial powers to expand their territories and oversteer their colonial interests. The new empires were called colonies because they were smaller than the empires of Western Europe and had their own colonial elites.\r\n\r\nDuring the African War of Independence, Western Europeans and colonists wanted to revive their colonial empires in Africa. With the power of the colonies, they started colonizing Africa and building up powerful colonial governments. Imperialism quickly became the dominant political and economic system in Africa and emerged as the main obstacle to economic development in Africa.\r\n\r\nSecondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system.\r\n\r\nWestern Europeans considered themselves agents of the imperialist system by creating the Pan-Nationalist Revolution. They did so by arguing that they were playing a key role in maintaining the dominance of Western Europe during this time. They also argued that Western Europeans were responsible for the declining African economy, but the true culprit was the colonists, who were exploiting the colonial market and enforced policies of espionage and exploitation that stole wealth.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, African sub-continental rulers of the time were often viewed as the sole beneficiaries of the colonial empire, because they were already dependent on their colonies. The sub-continental rulers used their wealth and resources to finance colonial policies and control commerce, leading to an economic decline that pushed the population into need of better living conditions and sources of economic opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa. They spread commerce and cultural influences across the continent because they believed that economic development is a global problem.\r\n\r\nThe question of what was responsible for the declining African economy suggested that the operation of the imperialist system bears responsibility for the decline. The colonists also played a role in manipulating the economy, but the true culprit was the capitalists who were driving the population out of Africa and causing damage to the imperialist system.\r\n\r\nWhen Africa started to recover from the economic decline during the second half of the 19th century, it needed a new economic and political system. The sub-continental rulers and the trading contacts with Europeans were essential for this development. In the end, it was the sub-continental rulers who forced the colonial powers to create their colonial government and refocus African development efforts on creating jobs and restoring economic prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe best explanation is that the Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nThis is a false assumption, as the colonies did not rely on the merchants of the sixth world for this purpose. Instead, they traded with Europeans for other goods such as slaves, gold, and other resources that were essential for raising their population. This approach did not help the African continent's economy and caused a widespread migration.\r\n\r\nInstead, the only reason Sub-Saharan Africans had enough slaves to feed the world was because of trade agreements with Europeans. They used their vast wealth to fine-tune their trade and eventually expanded their lands and cultures. The African empire grew rapidly and rebuilt its infrastructure. The colonists did not need to import goods or services from Europe because the colonies had their own population and a strong industry that directly generated revenue.\r\n\r\nThe best response is \"(B) Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.\"\r\n\r\nSub-Saharan Africans were often very well-skilled in arts and crafts and had access to modern communication tools. They also had a deep cultural background, and they used their markets as a platform for building regional economies. They traded with Europeans for goods such as firearms, porcelain, and oil, which were very important for their survival. However, trade with Europeans for consumables such as soldiers or firearms did not significantly influence the population growth of the continent.\r\n\r\nThat is why the African sub-continent did not experience a crisis like it did in the late 1800s or early 1900s. Instead, the sub-continent turned its attention to other areas such as education, healthcare, and transportation. The sub-continent collapsed into decline as the number of slaves increased, due to the lack of skilled labor and access to modern communication tools.\r\n\r\nThe best response is \"(D) Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty.\"\r\n\r\nThe true explanation is that Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers in the 19th century to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty. The African continent had colonies established on the Mediterranean Coast, and the trading relationships with the Mediterranean nations influenced the African mindset about the importance of trade and presented a platform for building regional economies. Once Africa started to recover from the economic decline, Muslim and Arab merchant princes were a threat to the newly established sub-continent.\r\n\r\nThe sub-continent slowly began to collapse as a result of the declining population and an increasing tension between Muslim and Arab rulers. Eventually, the Afghanistan War put an end to the alliance, and the African continent was fractured into two economic entities with conflicting goals and policies. In 1947, African governments attempted to resolve the conflict by demanding that Muslim leader Eli Banat stab Muslim forces, but they were defeated in Baghdad.\r\n\r\nThe sub-continent suffered another economic crisis during World War II, and the major part of the population was taken by the newly formed Algerian state. However, the African continent gained economic independence from the Europeans and continued its militaristic activities, eventually leading to the Algerian invasion of Afghanistan in 1954, which ended in total peace.\r\n\r\nThe best response is \"(C) Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.\"\r\n\r\nSub-Saharan Africans depend on European merchants to purchase slaves. The colonists traded with the Europeans for resources such as gold, oil, or firearms, which they used to finance their colonial policies and the cultivation of their lands. However, the sub-continental rulers also used their wealth and resources to purchase officers and soldiers for their armed forces.\r\n\r\nNotably, the use of slaves was a significant factor in the recovery of Africa from its economic reliance on colonial goods and trade. The scarcity of natural resources also resulted in a significant economic crisis for the African continent. Tropical droughts and famines caused economic slump that led to a decade-long freezing of prices and slow population growth.\r\n\r\nBy the mid-20th century, African economy had become a major industry in the world, with an estimated GDP of US$16.5 trillion. However, one factor that contributed to its fragile economic situation was the Muslim separatist movement that led to a mass acquisition of small-scale mineral resources and land by Arab states. This movement caused a tremendous damage to the African economy, leading to a 20-year economic meltdown.\r\n\r\nDuring the 20th century, the African continent experienced massive depression that caused widespread fam",

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized.
