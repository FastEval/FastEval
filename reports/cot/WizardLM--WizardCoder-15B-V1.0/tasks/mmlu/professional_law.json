            "question": "One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\n(B) admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\n(C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n(D) inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",

            "model_answer": "The reasons behind the inadmissibility of option C are as follows:\n\n1. The attorney-client privilege does not cover the communications between the attorney and client in person while the attorney was not present. It covers communications via email, phone and other electronic mediums when the attorney is in attendance.\n\n2. A person may be admissible without being held liable for at least some of the alleged breach of confidentiality, if the attorney-client privilege is waived by the filing of the lawsuit. This may occur when the attorney provides to the client a statement of the alleged offense made under oath to the knowledge of his attorney.\n\n3. The broader issue here is that the attorney-client privilege assumes the risk of any misunderstanding between the attorney and the client about the client's rights under the law. Here, there is no misunderstanding, so the privilege cannot be waived.\n\n4. Moreover, the alleged violation of the attorney-client privilege occurred after the consultation with the father, not before. Therefore, the privilege cannot be waived or rescinded.",

One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found\n\n(A) not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(B) not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(C) guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n(D) guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.",

            "question": "A taxpayer was notified by the government that her individual income tax was underpaid by $1,012. 69. The taxpayer retained an attorney to represent her in contesting the assessment. During the preparation of his client's case, the attorney suggested that it might be a good idea if the taxpayer hired an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement for the year in question. Following the attorney's advice, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, who prepared a financial statement, which the attorney referred to at trial. During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testif' about statements that the taxpayer made to him. The accountant's proposed testimony is\n\n(A) inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n(B) inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.\n(C) inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.\n(D) admissible as an admission.",

            "model_answer": "The attorney-client privilege pertains to the privilege of the attorney to have a lawyer present at a trial with the client in order to assist the client in presenting evidence in court. This privilege is meant to protect the right of the client to be represented without undue personal risk to themselves. Therefore, the accountant's proposed testimony violates this privilege because it suggests that the taxpayer violated their right to have an attorney present at the trial.\n\nAssuming that the accountant's proposed statement is admissible, we can now proceed to analyze whether it violates the taxpayer's self-incrimination privilege or not. The taxpayer's self-incrimination privilege pertains to the right of the taxpayer to be free from incriminating evidence that could cause legal action against them. In the proposed case, the accountant may have testified that they prepared the financial statement while working for the taxpayer, which could cause them to be liable for work-product infringement under the Federal Labor Standards Act. However, the attorney has also suggested that the accountant is more qualified to prepare the statement than a taxpayer. Therefore, the proposed statement should not be admissible under the taxpayer's self-incrimination privilege.\n\nTherefore, the accountant's testimony that the attorney prepared the financial statement to the taxpayer would not constitute an infringement of the attorney-client privilege. Additionally, the accountant's testimony that the attorney has no qualifications to prepare a financial statement would not be admissible under the taxpayer's self-incrimination privilege; it could only be admissible under the attorney-client privilege.\n\nTherefore, the proposed answer is \"D - Admissible as an admission,\" as it is admissible as per the accountant's proposed testimony under both the attorney-client privilege and the taxpayer's self-incrimination privilege.",

            "question": "A defendant was angry at his friend for marrying the defendant's former girlfriend. As the friend was painting his house one afternoon, the defendant fired a shot from his gun at him. Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter. The defendant is subsequently charged with the first-degree murder of the daughter. The relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are as follows:Section 169: Murder in the first degree is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170: Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. Which of the following, if established, would provide the defendant with his best defense?\n\n(A) He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.\n(B) He intended only to wound the friend.\n(C) He was unaware of the elements of malice.\n(D) The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nAs a defendant is charged with the first degree murder of a person, one possible explanation is that the defendant intended to kill the person he is accused of with intent. In the case of the friend, he did not have a bullets-per-shot limit, and he could have killed the whole person.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the defendant's best defense is (A) he intended to kill the friend and not the daughter. This means that the defendant did not have the intention to kill only the person he is accused of, but rather the entire person including all of his belongings and property.\r\n\r\nThe relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are Section 169, Murder in the first degree, and Section 170, Malice. Section 169 states that the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with intent to take away the life of another is the definition of murder in the first degree. This means that the defendant is guilty of a class A felony.\r\n\r\nSection 170 contains a definition of malice: \"Deliberate and intensely shameful intention to commit serious and reckless acts, ordinarily foolish or insulting.\" In this case, the defendant was not purposefully inflicting harm, so he is not guilty of malice.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the defendant is guided by the law to believe that (A) he intended to kill the friend and not the daughter, which is the absolute best defense he has. He is therefore entitled to a jury verdict of not guilty.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nNext, we need to consider possible reasons why the statement made by the accused is admissible and why it is inadmissible.\r\n\r\nIf the accused is trying to confess something involuntary, it is possible that the statement was accidentally omitted or implied. Involuntary confessions are admissible under some circumstances, such as when the express purpose of the confession is to establish a criminal intention or to obtain evidence on a certain charge. \r\n\r\nIf the accused is trying to confess something voluntary, that is, by making a statement that he actually believes or feels, he has a legal right to make his confession. A legal case for making a voluntary confession can also be based on a revelation or testimony that is unrelated to the accused's request for the confession. \r\n\r\nIt is also possible that the defendant was not in custody when the statement was made, although the police staff may have previously interrogated the criminal, and their conduct may reveal information about an intended accusation. \r\n\r\nFinally, it is also possible that the statement was not made in response to a known police interrogation. If the accused accepts the evidence presented before him, it may be inadmissible to refute or dispute the evidence, or to make a new confession unrelated to the original intention.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the confession made by the accused is inadmissible in the following situations: \r\n\r\n1. The defendant's statement was involuntary.\r\n2. The defendant was not in custody when the statement was made.\r\n3. The statement was not made in response to a known police interrogation.\r\n\r\nAnswer: The confession made by the accused is inadmissible in situation B and situation D.",

            "question": "A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order\n\n(A) valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\n(B) valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\n(C) invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\n(D) invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.",

The President issued an executive order to travel to the country and rescue the victims, but on deciding to concede, he also condemned the decision of the member of the federal agency who refused to comply. The court had the power to determine the validity of the decision and based on the fact that the President's order is unconstitutional in various ways, it correctly concluded that the decision was invalid. Therefore, although it is technically feasible for the President to issue an order like this, it is not the best way to confront the illicit alien population of the stricken country. The only way to save the lives of those affected by this disaster would be to gather support from the American people and take to the streets, rather than relying on the military.",

Section 2235(b)(2). \r\n- This means that a person who intentionally seeks to do a look-alike crime, without being caught or convicted of the crime, and without the lawyer's consent, is guilty of the offense. \r\n- However, there are certain cases according to the law that are considered to be exempt from warrantless searches, which are:\r\n  - Cold Pursuit: This is when the victim seeks to hide the items they have stolen or to hide the person who stole them from the police or prosecutors. \r\n  - Incident to a lawful arrest: This is when the attacker seeks to use the person who has been arrested for an offense, or to hide the arrest itself, in a sexual or other deceiving manner, and then incite the arrestee to pursue the attacker.\r\n  - Plain view: This is when the victim seeks to cover their face or other body parts and blend into the surroundings.\r\n- Stop and frisk, on the other hand, is not a type of warrantless search exception, meaning that the law treats people who engage in this type of non-legal activity as non-violent offences and can be charged with them.\r\n- Therefore, only Cold Pursuit and Incident to a Lawful Arrest are not wanna-be search exceptions while the other two are.

Along with the mirror itself, the manufacturer provided brackets and bolts to be used for hanging the mirror. The grocery store paid a local carpenter to come in and hang the mirror. A few days after the carpenter installed the mirror, the mirror suddenly fell from the wall because of a defect in the brackets. It struck a shopper on the head, causing serious injuries to him. If the shopper asserts a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort, the plaintiff will\n\n(A) prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.\n(B) prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.\n(C) not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n(D) not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nA) The carpenter installed the mirror using a precise set of brackets, which were tested to ensure that they fit precisely. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the brackets were defective when installed. Therefore, the liability lies with the customer, and the carpenter is not responsible for any harm caused to him by the mirror.\r\n\r\nThis scenario may result in significant harm, such as the shopper claims of being liable for injuries sustained by the mirror. There is no evidence to support this claim, so it is difficult to determine whether the plaintiff would prevail. However, this scenario would likely result in a permanent injury for the shopper, which should prompt him to seek legal counsel immediately.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the shopper did not seek medical attention immediately, he may well be hospitalized, suffering permanent disability and/or death. Here, the carpenter is responsible for all harm caused to the shopper. Although no liability lies with the plaintiff, the carpenter may be liable for a reasonable attorney's fee, as upon suffering injury, the reponsibility is assumed to lie entirely with the injured party (i.e., the shopper).\r\n\r\nB) The defect in the brackets would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of an outlet because of the severity of the injury and the potential for permanent damage. If the shopping cart were to suddenly fall from the wall, damage to the electronics would be very difficult to avoid. In such a case, even the manufacturer would not be able to prevent the mirror from falling. Therefore, the plaintiff would not be afforded an adequate remedy.\r\n\r\nC) Although the carpenter had the right to install the mirror, he was not directly involved in the sale of the grocery store products. It is unlikely that the carpenter was aware of the defect in the brackets until the day before it was installed. The defect in the brackets was not apparent at the time of installation, meaning that it cannot be ruled out as the cause of the fall. Therefore, the carpenter cannot be held liable for any harm caused by his actions.\r\n\r\nD) The plaintiff has no clear liability of the carpenter's conduct for installing the mirror. He cannot be held responsible for the injury caused by the defect in the brackets. Therefore, the carpenter is not entitled to prevail.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer is (C): Not prevail. The carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror, and the defect in the brackets is not relevant to his actions.",

The man and his purported second wife bought a home together as tenants by the entirety. They lived there together for a few years, when the man was accused and convicted of killing his purported wife. He was given a life sentence. The decedent's estate brought a quiet title action to declare the property forfeited to the decedent on the basis that a murderer cannot benefit from his crime. The trial court awarded the property to the estate. The man appealed from his prison cell. Under the common law, will the appellate court affirm the trial court's decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home?\n\n(A) Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\n(B) Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\n(C) No, the court will as a policy matter recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common.\n(D) No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nIf the man had only sold the property to the purported second wife and left the home, they would be free to proceed with the next man.\r\n\r\nSince he was actually the holder of the home, the case would be brought against the decedent, not the purported wife.\r\n\r\nHe had already established a lawless marriage, and the marriage had become a legalized sex act.\r\n\r\nThe trial court's decision to award the property to the estate is in no way overriding the decedent's estate title.\r\n\r\nThe man appealing from prison is not an attempt to assert guilt on the decedent for having murdered his wife.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the only answer that would follow from the reasoning is: B. B - Yes, because mortgage creditors are not allowed to take advantage of grief to exit corrupted estates.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe answer B is based on the simple fact of the law. The laws allow mortgage creditors to be legally liable for damages caused by a deceased or accelerated deterioration of a mortgagee's property, but it is a condition of the motion for title and is only supposed to apply if there are a substantial and continual risk of falling into contractual or other legal hands. The rule states that a creditor who deliberately engages in a bad faith payment run is liable to be fined or have other legal consequences. Therefore, the decedent's estate title may be acquired even if the purported second wife is the first wife who committed the murder. Additionally, a creditor who wants to exit a deceased estate must demonstrate substantial damage caused by the borrower's illegal actions, and the laws provide that a debtor whose property has been wrongfully used, tortured, or stolen cannot be liable to an award of the property at all.",
