            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nWe assume that the answer to this question is B due to the description of the profile and the lack of any explanation. \r\n\r\nThe reason for this is because a dished face profile is commonly associated with a maxilla that is too small to form the expected shape. This may be due to failure of elongation of the cranial base, resulting in a smaller than normal maxilla. Additionally, the recessive nature of this maxilla may result in the appearance of a small, recessively located mandible, rather than a larger bending one.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer is B.",

The kidneys, an organ found in the abdomen, are responsible for collecting, processing, and expelling waste and urine. The kidney is separated into two parts, the renal cortex and the renal medulla. The kidney cortex is responsible for digestion of carbohydrates and fats and the renal medulla is further divided into two parts. One part is called the pelvis and the other part is called the ureter. The ureter is responsible for pushing the collected urine out through the urethra as well as collecting any sodium and water from the body and passing it down to the kidneys for further processing.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) Melanocytes.\r\n\r\nTo derive structures from ectomesenchyme, one must first understand what ectomesenchyme is. Ectomesenchyme is a term that refers to cells containing two or more cytoplasmic organelles. In this case, the cell has both a mitochondrial and nuclear component. The mitochondrion is the organelle that produces ATP, and the nucleus is where the cytoplasm sits.\r\n\r\nMelanocytes are a substance derived from the mitochondria of the ectomesenchyme called melanosomes. They are smaller and hair-like and serve as a protective barrier for cells as they undergo mitosis. This means that they cannot undergo a normal mitosis and must be specialised for cell division. This is why melanocytes are thought to be involved in motor neuron development and disease.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Melanocytes.",

It is responsible for supplying oxygen and nutrients to the kidney, and exerts pressure on the glomerulus to form capillaries. There is only one afferent arteriole per nephron.\r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nIn this cluster of blood capillaries, the afferent arteriole is the simplest and most foundational structure. It connects each nephron to the aorta, exerts pressure on the glomerulus to form capillaries, and supplies oxygen and nutrients to the kidney. The afferent arteriole may be one of the first features to arise in any kidney, but it remains relatively constant throughout the lifetime of the kidney.

The hair in the nose is particularly effective at removing bacteria from the nose because mucous membranes secrete the bacteria into the nose. The mucous membranes also contain enzymes that digest bacteria. Therefore, when bacteria are presented to the nose, they often escape into the mucous membranes and are removed by the hair in the nose.",

However, there are some similarities between the options. Because the palatine processes fuse at a similar time in one of the remaining four options, it is most likely that all four options have different meanings. Since most people who consume palatine juices do not consume them immediately after fertilization, it is likely that women consume their palatine juices at some point during the pregnancy. Therefore, fusing the palatine processes occurs at an earlier time than in the options given.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\n\nMotor cortex is involved in movement that is primarily used for navigation and manipulation of limbs. Its primary purpose is to generate movements in the limbs, including coordination, extension, and flexion of the joints. As part of this process, the motor cortex plays an important role in controlling movement of the limbs. In other words, the motor cortex is responsible for generating voluntary movements in the limbs, including the decision-making process that determines the direction and speed of movement in the limb. \r\n\r\nThe primary motor cortex activity involves movement of the motor cortices and the selection and function of the muscles that are involved in motor action. The activity is performed in response to the movement of the body. This leads to the formation of a complex network of connections and signals between the nucleus accumbens, cholinergic nuclei, and sympathetic olfactory bulb nuclei. \r\n\r\nThe bilateral contraction of antigravity limb muscles is a result of the primary motor cortex activity resulting in the prismatic changes of muscle tension across the limbs. This results in the contraction of the antigravity limb muscles, which result in the extension or flexion of the joints. The contraction of these muscles results in the generation of voluntary movements in the limbs. \r\n\r\nThe answer is (A) bilateral contraction of antigravity limb muscles.",
