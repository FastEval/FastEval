            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "A) Paralysis of facial muscles is an option but it's unclear whether this includes topical applications that target the facial nerve or would also cause compression there. Compression of the facial nerve could be caused by other reasons, such as trauma or inflammation. Another option would be a constriction of the lumen of the facial nerve, which may result in wave-like distortions that are not due to compression.\n\nTherefore, it's best to stay uncertain and assume that the cause of compression is either a disease in the area affecting the nerve or a trauma or inflammation that has locally spread to the nerve. The answer to the question should not be based on the type of compression, but rather whether it causes ipsilateral paralysis or bilateral paralysis and/or taste loss and/or lacrimation and/or decreased salivation.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning: \n(A) Reactivation of the condylar cartilage results in a protruding mandible. In the case of a child with a dished face, the condylar cartilage is only partially retracted, causing the mandible to be protruding.\n(B) Recessive maxilla rarely manifests itself in utero or neonates without structural abnormalities, making it difficult to diagnose with reliable evidence. However, it can be seen in persons with osteoporosis, craniofacial disorders, and other elevated mitochondrial concentrations in their body.\n(C) Hydrocephaly, also known as facial dysmorphias, is a rare, especially in young children, disorder that causes significant osteophyte loss and a lack of bone mass. Hydrocephaly can be diagnosed based on the size and location of the skull and mandible relative to the body.\n(D) The maxillary air sinus is part of the vestibule, lumen of the nose that is surrounded by a partial nose bridge that routes the air from the upper unilateral lesion to the lower lesion. Defective development can result from either congenital or acquired abnormalities, such as cleft palate or dental caries, causing the air sinus to narrow or dilate.   \n\nAnswer:  B (Recessive maxilla)",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "As for the first point, afferent arteriole is the most common type of blood vessel in the body. It carries blood away from tissues and organs and into the nephron, where it becomes an artery for the kidney. However, in some cases, the blood can also directly contact the glomerulus of the nephron, which also carries it along within the vessel.\r\n\r\nGlomerulus, on the other hand, is the tissue-forming part of the nephron that typically consists of huge sacs of cells together with several vascular tissues. They absorb blood and connect with the rest of the nephron to form a blood vessel. The most common type of glomerulus is on the inside of the nephron, near the renal pelvis, where it helps to relieve pressure on the tissue below.\r\n\r\nLoop of Henle, also called a capillary loop, connects the glomerulus to the lumen of the afferent arteriole. It helps to drive blood away from the nephron as it has a smaller diameter than the glomerulus. It follows the blood through the tkidney, crosses the nephron and artery, and naturally leads to the venous system, where it becomes a capillary.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the cluster of blood capillaries found in each nephron in the kidney is in afferent arteriole (A).",

Spinal cord: The sixth cervical vertebra (the one directly beneath the patient's head) was damaged.\r\n3. Damage: The damage to the spinal cord was significant enough to require surgery to repair.\r\n4. Life support: The patient lacked life support since they had not had enough years on their feet when they developed the broken neck.\r\n5. Breathe: Breathing is the conscious process of inhaling and exhaling air, and is responsible for most of the respiratory functions of a living organism.\r\n6. They: Without the fourth or sixth cervical vertebra, the patient would not be able to breathe.\r\n7.

The lumbar region cannot lie directly below the sternum as it is an artery.

If the immune system attacks a pathogen, it changes its molecular structure and natural enemy.\r\n- The skin helps protect the joints and organs from the entry of bacteria into the body.\r\n- Mucous membranes at the nose and mouth help to shed bacteria and protect the nose, which can help to prevent infections.\r\n- The osteoblasts inside the arteries help to regulate the blood flow and circulation, ensuring that oxygen is distributed evenly throughout the body.\r\n- Finally, the saliva helps to produce high amounts of oxygen for the immune system.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\n- The palatine processes are fluid-filled tissues enclosing the breast tissue, and differentiate into liver, bile duct, and pancreatic duct.\r\n- The fleshy tissues in the hands and feet pull on the breast and only the skin on the neck, armpit, and collar help to tailor the composition of the body.\r\n- The breast tissue is undergoing a lactation process, involving the sperm, ova, and eggs during the pregnancy.\r\n- During the fertilization process, the zygotes are prepared, and the resulting cell fate becomes uncertain as the embryo may not be able to conceive.\r\n- The maturation of the embryo involves the development of the germ cells and lymphatic structures, and it can take up to 20 to 30 days.\r\n- After fertilization, the sperm and ova undergo a series of rounds of secretion of their molars, resulting in the development of a sac.\r\n- Gonads, which are fluid-filled tissues that supply the body with fluids and nutrients, are protected in a non-digestible inner lining called the skin.\r\n- The skin contains many enzymes that speed up the digestion and absorption of nutrients. The skin acts as a barrier when there is excess fluid in the body.\r\n- The liver and bile duct regulate the circulation of blood, and the pancreatic duct is responsible for secretion of insulin.\r\n- The palatine processes begin to fuse during the last few weeks following the fertilization. The exact timing of the fusion is not well known, but there are some studies suggesting that the palatine processes begin to fuse at six weeks and eight weeks post-fertilization.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) bilateral contraction of antigravity limb muscles. \r\n\r\nBecause the primary motor cortex activity is related to the natural tendency of the human body to fall forward and backward, it would likely result in the contraction of the antigravity limb muscles in the direction of movement (forward and backward) to prevent the limb from moving too far away from the body axis due to the tremor of the torso. This would result in a more natural and enjoyable gait. Additionally, both limbs would be actuated in the same direction, preventing clash or injury. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we conclude that the primary motor cortex activity results in the bilateral contraction of antigravity limb muscles as the main reason for the tremor of the neck and shoulder joints in humans.",
