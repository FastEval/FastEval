            "model_answer": "We start by answering the first part of the question. \r\n\r\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly mainstream in the past few years. This is because of their unique properties and features that set them apart from other digital currencies. Some of their key features include:\r\n\r\n- Autonomous Decentralized Network: This means that no individual or group controls the bitcoin network or the ledger of transactions. This is what allows for the decentralized nature of their system.\r\n\r\n- Immutable Ledger: The ledger of transactions in bitcoin is considered to be immutable. This means that once a transaction has been verified and added to the ledger, it cannot be edited or changed.\r\n\r\n- Peer-to-Peer Network: Bitcoin uses a peer-to-peer network architecture, where each participant has equal say in verifying and maintaining the ledger of transactions. This prevents any central authority or point of control.\r\n\r\nHowever, this also brings up other ethical issues that need to be considered.\r\n\r\n- Privacy and Security: Bitcoin has varying degrees of privacy and security features. However, it still remains vulnerable to various cyberattacks.\r\n\r\n- Fraud and Cybersecurity: Bitcoin transactions are verified and added to the ledger in an automated manner, which makes them more susceptible to fraud. Additionally, bitcoin can be used as a tool for other cyber attacks, such as email spam and hacking.\r\n\r\n- Regulatory compliance: Bitcoin is still in its infancy, so there is not yet any clear regulatory compliance structure in place. However, this could change in the future, as the network has the potential to create new sources of revenue and wealth.\r\n\r\nOverall, while bitcoin is currently being used to engage in more financial activities than other currencies, it still poses some ethical issues that need to be addressed. The correct answer is D, Traditional currency, Expensive, Unsecure, Charitable giving.",

            "question": "Typical advertising regulatory bodies suggest, for example that adverts must not: encourage _________, cause unnecessary ________ or _____, and must not cause _______ offence.\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n1. Adverts must not encourage _________. . This could be interpreted as not encouraging sexual encouragement, as it implies seductive type of advertising. However, if it also meant that adverts must not promote obscene or defamatory messages, then it would make the statement more specific, and not suggest even a slight breath of insecurity. Therefore, the answer is B.\r\n2. Adverts must not cause unnecessary ________ or _____. . This could be interpreted as not encouraging unnecessary sexual attention, but also as not call for unnecessary sensual pleasures, as adverts shouldn't cause harm to the viewer at all costs. Furthermore, if it meant that adverts cannot cause a distressing sexually, it would again suggest more specificity. C is the most suitable answer.\r\n3. Adverts must not cause _______ offence. . This could be interpreted as not violating the advertising laws, but also as not being fuelled by any personal aggression. Ultimately, this doesn't specify what action causes an offence, so C is the correct answer. \r\n\r\nAnswer: (B)",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "According to the given statement, the employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities is Work-play balance. \n\nReasoning:\nBefore the advent of technologies and the internet, working hours were mostly fixed and structured, with no flexibility. With the emergence of punctuality and efficient working practices, such as mob programming, remote working, and work-from-home, the concept of work-play balance is becoming more critical, with the former working hours becoming more and more essential in modern society.\n\nIn recent years, as a result of intensification of work and technological shifts, such as remote working, hybrid work, and the proliferation of various smartphones, employees are more prone to working longer hours, shift more often, and spend more time on non-work related activities, such as socializing, games, and TV. Work-play balance is an important aspect of work culture, and a healthy work-life balance overall is crucial for success in modern workplaces.",

            "question": " _______ can be a likened to their natural counterparts, comprising of a balanced network of interdependent organisms and their environments thus adding value to sustainability thinking due to the consideration of companies and industries as being bound together, and interdependent due to all kinds of resources and wastes.\n\n(A) Industrial supply loops\n(B) Industrial ecosystems\n(C) Ecological ecosystems\n(D) Corporate ecosystems",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's start by understanding what \"natural counterparts\" means. In simple English, a \"natural counterpart\" is not a living thing, but instead, it refers to the way in which organisms interact with their environment and with each other. \r\n\r\nNow, using this understanding, we can see that \"likened to their natural counterparts\" means that companies and industries are not independent in nature. They are bound together through their interdependent interactions with other companies and industries. The interplay of these various industries and how they interact with one another, creates a balanced ecology and creates the most efficient and effective supply chains for all the needs of the consumers. \r\n\r\nFinally, Adding value to sustainability thinking can be achieved by understanding the complex ecosystem within which companies operate. This ecological ecosystem includes, but is not limited to, industrial supply loops, industrial ecosystems, and societal ecosystems. Therefore, our answer to the question is B: Industrial ecosystems, which is the appropriate ecological ecosystem to approach in order to maintain sustainability.",

            "model_answer": "Example A: \nProof: In a business-CSO collaboration, one party controls the majority of resources and the other party has limited resources. This can create power imbalance or informational asymmetries between the two parties. Suppose for example, one party possesses more resources and gains benefit by sharing resources with the other party, whereas in reality this benefit has been denied to the other party. Alternatively, one party sells resources to the other party in a way that reduces their economic interest, which can create a disproportionate advantage to the other party. These scenarios can lead to unfairness. \n\nSolution: Benefits are being denied to the other party in Example A. The risk in this scenario is unfair distribution of resources. The co-operation may not work as intended due to inefficiencies, lack of vision or poor communication and collaboration between the parties.\n\nSolution letter: B)",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\n1. Heuristics in psychology help us to make decisions based on subjective psychological factors. Hedonistic models attempt to maximize immediate pleasure and avoid unpleasant, delayed pleasure.\n\n2. This means that preferences maximize both immediate and future utility. Preference-based models, in contrast, rely on the individual's preferences to shape their behavior and aim to explain the choices people make based on their subjective preferences.\n\n3. The Categorical Imperative focuses on maximizing economic utility or achieving a desired societal outcome through a specific set of political and social institutions. This theory argues that policies and institutions should be designed to maximize their social impacts and are responsible for creating economic value for societies and individuals. \n\n4. This theory builds upon Gibb's law, which states that individual preferences and interactions with others affect the outcome of transactions. Ethics of care assumes that individuals should treat others with dignity and respect at all times. Because of this principle, ethical policies and institutions aim to establish social relationships that are beneficial to all parties and help ensure that conflicts do not escalate.\n\n5. Utilitarianism is the closet theory to the three mentioned. Utilitarianism combines several heuristics and assumptions to come up with a common objective for economic and social system design. However, it does not prescribe a specific approach, but rather provides a framework for analyzing and discussing various modelling alternatives.\n\nAnswer: B",

However, it is only the responsibility of the shareholders as a tribe to protect their interests and not of the company itself. Therefore, it is up to the shareholders to raise the level of profit by supporting societal initiatives such as providing necessary infrastructure, education, healthcare, and healthcare services.
