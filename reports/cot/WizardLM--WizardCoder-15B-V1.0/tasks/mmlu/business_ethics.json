            "question": "Typical advertising regulatory bodies suggest, for example that adverts must not: encourage _________, cause unnecessary ________ or _____, and must not cause _______ offence.\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The first choice is A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial. The use of this phrase suggests that in this particular case, the advertising industry may not be prepared to have failing adverts that encourage or cause harmful actions. However, we can also note that the word \"Unsafe\" is quite neutral in this context and could be referring to more general issues, such as cheating or fraud.\r\n\r\nThe second choice is B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious. The use of this phrase suggests that the advert may be contributing to distress or discomfort due to the nature of the advertised product or service. This may lead to more questions such as: \"How likely are other customers to take risk by agreeing to this advert?\" and \"Is it appropriate to use this code of conduct in this context, or should the advert have a less damaging or humorous tone instead?\".\r\n\r\nThe third choice is C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial. The presence of preconditions in this choice makes it less likely that the advert is directly aimed at encouraging or causing harm, but it still suggests that the advert may be attracting the attention of naive potential customers due to the title \"Wants\".\r\n\r\nFinally, the fourth choice is D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious. This choice coincides with the second choice and suggests that although the advert may still cause distress or discomfort, it does not motivate or pave the path to harm. The use of \"Safe\" is in line with the assumption that the advert will have a positive influence or effect on the target audience, but as we also note, relying on adverts is not an easy thing to defend depending on the context. Therefore, it may be worth considering other options that are more suitable for the advertising industry.",

            "question": " ______ is an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities which, due to intensification of work and technological shifts, has become a hotly contested issue in recent years.\n\n(A) Presenteeism\n(B) Absenteeism\n(C) Work-play balance\n(D) Work-life balance",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "A. Presenteeism is an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities due to intensification of work and technological shifts. Presenteeism can lead to burnout, lead to feelings of unproductive time and unhealthy relationships with colleagues and coworkers, and can result in low job satisfaction, reduced turnover rates, and increased turnover costs. Non-work related activities can include reading, studying, doing house chores, and spending time with family and friends. Presenteeism is a more effective exercise of one's time than work-life balance. The opposite to presenteeism can be absenteeism, which is an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities during off-hours or when not working. Absenteeism can lead to higher turnover rates and decreased productivity. Work-play balance is another preferred ratio that includes working in an office environment and balancing work with activities outside of work to maximize both productivity and fun. Finally, work-life balance includes being physically healthy, prioritizing work and not taking time for family, friends, and hobbies, and caring for oneself throughout the workday.",

It is often associated with natural systems, such as forests, rivers, and plants, which are the sources of organic resource in sufficient quantities to sustain ecosystems. However, the intention was to throw light on the importance of sustaining ecosystem systems, which is associated with companies and industries that emit waste in excess of consumption. This increases their direct or indirect impact on the natural environment and can cause ecological disasters such as deforestation, pollution, and animal extinction. \r\n\r\nBased on this reasoning, the answer can be inferred as B, as it is associated with industrial ecosystems.",

In such cases, they are not considered fair, even if the organization is otherwise legitimate.\n\n B. Co-operation between the CSOs and respective organizations helps to resolve power imbalances, but it also creates other problems such as incoherency, disputes, and unfairness. In such cases, a well-established brand or reputation within an organization is essential to protect against such problems.\n\n C. The asymmetries in information sharing between the CSOs and respective organizations can increase the risk of conflict, hinder collaboration, and create disputes and incoherencies. It is essential to maintain close collaboration between the organizations on a reciprocal basis to ensure fairness, independence, and quality of service.\n\n D. Co-operation can lead to efficiency gains as well; however, sharing of information negatively impacts the achievement of equity objectives and creates the risk of unfair benefits distribution.\n\nAnswer: (C) There are asymmetries in information sharing between the CSOs and respective organizations that hinder fairness, independence, and quality of service, and they create the risk of conflict, disputes, and unfair benefits distribution.",

            "question": "Although corporate profit maximization is not directly prescribed by major normative theories to which normative theory is it most similar?\n\n(A) hedonistic utilitarianism\n(B) preference utilitarianism\n(C) The Categorical Imperative\n(D) ethics of care",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nThe difference between ethics of care and the other options is that ethics of care represents the further ideal of human conduct as it is aligned with a higher level of reality\u2014rather than mere economic utilization. Utilitarianism is, instead, a normative ethics theory that offers a theory of ethical reasoning based on the observation that giving or receiving reward is a justifiable decision according to many human factors such as fairness, justice, and temperance. However, utilitarianism mainly outlines a set of ethical principles implying that the individual should act ethically in a way that is most beneficial to the welfare of the group. While this could potentially lead to a higher level of social welfare, it involves judging actions by a set of preferences embraced by the model and does not recognize the potentially aggressive, deviating, or irrational actions that are permissible in some contexts. Therefore, preference utilitarianism is a more appropriate theory for corporate profit maximization as they tend to favor the preservation of social welfare versus purely economic utilization.\r\n\r\nHedonistic utilitarianism, on the other hand, advocates a more individualistic ethical perspective. It argues that individuals should be considered objectively and free from personal bias and preferences. This theory suggests that individuals should act ethically and responsibly in pursuit of their own well-being and are willing to make potentially costly transactions to benefit their own well-being. However, it does not contemplate the social benefits that could result from various corporate policies and actions.\r\n\r\nCategorical imperative, on the other hand, addresses ethical concerns from a categorical imperative perspective that outlines a rational and neutral ethical God, who coordinates moral principles and enacts them universally. However, this perspective tends to oversimplify morality and disregard critical aspects such as the incentive to act ethically or the importance of social and environmental benefit. Therefore, the Categorical Imperative is not a good fit for corporate profit maximization as it is not compatible with the complexities of human behavior.\r\n\r\nTherefore, although corporate profit maximization is not directly prescribed by major normative theories, preference utilitarianism is a good choice as it offers a theoretical framework that is more suitable for maximizing social welfare rather than just economic gain.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the central idea:\r\n\r\nThe central idea is that regulation goes further than just legal and policy considerations, and that CSOs have more to do with businesses than just legal and compliance.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Rephrase the central idea:\r\n\r\nRegulation goes beyond legal and policy considerations in that it impacts businesses\u2019 interactions and mechanisms, while CSOs also bear some relationship with businesses, whether that be through legal or functional means.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Ask for the purpose of the passage:\r\n\r\nThe passage is clarifying the relationship between regulation, CSOs, and businesses, and as such it offers a possible answer to the question within the given context.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Identify potential answers:\r\n\r\nThere are four possible answers to this question: A, B, C, and D. \r\n\r\nOf these four answers, the correct answer is option A. \r\n\r\nOption A: Legal, Interactions, Mechanics.\r\n\r\nThis answer is most likely because the passage is referring to regulation going beyond just legal and policy issues, and that CSOs also have a role in businesses\u2019 interactions and mechanisms. The passage also maintains that the regulatory environment impacts businesses\u2019 outcomes and therefore the need for CSOs to work closely with business leaders and stakeholders to ensure adequate regulation and oversight. It is intertwined with the CSO\u2019s responsibilities for consulting with stakeholders, attending meetings with legislators, and representing the interests of businesses and stakeholders.\r\n\r\nOption B: Civil, Relations, Outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis answer is also most likely because the passage is related to businesses\u2019 interactions with CSOs in terms of civil relationships, and it considers CSOs\u2019 elevated role in the business world. The regulation landscape is typically subject to regulatory pressure from businesses, and it can be easy for CSOs to take a backseat when it comes to resolving issues and resolving conflicts. This can have an impact on businesses\u2019 outcomes, which is due to their ability to influence legislation or lobbying for changes.\r\n\r\nOption C: Political, Interactions, Outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis answer is also plausible, but it is worth noting that the passage is not attempting to define political or legal interventions. It focuses more on how CSOs play an active role in businesses\u2019 interactions and interactions with legislators, and the impact that CSOs have on political decisions and outcomes for businesses.\r\n\r\nOption D: Environmental, Relations, Mechanics.\r\n\r\nThis answer is the least likely, but it could be correct depending on the perspective on regulatory processes. The passage suggests that regulation not only impacts businesses\u2019 interactions and mechanisms, but also their relationships with the environment and the impacts they can have on the communities they operate in. It is also worth noting that the passage does not make any implied suggestion that CSOs play any crucial role in shaping the regulatory environment.",
