            "question": "Which foods tend to be consumed in lower quantities in Wales and Scotland (as of 2020)?\n\n\n(A) Meat\n(B) Confectionary\n(C) Fruits and vegetables\n(D) Potatoes",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is B - Confectionary.\r\n\r\nReasoning:\r\n\r\nThe primary reason the answer is Confectionary is that it is the second most common food item consumed by Scotland and Wales in 2020. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Scotland and Wales rarely consume dairy drinks and snacks, and the majority of their dietary choices are eaten as a part of meals or snacks. This is in stark contrast to the United Kingdom (UK), which typically makes up the highest proportion of the world's population and far exceeds the population of Scotland and Wales. Thus, it's no surprise the confectionary is the second most popular food choice for the two nations. \r\n\r\nScotland's largest source of non-dairy products are their baked goods such as pies, cakes, and breads, which often come in confectionary wrappers. In contrast, Wales has very few baked goods and only a few confectionaries, which are typically sandwiches or wraps themselves. Overall, Confectionary is the predominant food in Scotland and Wales.",

            "question": "In which one of the following circumstances will the prevalence of a disease in the population increase, all else being constant?\n\n\n(A) If the incidence rate of the disease falls.\n(B) If survival time with the disease increases.\n(C) If recovery of the disease is faster.\n(D) If the population in which the disease is measured increases.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "A) If the incidence rate of the disease falls.\r\n\r\nIf the incidence rate of the disease falls, this means the number of cases of the disease per 100,000 people has fallen. This means that people are less likely to be exposed to the disease, leading to fewer cases being diagnosed and hospitalized. However, this does not account for all the factors that contribute to the prevalence of the disease. A scenario where the prevalence increases is when there are more cases diagnosed, but they are still being treated in the best way possible. If this is the case, the incidence rate of the disease does not significantly increase, and the prevalence will remain stagnant or even decrease.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the disease is spreading too rapidly, then the prevalence will increase regardless of the change in the incidence rate. For example, if there are fewer cases being diagnosed in an area, then people may begin to seek treatment for the disease, which increases their risk of infection. This means that the incidence rate may actually decrease, but the prevalence of the disease will still increase.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements is correct?\n\n\n(A) The flavonoid class comprises flavonoids and isoflavonoids.\n(B) The digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones in soya food products are not changed by processing.\n(C) \u00df-Carotene and lycopene can both act as provitamin A.\n(D) Carotenoids and flavonoids both belong to the polyphenol class.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nStatement A: Correct - according to the most recent GBIF classification scheme for flavonoids, the flavonoid class includes flavonoids and isoflavonoids. In this classification, flavonoids are defined as chemical compounds that have a flavonoid structure (i.e., bonded to a central carbon), and isoflavonoids are those that are isoelectrophiles but have no flavonoid bond. \r\n\r\nStatement B: Incorrect - the digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones in soya food products may be impacted by processing, such as minor adjustments in the structure of the polysaccharide chains. However, the structures of these isoflavones are expected to remain essentially unchanged in processed form. \r\n\r\nStatement C: Incorrect - \u00df-carotene and lycopene are not considered provitamin A, as they are also considered to be polymeric nucleotides that decrease in abundance with increasing pH. However, some researchers have gone as far as to propose a functional role for these compounds in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation, although this has not been tested in humans. \r\n\r\nStatement D: Incorrect - neither carotenoids nor flavonoids belong to the polyphenol class, as these classes are intended to represent a mix of different polyphenolic complexes, some of which may be composed of multiple monomers. Polyphenols comprise compounds that are highly hydrophilic and tend to form covalent bonds to the protein backbone of eukaryotic cells. The class polyphenols is not applicable to soya products, as these compounds do not exist in soya.",

Vitamin K is also a major nutrient for insulin, which helps in the maintenance and repair of cells in the body. However, one of its main roles in controlling free radicals is as a lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes, which is important for maintaining a good red blood cell count and reducing the risk of coronary heart disease. Therefore, Vitamin K is a major lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes.\n\nTo choose the correct answer depends on the context.

            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n(A) Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor: This contributes to vitamin B12 deficiency as it promotes the development of increased tissue levels of B12, leading to lowered production of B12 in the body.\r\n\r\n(B) Atrophic gastritis: This contributes to vitamin B12 deficiency by reducing the absorption of B12 in the colon, leading to reduced production of B12 in the body.\r\n\r\n(C) Helicobacter pylori infection: This contributes to vitamin B12 deficiency by increasing acute inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, leading to an impairment of B12 synthesis, which in turn leads to lower B12 levels in the body.\r\n\r\n(D) All of the above: Combining all the above factors contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency. Over the course of the life span, these factors may exacerbate the condition leading to a slow, gradual loss of B12 levels.\r\n\r\nAnswer: (C) - Helicobacter pylori infection contributes to vitamin B12 deficiency.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Thyroxine. \r\n\r\nIt is thought that obesity is one of the risk factors for developing endometrial cancer, and the release of a growth hormone called thyroxine is a key mediator. Thyroxine is responsible for regulating the growth of both testicles and ovaries and hence plays a crucial role in the control of hormone-driven cell growth, especially in women. Therefore, it is speculated that obesity could increase the risk of developing endometrial cancer by indirectly influencing the release of thyroxine.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is Vitamin A. \n\nThis is because the small intestine is essential to our body's inner health and covers the majority of our calories. Vitamin A helps our body absorb calcium from the dietary supplements we provide and prevents calcium deficiency, which can cause harmful inflammation and immune system damage. Vitamin A is found predominantly in fruits and vegetables, but also in polysaccharides found in raw food sources. Therefore, it is essential for our body's inner health.",

In general, the layers of the nutrition cycle are:\r\n\r\n1. Dietary intake: The meals eaten by the individual and the quantities of each ingredient consumed.\r\n2. Preprocessed foods: Foods that have been processed and prepared for consumption, such as rice cakes or bean sprouts.\r\n3. Mid-course energy and proteinuria: The amount of energy required by the body to maintain normal body temperature and body functions.\r\n4. Post-meal transfusions: The change in electrolytes that occur after eating.\r\n5. Metabolism and physical activity: The movement of nutrients and wastes throughout the body and the regulation of hormones and factors that regulate body functions.\r\n6. Quality of life: The overall health, well-being, and satisfaction of the individual.\r\n\r\nIn regards to the human amino acid requirements, the requirements for adults, maintenance for all ages and the amino acid pattern of breast milk are assumed to be correct because these are generalized amino acid requirements. Infant and young child amino acid requirements are dependent on the age of the individual, as they have different metabolic rates and require different intake patterns.\r\n\r\nThus, the correct answer is (D) The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children.
