            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n1. A disease is being eliminated from the population by the decrease in its incidence rate. Therefore, the prevalence of the disease is expected to increase if the incidence rate falls.\r\n\r\n2. Disease development can also be influenced by medications, such as antibiotics, that can reduce the incidence rate of the disease. Therefore, the prevalence of the disease may increase even if the incidence rate falls if the medication is used in compliance with medical guidelines.\r\n\r\n3. Having access to healthcare services that provide antiviral drugs and prevention programs may also contribute to the recovery time of the disease, which can further reduce the prevalence of the disease.\r\n\r\n4. Administering more tests and surveys that include population subgroups that are more likely to be infected may also increase the prevalence of the disease. This could occur even if the incidence rate remains the same.\r\n\r\nAnswer:C. The prevalence of a disease can be expected to increase if recovery is faster and/or if the population is becoming overburdened with the disease. This is because recovery processes in humans may take longer than in other species, and a population that is becoming overburdened with the disease may be more susceptible to transmission of the disease. The prevalence of a disease can also increase if the incidence rate falls and/or if hospitals are overwhelmed with patients. These actions may contribute to sustained transmission of the disease within the population.",

            "model_answer": "Main causes of obesity epidemic are:\r\n\r\n1. Increased Physical Activity: Physical activity has been shown to decrease the weight gain of individuals and decrease the risk of developing obesity later in life. Physical activity such as running, jogging, cycling, walking, swimming and general exercise can boost the adiposity levels in individuals and result in lower body fat percentages.\r\n\r\n2. Genetics: Genetic variations in different areas of the body can cause obesity. These variations can be present in families and thereby become transmitted to the next generation. Individuals who are genetically susceptible to obesity have a higher risk of developing it later in life as a result of genetic factors.\r\n\r\n3. Alcohol and Tobacco Use: Alcohol and tobacco use can lead to an increase in body fat, even after exercising regularly. Since these substances are high in carbohydrates, they can promote the growth of large amounts of body fat, which can lead to obesity.\r\n\r\n4. Mental Health Issues: The dangers of obesity and overweight depend on the individual's overall health status and mental health. Overweight individuals are more likely to have depression symptoms and at times, have psychological issues related to their health. Alcoholism and other substance use can also have negative health implications and lead to obesity.\r\n\r\nAnswer:C) Genetic Profiles and Alcohol Use (A mark for individuals who do not focus on exercise and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle, resulting in an increased risk of obesity later in life).",

Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor: This could be due to elevated lipids or reduced insulin levels, leading to the need for increased intake of intrinsic factors, such as vitamin B12 and iron.\r\n\r\n2. Atrophic gastritis: This is a symptom of B12 deficiency where the digestive tract becomes weakened and incapable of absorbing and processing healthy fats. Gastric acid secretion is also reduced, resulting in stomach pains.\r\n\r\n3. Helicobacter pylori infection: This infection is rare but might be inherited or acquired through family history. It is caused by bacteria that inhabit the intestines and can lead to damage to the lining of the stomach.\r\n\r\nBased on the available evidence and reasoning, it seems that all the above factors could contribute to the vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C).\r\n\r\nTo answer this question, we need to understand what amino acids are, how they are produced, and what their role in the metabolic system is.\r\n\r\nAmino acids are small molecules made of three hydroxyl and three amide functional groups. They are essential amino acids that are synthesized in the cell and are involved in various processes, including protein synthesis, transport, and regulation of cellular functions.\r\n\r\nThe primary production of amino acids occurs in the inner mitochondria, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of amino acids in the form of smaller molecules such as arginines and aspartates. The cells also synthesize cholesterol, which plays a significant role in cellular stamina and is used to regulate body weight, hair growth, and insulin sensitivity.\r\n\r\nAmino acids are responsible for the regulation of a range of cellular functions and they are used in various ways. They can be synthesized only when glucose and oxygen are available, which, in turn, leads to the increased production of amino acids. They contribute to cellular energy production, cell adhesion, bacteria growth, and the formation of specific protein complexes.\r\n\r\nThe majority of amino acids (amino acids excluding arginine and aspartate) are used for protein synthesis. Arginine and aspartate are responsible for the regulation of biochemical processes, which further contribute to their economic value.\r\n\r\nThe metabolic demand for amino acids involves the synthesis of protein and the production of other macromolecules, such as carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids. The demand is determined by the organism's diet and is largely determined by the rate at which these macromolecules are synthesized, transported, and used by cells. The demand can vary over time and some amino acids can be synthesized by cellular processes, whereas others are synthesized in the extracellular environments.\r\n\r\nOverall, the statement \"The metabolic demand for amino acids involves consumption of amino-acids by a number of irreversible pathways and these are either obligatory or adaptive.\" is not strictly true, as the demand for amino acids can be affected by a range of factors, such as cellular conditions, the availability and use of hormones, and the evolving nature of biotechnology. However, the selection of unlikely pathways, such as the synthesis of alternative peptides, often reduces the demand for amino acids.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct statement is A: The amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all ages.\r\n\r\nReasoning:\r\nA pattern in amino acid requirements for all ages implies that most hormones, such as insulin, growth hormone, and testosterone, act to control the pattern of amino acid requirements across all ages. Since the amino acids are necessary for normal cell function, maintenance of the amino acid requirements is crucial to keeping our bodies healthy and functioning properly. However, the amino acid requirements can differ by age, gender, race, and cultural background. Therefore, it is advisable to make nutritional adjustments as needed to maintain a healthy amino acid profile. For example, certain foods or diets may intensify the requirement for certain amino acids or may reduce the levels of others. Therefore, the amino acid pattern determined for adults may be outdated or inappropriate for younger children, but the pattern is still applicable for adults.",
