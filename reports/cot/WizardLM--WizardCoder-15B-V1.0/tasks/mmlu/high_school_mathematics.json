This property is known as the squared prime factor theorem. This theorem states that every positive integer has at least one possible prime factor that is greater or equal to the square root of the number.\r\nFor example, in the number 18, the prime factorization is p=2^2 * 3^1. The largest factor 3^1 has square greater than 3^1 itself, so 3^1 = 9, which is a factor of 18 but not of its square. Thus, 18 is not a powerful number.\r\n\r\nTo prove the square prime factor theorem, we need to prove that if n has a prime factor greater than or equal to the square root of n, then there exists a prime factor p greater than or equal to the square root of n such that p^2 is a factor of n. To do this, we can start by factoring n into its prime factors p1 * p2 * ... * pn and observe that there exists at least one prime factor pi such that pi^2 >= pi * sqrt(n), where pi >= p1 * p2 * ... * pn/2. But since pi is a factor of n, we also know that pi^2 >= n/pi >= n/(pi^2) >= n/pi, hence by the square root of n identity we have pi >= sqrt(n). This means that p1 * p2 * ... * pn < pi <= n/2 and we can repeat the process for another factor.\r\nSince there are at least two factors needed to make pi >= sqrt(n), hence there exists at least one prime factor p_1^2 >= p1^2 and another prime factor p_2^2 >= p2^2, etc. We also know that the product of the powers of these prime factors is greater than or equal to the power of the largest one, i.e., p_1^k * p_2^2 * ... * p_m^k >= p_1^k * p_2^k * ... * p_m^k, where p_m is the largest one and 2 <= m <= n. We can factor n into the first two prime factors separately, and if p_1^k >= sqrt(p1) and p_2^k >= sqrt(p2), then n is powerful for any k that satisfies this condition.\r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\nThe answer is A.",
