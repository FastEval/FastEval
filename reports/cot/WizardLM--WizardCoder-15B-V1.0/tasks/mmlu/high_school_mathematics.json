            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nTo reflect a polygon across a line, each vertex of the polygon is moved in a certain direction to form the new polygon. So, for example, if we have a polygon P with vertices A, B, C, D, and E with respect to a line p connecting AB and CD, we can reflect the polygon across the line p to get P\u201f with vertices W, X, Y, Z, and T where each vertex W is the reflection of A across p, and so on. We can see that the new polygon satisfies the condition that the line p is perpendicular to the line connecting the initial vertices of P.\r\n\r\nTo reflect a pentagon across the line y = x, we need to find a line l perpendicular to y = x that passes through the point (0, 0). In this case, l is the line that passes through the point (1, 1). By picking any vertex of the pentagon that is not on the line y = x, such as vertex E, we can construct two lines through it to form a pair of diagonals of the pentagon. These lines intersect at the point (0, 0) as they are perpendicular to y = x. To reflect each vertex of the pentagon across this line, we need to move it in the opposite direction to the line connecting its reflection point to the original vertex.\r\n\r\nVertex E is not on the line y = x, so vertex F is the reflection of E across l. We can see that F = (0, 4), as desired.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the new vertex of the reflected pentagon P\u2019 is F = (0, 4). The answer is (B) (4, 1).",
