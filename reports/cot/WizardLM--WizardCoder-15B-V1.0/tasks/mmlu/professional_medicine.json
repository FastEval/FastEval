            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

The patient has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh, and she has had to sit at a hospital for 3 weeks to receive the anticoagulant discontinuation. This makes her most likely suspect to be an IVCF (complication of the IVCF placement) because of the duration of the hospitalization. \r\n\r\nThe patient has symptoms of cerebrovascular disease during the hospitalization which can cause decreased sensation of numbness and tingling in some parts of the body.\r\n\r\nBased on this, the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is IVC (compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve). \r\n\r\nThe answer is: C.",

            "question": "A 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female is admitted to the hospital at 39\u00a0weeks' gestation in active labor. She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated. The most likely diagnosis is\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions\n(B) lower uterine retraction ring\n(C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction\n(D) primary dysfunctional labor",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n- At a 25-year-old age, gestation is at its peak and is usually considered an advanced stage in the labor progression. \r\n- Contractions, while the most common type of labor contraction, are not the only type of contractions that could occur. However, with no obvious reason for obstructed labor, it would be hard to determine the exact type of contractions, just that the patient has only a few of them, if any.\r\n- The diagnosis could be based on the observation made during the examination, specifically the headaches, pus and general feeling of discomfort. Obstructed labor typically results in headaches, pain and discomfort to the neck and arms, followed by a high-pitched noise during labor or delivery, which can be heard up to 20\u00a0minutes after labor eosinophilia. PCOD (primary complications of delivering a fetus) can also be the cause of these symptoms.\r\n- The examination findings indicate that the cervix is dilated, whereas all other accessory organs and organs in the fetus are intact, making it difficult to ascertain the cause of the contractions.\r\n- Finally, the diagnosis of a primary dysfunctional labor cannot be ruled out. PCOD, lower uterine retraction ring, hypotonic uterine dysfunction can all occur as a result of obstructed labor and could contribute to the diagnosis. However, PCOD is viewed as a complication that can occur at any stage of labor due to various events, such as blood loss or loss of cells in the bile duct. \r\n\r\nAnswer:The correct diagnosis is A, Braxton Hicks contractions.",

            "question": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of numbness in her right hand. During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?\n\n(A) Median nerve at the wrist\n(B) Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm\n(C) Radial nerve at the forearm\n(D) Ulnar nerve at the elbow",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "1. Identifying the symptoms: A 2-month history of numbness in her right hand, tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time, had been reported. These symptoms might be the initial indication of entrapment but more detailed examination would be necessary to establish the cause.\r\n\r\n2. Spontaneous movement: The woman comes to the physician for a routine check-up that requires her to stand and move around. When she starts moving, she feels dizzy and numbness suddenly starts in her right ring and small fingers. This is further confirmed by palpation and sensation testing. \r\n\r\n3. Associating the symptoms with spontaneous movement: A 2-month history of numbness and tingling symptoms in the right ring and small fingers could be caused by a persistent constriction of the fingers with the palm of the hand. This might be a sign of entrapment. \r\n\r\n4. The nerve at the elbow: No physical examination has revealed the cause of entrapment of the right elbow. More empirical studies would be necessary to establish the exact nerve involved. \r\n\r\n5. Possible causes: There are different possible causes for entrapment of the right elbow, such as intracranial pressure, tissue damage, nerve entrapment due to bleeding or trauma, or pathological neural circuits. Here, the symptoms are consistent with pathological neural circuits. \r\n\r\n6. Nominal cause: Medial nerve at the wrist is less likely to be involved in entrapment of the right elbow than the other possible causes. However, this association should be confirmed by further testing. \r\n\r\n7. Definitive cause: Despite the possible contribution of other possible causes, the most likely cause of entrapment of the right elbow is musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm. \r\n\r\n8. Option (A): Median nerve at the wrist represents a possible cause of entrapment of the right elbow, but not the only possible cause. Other possible causes include radial nerve at the forearm, musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm, or ulnar nerve at the elbow. \r\n\r\n9. Returning to the physician: Based on the findings, the physician would consider musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm to be the most likely cause of the tingling and numbness in the right elbow. The diagnosis would likely involve a nerve incision and injection and monitoring of symptoms for several months to establish the full etiology.",

The study involves muscle biopsy specimens obtained from the subjects during the resting state.\r\n\r\n3. The specification of the group of subjects as healthy indicates that no medical conditions such as cardiovascular or neurologic disease affect their metabolism. \r\n\r\n4. The increased malonyl-CoA concentration indicates elevated levels of dietary maltose intake and air pollution. \r\n\r\n5. According to the literature, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia induce the synthesis of glucose into its glycan-forming component glucogen. The increased malonyl-CoA concentration whose presence could be a minor consequence of glycogenolism may have a limited effect on the metabolic rate. \r\n\r\n6. Fatty acid synthesis in the liver and muscle may be impaired in subjects who suffer from elevated malonyl-CoA levels. Specifically, gluconeogenesis, which creates glucose from glycogen, is reported to be impaired in subjects with elevated malonyl-CoA levels. \r\n\r\n7. Fatty acid synthesis relies on the synthesis of amino acids and amino acids depend on the cellular and organic nutrients present in the body.\r\n\r\n8.
