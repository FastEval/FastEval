            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "My reasoning for this question is as follows:\nMurtis means \"evil\" in French. \nIn English, \"murtis\" refers to a symbol of the dead. A dead deer, a dead man, a deceased murderer, etc. are all referred to as \"murdered\" by many people and it's all those \"murders\" that revolve around murtis. \nOn the other hand, \"murtis\" is a Christian ritual meaning \"offering\" or \"sacrifice\". \nThis may be why the question is asking about the word \"murtis\" in particular. The answer is that it can be translated as either \"offerings\" or \"prayers\". \nI believe \"offerings\" would be the more appropriate answer.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "A. Daoism\r\n\r\nReasoning:\r\nNaturalists who focused on natural elements and processes are known as Daoist naturalists. Daoism claims that the Earth is a tsunami of energy and matter. Daoists believe that the Moon was created by an ancient civilization with natural energy. Daoists believe that the Earth was created in an ancient bubble of matter, and this bubble cannot be dissolved or recreated. Daoists advocate that man should conquer nature, which includes the destruction of the Earth and its natural resources. \r\n\r\nAlternate reasoning:\r\nDaoism clearly asserts that the Earth is instead a tsunami of energy and matter. Daoists maintain that we see the Moon because it is a remnant of the ancient civilization who created it, and that the Earth was created in a bubble of matter. Daoists argue that conquering nature involves activities such as protecting the natural environment, draining the oceans, increasing agricultural productivity, and investing in sustainable industries. However, they are not opposed to religious dogma that denotes some natural elements as the cause of the creation of man. This is mainly because religion has endless and complex rhetoric, and the religious dogma may operate within a good framework of ethics and morality. \r\n\r\nReference: https://www.britannica.com/science/Daoism",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:When was the first Buddhist temple constructed in Japan? \r\n\r\nA possible answer is that it was constructed in late 325 CE. \r\n\r\nJapan was under Japanese rule until the Meiji Restoration and the Koshien Era. During this time, Buddhism was a relatively new cultural force and no Buddhist temples were constructed. \r\n\r\nHowever, during the first decade of the Meiji Restoration, many temples were constructed in Japan, including the Hakone Japanese Buddhist Monastery, built on the Hakone River in Kyoto, Japan. \r\n\r\nOther temples, such as the S\u00e9ila Oda Samhita Buddhist Monastery built in Southern Japan in the early 1920s, and the Futonji Kihon Buddhist Monastery built in Kyoto in the second half of the 20th century, were constructed after the Meiji Restoration. \r\n\r\nAll these temples were located on Japan's western coastline and were part of the Guam Strip inhabited by Buddhist villagers during the Meiji period. However, it is probable that the temple construction started earlier than 325 CE, but the earliest documented events are dubious. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we can conclude that the first Buddhist temple constructed in Japan was in the early 1920s or early 325 CE, but it remains to be proven whether that is the exact date. \r\n\r\nAnswer:B) 119 CE (The first documented Buddhist temple constructed in Japan is located in Hakone, Kyoto, Japan, built by <NAME> in 119 CE (meaning it was made after the Meiji period). Other temples were also constructed in Japan, but none are known to be located in the Guam Strip during the Meiji period.)",

            "model_answer": "Guru Nanak and his successors instructed the use of particular Sikh Ragas in order to promote the balance between harmony and royalty. Here is the explanation step-by-step:\n\n1. Guru Nanak had a deep understanding of the Sikh teachings and believed in unity.\n\n2. Therefore, the Raga Krushna, which promotes strength, was chosen as his spiritual guide. It not only encourages attunement with the spiritual forces, but also enables him to purify the mind through meditation and prayer.\n\n3. Next, Karma Yoga, while also being associated with the Golden Path, encourages the individual to follow a Harvard-like path of rationality, compassion, and love towards others. It balances the values of generosity, benevolence, and inclusiveness.\n\n4. Finally, Bhaargu Raga was chosen as his spiritual guide during times of turmoil, not only because of its calmness and peace, but also because it leads to a collective and mutual understanding of the world and how to move forward. It explores the paradoxes of the human condition and encourages the development of humility and compassion towards all beings.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is option (C): Devotion and piety. None of this has anything to do with love or passion, and only encourages an inner balance that can lead to the promotion of harmony and goodwill between all.",

            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nThe mi'raj is a symbolic name for the revelations or meditations of the prophet Muhammad. It is widely used in the Islamic community as a reference to the prophet's teachings, insights, and influential role in the Western religions. In Arabic, the mi'raj literally means \"mentorship\", \"advisor\", \"rescue\".\r\n\r\nThe mi'raj is a branch of Christianity where prognosticators or prophets suggest a future in a biblical formula that assumes the prophet's control over the future. Different mi'raj systems have been promulgated over time, but Muhammad's mi'raj has been the official one since the Qur'an's verses began to be explained, promulgated, and adapted.\r\n\r\nThe four possible answers are:\r\n\r\n(A) Muhammad's miraculous ascent to heaven\r\n(B) Muhammad's migration to Mecca\r\n(C) Muhammad's first community in Mecca\r\n(D) Muhammad's revelations of the Qur'an\r\n\r\nEach answer is self-explanatory. The answer that fits the context is the correct one to select and it is (D): \"Muhammad's revelations of the Qur'an\". However, Muhammad's stated objective was to ensure the salvation of the mankind. Hence, it's natural to use the precept and act of repentance as an example of revelation and inspiration to the people of the world. This view is supported by the Qur'an and epistles.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, here's why:\r\n\r\n1. Laws of Dharma: This is important because Laws of Dharma is the name of the 7 dharmashastras that are considered to be the most famous in India. It is an early form of Buddhist philosophy which explains the nature of reality, modern man's faculties, and individual enlightenment. Laws of Dharma is referred to as the foundation of Buddhism for centuries, and it is also the inspiration for many Indian folk and religious movements. Hence, Laws of Dharma is undoubtedly the most famous dharmashastras in India. \r\n\r\n2. Laws of Karma: Laws of Karma is also a famous dharmashastras from the Brahmanical tradition of India. It is a collection of verbal laws that describe the relationship between the actions and the results of human actions. It also teaches how to observe the five senses, observe the body, and understand the nature of experience. Laws of Karma is considered more holistic than Laws of Dharma in that it prepares the individual for spiritual realization. It also teaches practical skills for living and working with clarity and balance. \r\n\r\n3. Laws of Vishnu: Laws of Vishnu is also a famous dharmashastras from the early Buddhist tradition. It is a collection of verbal laws that guide people in their daily lives to meditate on the four noble truths, the nature of all phenomena, the divine origin of the universe, and to cultivate compassion towards all beings. Laws of Vishnu is a compelling yet practical explanation of the mysteries of the universe based on the natural world. It is unique because it explains the existence of the Buddha and his teachings throughout history. \r\n\r\n4. Laws of Manu: Laws of Manu is also a famous dharmashastras from the Brahmanical tradition of India. It is a collection of verbal laws that guide the Buddhist practice of non-violence and non-suffering. It explains what is and is not beneficial to oneself and others. It also sets the foundation for the meditation practice and the training of the mind. \r\n\r\n\r\nBased on this reasoning, the most famous dharmashastras, which probably dates from around the first century, is Laws of Dharma. Since Laws of Dharma is an early form of Buddhist philosophy, its influence is still felt throughout India today.",
