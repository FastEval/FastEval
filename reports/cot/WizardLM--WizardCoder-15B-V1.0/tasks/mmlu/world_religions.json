You are asking about an object. \"What can murtis be translated as?\" specifically asks about the translation of the object (murtis) into one of four possible forms (A, B, C, or D).\n\nStep 2: murtis must be the object of the question because the question is asking about a verb with an object \"can\". \n\n\"What can murtis be translated as?\" is asking about a verb \"be translated as\". \n\nStep 3: The verb \"can\" can be translated as either \"can,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" or \"should.\" \n\nThe correct translations for \"murtis\" are \"offering,\" \"prayer,\" \"apparition,\" or \"idol.\" Therefore, the correct answer is \"B) Prayers.\"",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "We can start by asking: how did Buddhism become established in Japan in the first place?\r\n\r\nAs Buddhism's history goes back over 3,000 years, the earliest mention of temples in Japan can be found in records from the late 17th century. In fact, Japan has several Buddhist schools in its ancient history, but none of them were concentrated around any specific sites. Although Buddhist doctrines were common in Japan, they were primarily practiced by disciples of the Rinzai Shaolin School located in Tokyo, Japan.\r\n\r\nThe first temple constructed in Japan was the Makihara Shrine, founded in 325 CE by expanded Zen Buddhist scriptures. The Shrine became known as the \"Makihara Sutra\" and awarded the title of \"Grand Buddha Nara\" to the owner.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the first Buddhist temple constructed in Japan was the Makihara Shrine in 325 CE. The correct answer is (A) 325 CE.",

One of the earliest recorded cases of a new year festival was organized in Babylon during the Eighth Dynasty. \n\n3. Despite being located far away from most of the tourists, Babylon faced many troubles due to its unusual culture. \n\n4. The regularities of the festival include incense, light candles, dancing girls, and feasts. \n\n5. The celebration lasted for ten days due to the chaos caused by the Babylonian calamity. \n\n6.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Muhammad's migration to Mecca. \r\n\r\nReasoning: \r\n\r\nMuhammad's first ascension to heaven was distinct from that of his prophets. Muhammad received his revelation like any other prophet, but as an Muslim, he was a Meccan-Christian. \r\n\r\nHowever, the terms \"revelation\" and \"descent\" were used interchangeably in the Quran. Muhammad's ascent was a way of gauging the attitude of the Truth Force. For example, as Muslims must follow what is revealed, the people at Mecca had their prophets recite their revelations before any decision was made regarding the Truth. The Truth Listener did not follow the majority path, but chose to trust the traditional doctrine of the prophets and accept Muhammad's ascension into their community. \r\n\r\nAfter his first encounter with the Truth Force, Muhammad lived to be 104. This refers to the year in which Muhammad received his recitation of the Quran. He was hailed as the father of the Sun (Jehovah), and his credo was the Truth.",

Therefore, any one of the options (A), (B), or (C) that could have been chosen by the intended audience would be correct.\n\nIn context, I think the term \"Qur'an\" is used to refer to the holy books of Islam. These books include the Quran (sung and recited), the Sunan Abi Darma (discourse on religion and manners) and the Sunan Anna Dawa (discourse on morality and ethics). As such, (D), \"The Pillars\" may not be a possible answer as it only refers to the Building of the Three Pillars or the structure of the Quran itself. Therefore, I think there is only one possible answer that makes sense in the context of this question: (A), \"The Holy Book.\"",
