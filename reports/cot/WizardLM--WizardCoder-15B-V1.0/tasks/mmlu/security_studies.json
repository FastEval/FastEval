It requires us to be responsive to ecological changes, including habitat degradation, loss of biodiversity, overfishing and other human-induced disturbances. It is essential to take immediate action to protect the environment from harmful impacts of human activities. The principle applies to all kinds of organisms such as plants, animals, wildlife and rocks.",

So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal.

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "model_answer": "We have an impassioned call for action on increasing energy security and climate change mitigation. In light of the recent revelations of climate change and the deepening crisis in human induced climate change, we are all experiencing the effects of climate change on our planet.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is necessary to take a fresh look at the energy security system of our world. In a world based on energy compression, we need to address the root causes of energy scarcity. The answer to this question lies in (B), as energy scarcity is likely to lead to exponential (and sometimes irreversible) changes in the energy system. This is particularly pertinent as we move into a post-CO\u2082-driven warming world, where such an increase in carbon dioxide concentration is not simply a byproduct of human activities but an unavoidable byproduct of our long-term survival.\r\n\r\nThe 'new international energy order' proposition is also interesting. As we leave the industrial era, we will enter a new global energy order where natural resources come under a closer and more stable monopoly. Natural resources such as oil and gas are vastly undervalued relative to utility-scale energy production, leading to domestic energy explosions and scarcity of important fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nLastly, we believe that civil war is not a solution to the energy problem and we need to use political solutions such as negotiations between states and international bodies to address energy access, investment and trade issues.\r\n\r\nBased on these reasons, our liberal perspective on future energy security is D. (D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\n1. Human security is neo-colonial:\r\n- Human security is correlated with colonialism.\r\n- In the past, the European empire was divided into two states: the British Empire and the French empire. \r\n- These two empires shared sufficient territory but were ruled by different people and cultures. \r\n- The colonialism in human security refers to the idea that increasingly powerful countries like the British Empire and China are using their influence to expand their colonies and spread their culture into regions where they do not have enough power. \r\n- As such, the concept of human security is neo-colonial. \r\n\r\n2. Human security promotes global capitalism:\r\n- The idea of human security was envisioned to address the issue of exploitation of labor, industrial upgrading, and foreign influence. \r\n- However, the final point before human security became popular is the rise of capitalism in the 20th century. \r\n- Global capitalism is the power-hungry system of production that relies on the accumulation of vast amounts of capital that is then distributed globally. \r\n- As such, human security promotes global capitalism. \r\n\r\n3. Human security is too broad:\r\n- Human security is a complex concept that involves all kinds of institutions, policies, and institutions.\r\n- For instance, the concept of national security involves policing, arms control, military training, and execution of terrorists. \r\n- Other policies that affect human security are education, healthcare, transportation, and education. \r\n- As such, human security is too broad and might not fit into a single framework. \r\n\r\n4. All of these options:\r\n- Option A is related to the idea of neo-colonialism. \r\n- Option B is related to the idea of global capitalism. \r\n- Option C is related to the idea of too broadness. \r\n- Option D is right, because all four options are correct.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

The US has also been instrumental in harmonizing legislation, standardizing civilian penalties and establishing a safe haven for criminal organizations. The US has also begun to strengthen its support for international institutions and the growing role of technological innovation in law enforcement. Overall, the US has defended its commitment to international cooperation and non-state actors as a key driver for intensifying the response to TNC.",

            "model_answer": "Persian Gulf strategy is adopted by the USA to secure their energy source and economic dominance. USA has made attempts to conquer Persian Gulf in several ways, one of which was by deploying troops. The USA made use of these tactics in order to seize control of the Persian oil blockade and escalate their presence in the energy market, both in terms of military operations and international trade. In this case, the strategy adopted by the USA was to establish itself as the dominant power in the Persian Gulf region by holding off rival powers and promoting its own economic development agenda. As a result, the deployment of troops and other interventions during raids on oil rigs in the Persian Gulf, coupled with the successful disruption of the oil-rich region and the spread of cheap oil, has had a tangible impact on the energy security landscape in the region. The effectiveness of this strategy led to a significant boost in the USA's economic power, leading to the US dominance of the region. The energy sector in the USA has then used this victory to take various actions including investments in manufacturing, exports, and infrastructure development.
