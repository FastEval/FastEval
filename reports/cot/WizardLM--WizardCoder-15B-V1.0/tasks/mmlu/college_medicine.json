            "question": "A police officer carries out hundreds of traffic stops every year. When his supervisor is reviewing the officer\u2019s records for the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of various genders, ages, and races. However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child. What psychological framework would directly address the unconscious bias in his behavior? \n\n(A) Behaviorist\n(B) Psychoanalytic\n(C) Cognitive behavioral\n(D) Humanistic",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nAccording to the prompt, the officer specifically refers to middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes when discussing how he is more likely to write tickets for them. This is a pretty obvious sign of a psychological bias that we humans have and cannot avoid. \r\n\r\nTo explain this behavior, we can look at the context in which the officer had this specific set of traits. He is a police officer today who carries out hundreds of traffic stops every year, and has had some amazing time doing so. However, before his current work, he had a serious family break up with his father, who was a violent man who often sexually abused his victims. Hence, it is very likely that he would have been a burden on his family during his childhood, especially with the ongoing sex abuse.\r\n\r\nNow, let's say that the officer had an abusive relationship with his father. This could be for any reason though, such as jealousy, greed, or worse, hatred. While there may be some evidence to suggest that his father had sexual misconduct of some sort, it is unclear how widespread this practice was. It is also unclear how this relationship played a role in the behavioral traits that the officer has shown. \r\n\r\nBased on this evidence, it is quite possible that his behavior has become influenced by this relationship, and that it has become associated with his dark-vision and dark-hair traits. This is the unconscious bias that the officer has, and it may be that the underlying psychological factors are not immediately apparent to those outside of the officer's head.\r\n\r\nThis behavior can still be interpreted as preference, but it is also consistent with the notion that we have a deep-seated need to create positive social outcomes for ourselves and others. It is also clear that we do not have a complete understanding of the different psychological factors at play, nor the full context in which the officer had his current set of traits. Hence, it is difficult to directly address the unconscious bias through any specific framework.",

The olfactory bulb is a small, transparent membrane that filters out odors. Odorants are tiny molecules released by a variety of plants, animals, or microbes. The olfactory bulb processes these odorants and produces a many-layered, complex chemical architecture in the retina that is continuously updated and adapts to the immediate surroundings. The olfactory system involves structures in primates, such as the nasal cavity, olfactory tract, paranasal sinuses, and mammary glands. These structures connect to the central nervous system through the brain. The olfactory system, like other chemical-based sensory systems, relies on the availability of olfactory input to trigger behavioral responses. The chemical nature of the olfactory system makes it ideal for recognizing and processing small, minute, and ubiquitous odorants, such as herbs, insects, and natural products.",

When the adrenal gland is stimulated during high intensity exercise, it produces more phosphocreatine than it needs and it is transported to the muscles, causing them to become weak and unresponsive. \r\n\r\n- This leads to muscle wasting, tissue destruction, and eventually cell death triggered by apoptosis. \r\n\r\n- On top of this, high intensity exercise can also induce microvascular dysfunction that can lead to vascular injury and even disability. \r\n\r\n- After prolonged high intensity exercise, the body's ability to synthesize phosphocreatine decreases significantly, which can cause the symptoms of phosphocreatine withdrawal symptoms such as pain, stiffness, and pyrexia.\r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\n\r\n(C) about 1 minute.",

            "question": "A race car attempting to jump a series of 8 buses is set up on a flat track with a ramp at the end. Engineers assigned to the project have determined that, in order to jump the buses, the car must reach a velocity of 130 km/h. If the distance of the track is 50m, at what rate must the car accelerate to reach this velocity?\n\n(A) 13 m/s^2\n(B) 26 m/s^2\n(C) 7 m/s^2\n(D) 17 m/s^2",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning: \n\nThe given problem statement requires us to calculate the acceleration rate, or deceleration rate, needed for the race car to reach a certain velocity. Since the car must decelerate to 130 km/h, we can start by calculating the initial speed of the car, which is based on the given condition that it must reach a velocity of 130 km/h.\n\nIf the car is travelling at the given initial speed (which is 0 m/s initially), it will have to decelerate over time until it reaches a point where its speed is equal to 130 km/h. We can use the formula V=IVt to calculate the velocity at any given time t in the future. Using the given initial speed of 0 m/s, we can substitute it into the equation to get:\n\n0 = 130 / (1/t + 1/2)\n\nSimplifying and rearranging, we get:\n\nt = (2/130)*ln(0.5)\n\nSo, the time taken for the car to decelerate to 130 km/h is about 1.5 seconds. This means that the initial acceleration rate, or deceleration rate, initially needed is:\n\na(0) = r(0,1)/t(0,1) = 0\n\nwhere t(0,1) is the time taken for the car to reach 130 km/h from rest.\n\nIn other words, the car is not moving yet. Therefore, its acceleration rate a(0) is 0. Its initial speed is 0 km/h and its initial distance is 0 m. \n\nNow, we can calculate the distance travelled by the car over this initial time period. This distance will be the distance that the car has moved at the beginning of the deceleration phase. Since the car must take 1.5 seconds for it to reach 130 km/h, the distance travelled by the car over this time period is:\n\n1.5 * (2/130)*ln(0.5) = 0.48m\n\nNow, we can integrate this distance to find the total distance travelled over the entire deceleration phase. This distance will be the distance that the car has travelled during the initial deceleration phase. Integrating the distance travelled over the time period, we get:\n\nd = 0.48m + 0r(0,1)t + C(0,1)\n\nWe can substitute the values of r(0,1) and C(0,1) from the previous equation to get:\n\nd = 1.5 * (2/130)*ln(0.5) + 0(-40m/s)*(2/130)*ln(0.5) + C(0,1)\n\nC(0,1) can be represented as a constant, so we can ignore it. Therefore:\n\nd = 1.5 * (2/130)*ln(0.5) - 20m\n\nIf the distance is 50m, then the time taken for the car to travel this distance will be:\n\nt = d / (130/3.6) = 0.48s\n\nTherefore, the car will have travelled a total distance of 48 m, which is less than the given distance requirement of 50 m. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B, which indicates that the acceleration rate needed to decelerate from rest to 130 km/h would be 26 m/s^2.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\n\nA) Fatty acid can bind to the thiokinase protein in several ways. Thiokinase catalyzes the cleavage of the covalent linkage between a thioester and a donor group in a fatty acid moiety to give rise to the furthest possible soluble alcohol derivatization. Thus, a co-enzyme with thiokinase activity and acetyl-CoA are the two transported by Fatty acids into the mitochondrial membrane bound to thiokinase.\n\nB) Coenzyme A represents about 10% of the mass of covalently bonded CoA. In anaerobic conditions or when oxygen is limiting, some of the CoA is directly translocated to the mitochondria. However, coenzyme A is added in sizes of approximately 1-1000 fold by bacteria during fermentation to improve the efficiency of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which reduces excessive back-diffusion of ATP. Therefore, Fatty acids containing CoA are transported by them into the mitochondrial membrane.\n\nC) CoA and acetyl-CoA are the only two fatty acid families that are also known to have a transporter in the mitochondrial membrane bound to them. The main transport of CoA by acetyl-CoA is non-competitive inhibition by Mn2+ and/or Fe2+ ions. Therefore, CoA and acetyl-CoA extruded by the glycolytic pathway are transported into the mitochondrial membrane by acetyl-CoA.\n\nD) Carnitine has a five-conformer allosteric network in the mitochondrial membrane that allows the transport of many different fatty acids. In general, carnitine transports CoA, acetyl-CoA, and fatty acids that are derived from the anabolism of prostaglandins, like myristic acid, palmitic acid, and oleic acid. Therefore, Carnitine is transported into the mitochondrial membrane by CoA, acetyl-CoA, and fatty acids that are derived from the anabolism of Prostanoids.\n\nTherefore, answer is (B) Coenzyme A (CoA) is the transported into the mitochondrial membrane by fatty acids containing CoA.",

            "question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, which of the following statements is the author likely to agree with?\n\n(A) Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use.\n(B) Patients on a diet would benefit from sauna use.\n(C) Salt restriction would be equal to sauna use for hypertensive patients.\n(D) Patients with skin conditions may be cured with sauna use.",
