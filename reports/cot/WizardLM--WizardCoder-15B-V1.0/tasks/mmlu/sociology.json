            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n1. The content of the media is determined by market forces:\r\nThis is incorrect. Media content is a community-driven process, but not fully determined by market forces. Instead, media content cultivates public opinion and provides a platform for new ideas and perspectives, while also serving as the vehicle for market forces.\r\n\r\n2. The subordinate classes are dominated by the ideology of the ruling class:\r\nThis is incorrect. The ideology of the ruling class is never fully dominated by the subordinate classes. Instead, the subordinate classes have selective access to media content that they deem important and to the political space they are part of.\r\n\r\n3. The media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers:\r\nThis is incorrect. Media manipulation is often derived from making claims about identities, ideologies, or behavioral patterns of the media's users. It is not always the case that the masses are treated unfairly or as susceptible to manipulation. Rather, media actors often optimize their campaigns to reach a specific demographic or audience.\r\n\r\n4. Audiences make selective interpretations of media messages:\r\nThis is incorrect. Audiences are generally overly critical of media messages, as they are never fully informed on the political issues, values, or beliefs being expressed. Instead, audiences make judgments based on the appeal and credibility of the message, as well as the emotions it generates.\r\n\r\nBased on the reasoning above, the correct answer is D. D) audiences make selective interpretations of media messages.",

            "question": "The ecological approach to urban sociology involved studying:\n\n(A) how social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources\n(B) the forms of wildlife and natural habitats that could be found on the edges of the city\n(C) the way in which people organized collective protests about environmental issues\n(D) how men and women used the city's public spaces differently",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, let us break down each option to identify the components:\r\n\r\nA: How social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources\r\n\r\nThis option includes ecological and spatial factors such as:\r\n\r\n- demographics and density of populations\r\n- distribution of resources such as land, water, and infrastructure\r\n- proximity to Transportation and communication networks\r\n\r\nThe specific actions taken by social groups such as colonization, competition, and governance can moderate these factors.\r\n\r\nB: The forms of wildlife and natural habitats that could be found on the edges of the city\r\n\r\nThis option involves ecological factors such as:\r\n\r\n- existence and abundance of plants, animals, and soil types\r\n- interactions between plants and animals, and between animals and humans\r\n- weather patterns, flooding, and erosion\r\n- natural disasters such as tsunamis, storm surges, and droughts\r\n\r\nC: The way in which people organized collective protests about environmental issues\r\n\r\nThis option involves various contexts such as:\r\n\r\n- political and cultural factors\r\n- identity and cultural appropriation\r\n- positionality and power of the groups\r\n- forms of participation and event management\r\n\r\nD: How men and women used the city's public spaces differently\r\n\r\nThis option involves how people engage with the spaces, such as:\r\n\r\n- social roles and cultural values\r\n- perceptions of privacy, security, and boundaries\r\n- use of language, signage, and forms of communication\r\n\r\nBased on these ecological factors, we can conclude that ecosystem and spatial factors play a crucial role in the development of urban sociology.",

            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n1. Cannabis use was increasing throughout all sections of youth in the 1970s: This statement seems to be correct as cannabis use is increasing in youths across the lifetime of the population.\r\n\r\n2. Learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career: In this instance, it seems likely that cannabis use was an acquired addictions in the 1970s.\r\n\r\n3. A dangerous pastime that young people should not be allowed to pursue: This claim seems to be untrue as cannabis use is widely accepted in all social settings, including young people's social lives.\r\n\r\n4. Not as enjoyable as other sociologists had suggested: This statement seems to be related to the sociology of cannabis use. It is not impossible to find examples of people who enjoy cannabis use, but such examples are hard to come by and could be due to factors outside of cannabis use.\r\n\r\nAnswer:B - Becker correctly identified the cannabis use statement as referring to cannabis research and use by the Elderberries in the 1970s. The Elderberries were a \"deviant career\" in that they were pursuing a \"dangerous pastime\", which was not as enjoyable. However, cannabis use in the 1970s was increasing for many youths across the population.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning step-by-step:\n\n(A) an urban set: This is a correct answer. Middle-class urban settlements were central to developing societies in the 19th century. Although all factors were contributing factors, some of the main ones  responsible for this development were the increased opportunities in urban areas, the increasing number of industries, and the participation of large populations in sustained voluntary activities.\n\n(B) too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness: This answer is not correct. Often, middle-class families were too small and isolated in urban life to even have a strongly developed sense of class-consciousness. However, over time, class consciousness, particularly in young adults, developed and was reassuring to many families.\n\n(C) often involved in 'white collar' work: This answer is also incorrect as many middle-class families did not have the luxury of easy access to the high-paying jobs and were often working in jobs that were not 'sexy'.\n\n(D) all of the above: This final answer seems to be a combination of the previous answers if not the same. Middle-class urban settlements in 19th century were highly developed and involved in many voluntary associations and civic bodies. However, they were often too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness and worked as 'white collar' workers. The key to their success and development was the opportunities they provided and the support of the dominant elites.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nA: Private information about consumers, such as user details, addresses, phone numbers, and bank account information, are important aspects of surveillance in the context of technological forms. They help governments to detect terrorist activities, trace criminal activity, or keep track of individuals in need of assistance. An increase in sophistication in this area helps to strengthen existing security measures. Despite the fact that these information are usually kept private, some of them can still be accessed by third parties if they are required to support terrorist activities.\r\n\r\nB: Electronic tagging systems help to track individuals moving around the world. They can be used to identify terrorists and the individuals they are targeting. They are based on technology that enables location-based access control and monitoring of people's movements. The use of electronic tagging systems can reduce the probability of prisons being overcrowded and improve the overall security of societies. \r\n\r\nC: Employees' activities at work are monitored by technological forms of surveillance. They are used to detect and prevent unauthorized use of company resources and detect potential threats. They can also help to prevent cyber attacks and other types of attacks on the company's information and networks.\r\n\r\nD: By combining these three factors, technological forms of surveillance have made it easier to access, exchange, and monitor 'private' information about consumers. The use of electronic tagging systems can also help to reduce prison overcrowding by reducing the number of densely packed cells and the need of frequent prisoner transfers. Employees' activities at work are being monitored to detect and prevent unauthorized use of company resources and to detect potential threats. Overall, all of these factors help to improve the overall security of societies.\r\n\r\nAnswer: (A)",

This meant that owners were still able to exercise control over the management of their businesses and were able to share their ownership and profit on equal footing.\n\n(B) Profit and ownership were becoming increasingly separate functions, as businesses were increasingly thought of as property-owned, but not necessarily run by the owners. In addition, several industries were maturing as a model of societal ownership, where shared ownership is now possible.\n\n(C) Scientific management techniques were considered ineffective and bureaucratic due to the fact that managers were often not given the freedom to take risks, interact with employees, and utilize information more efficiently than owners. \n\n(D) Managers were becoming dissatisfied with their working conditions and planning to take over the businesses of their owners.

            "question": "Marxist feminists explain patriarchy in terms of:\n\n(A) a lack of equal rights and opportunities for men and women\n(B) sex classes, through which men oppress women economically, politically and sexually\n(C) women's domestic labour being exploited by the capitalist economy\n(D) the dual systems of capitalism and male domination",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nMarxist feminists often postulated that patriarchy is a paternalistic system that restricts and even derails women's rights and opportunities through capitalist exploitation and exclusion. Patriarchy, as Marxist feminists argue, reflects the root of positive hegemonic values such as patriarchy, heirarchy, and monopoly.\r\n\r\nOne of Marxist's most famous theories is that the entire system of property was devised and designed to impose an oppressive power on women through the exploitation of men. Women were the objects of capitalist exploitation, which was perceived as contributing to exploitation of the child and woman.\r\n\r\nIndeed, feminism advocated for women's rights and autonomy, which expressed oppression and exploitation of the patrician/mother class. Marx argued that patriarchy based on the beneficent and equal distribution of property was an anachronism that was not compatible with feminist values. Therefore, patriarchal systems did not foster feminist experimentation.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, Marxist feminists argued that patriarchy, as a system that imposes fetishization on women through patrearchal institutions, had shrunk the women's role and growth in society. The system excluded women from all institutions of power, especially those carried by the capitalist economy.\r\n\r\nInstead, feminist institutions were promoted that encouraged women's participation in political and social activities and the production of scientific, cultural, and artistic works, making them empowered to shape their own futures. This empowerment, Marx argued, was necessary for the formation of a truly feminist society.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seems that Marxist feminists argued for the necessity of a complete change in the patriarchal system that served the capitalist dilemma of oppressing women and had no feminist root. Their arguments focused on feminism's empowerment, rather than patriarchy, which would have been an institution of oppression and exploitation. They proposed an alternative system and institutions that encouraged women's experimentation, thus advancing feminism's cause.",
