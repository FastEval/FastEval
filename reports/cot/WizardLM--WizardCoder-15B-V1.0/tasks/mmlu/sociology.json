            "model_answer": "Based on mass-society theory, we can infer that:\r\n\r\n- (A) Media is determined by market forces. One possible explanation is that the mass media are engaging in private information dissemination which could affect the market competition.\r\n- (B) The subordinate classes are dominated by the ideology of the ruling classes. This argument could be supported because the mass media dominate the political discourse by manipulating the masses as vulnerable, passive consumers.\r\n- (C) The mass media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers. This argument is supported by the idea that in order for the mass media to succeed, it has to develop a distinct, proprietary niche. The niche marketers would be the ones able to manipulate the masses into buying those products that are most profitable for mass consumption.\r\n- (D) Audiences make selective interpretations of media messages. This is because mass audiences tend to be drawn from a wide range of cultures and prior social experiences, making it difficult for certain messages to reach those who are experiencing it for the first time. Besides, selective interpretations of media messages could also occur due to biases or opinions that the mass media has about certain groups of people.\r\n\r\nAnswer: (B)",

            "question": "The ecological approach to urban sociology involved studying:\n\n(A) how social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources\n(B) the forms of wildlife and natural habitats that could be found on the edges of the city\n(C) the way in which people organized collective protests about environmental issues\n(D) how men and women used the city's public spaces differently",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Define ecological and urban sociology: As a field, urban sociology is generally considered to be not only focused on the members of a city but also on the surrounding environment. Ecological theory is a branch of biology that studies the environment and how it affects organisms. Therefore, a field of ecology can be an important component to urban sociology.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Choose between ecological approach and urban sociology approach: Since ecological theory should be considered alongside urban sociology, the ecological approach to urban sociology should be chosen as the more comprehensive and comprehensive theory of both urban politics and society.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Define concept of colonization: Colonization is the process whereby a new group of people invades and occupies an area. It is essential to understand colonization as a key concept for understanding the formation of urbanization in the world.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Explain how areas are colonized by social groups: Social groups that colonize an area differ in their objectives, methods of colonization, and intended outcomes. Some groups of people colonize areas to gather resources or to influence power structures. Other groups seek to create a sense of belonging by creating new forms of culture or new attitudes about the natural environment.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Explain the ways in which wildlife and natural habitats are found on the edges of the city: The ways in which wildlife and natural habitats are found on the edges of the city are largely influenced by the presence of people and the geographically esoteric nature of the area.\r\n\r\nStep 6: Explain how people organized collective protests: People organized collective protests about environmental issues in different ways. Some protestants called for a complete overhaul of the city's environmental infrastructure, while others focused on individual concerns such as overuse of land for parks and gardens.\r\n\r\nStep 7: Explain how men and women used the city's public spaces differently: Men and women used the city's public spaces differently because they had different roles and responsibilities in society. For men, the public space was more meaningful because it was a place where people could gather and socialize, while for women, the public space provided a place to explore and pursue their interests.\r\n\r\nOverall, the ecological approach to urban sociology involves studying how social groups colonize different areas of the city and competed for resources, as well as the forms of wildlife and natural habitats that could be found on the edges of the city. Urban politics also involves the way in which men and women used the city's public spaces differently and the social institutions that organized collective protests about environmental issues. Although the ecological approach to urban sociology is not as well developed in the academic sphere, it offers a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of how social and political actors interact with the natural environment.",

            "question": "Becker proclaimed that cannabis use was:\n\n(A) increasing throughout all sections of youth in the 1970s\n(B) learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career\n(C) a dangerous pastime that young people should not be allowed to pursue\n(D) not as enjoyable as other sociologists had suggested",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "1. Cannabis use increasing throughout all sections of youth in the 1970s.\r\n\r\nFirst, Becker points out that cannabis use has increased significantly during the 1970s. He then says it is increasing throughout all age groups, including youth. This means that cannabis use is increasing even in the children of youth who do not have the legal age to consume it. Therefore, the assumption that cannabis is just for young people is incorrect.\r\n\r\n2. Cannabis use not enjoyable.\r\n\r\nCannabis use has been widely criticized but it is essential for many people to consume cannabis in various forms. It is essential for medical, psychological, spiritual, and mental health benefits. Furthermore, cannabis use is becoming increasingly popular in countries around the world as the street culture and tourism has grown. The argument that cannabis use is not enjoyable is incorrect because it is essential for users to enjoy cannabis.\r\n\r\n3. Cannabis use learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career.\r\n\r\nThe assumption that cannabis use is learned through a deviant career is incorrect. Canabis use is one of the most popular forms of drug use among youths as it is associated with a variety of social activities and interests. It is widely documented that cannabis individuals are in a mismatch with the society around them. On the other hand, older cannabis users are also more engaged in cannabis use in various social contexts.\r\n\r\n4. Cannabis use is dangerous for young people.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Becker denies that cannabis use is dangerous for young people. He continues to argue that it is dangerous because it can lead to alcohol dependence, anxiety, depression, and other psychological issues. However, there are many health benefits to cannabis use, including a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease, reducing stress, improving mood, and better sleep. Becker's points about cannabis use being associated with decreased risk factors for mental health issues are important but they are not inherently dangerous. For example, cannabis use can be used as a relaxing substitute for alcohol or other drugs, but it can also encourage fads and unnecessary drug use. Overall, the assertion that cannabis use is dangerous is limited by the definition of dangerous used in other contexts.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: An urban set and a voluntary association\r\n\r\nMiddle classes were centers of civic and voluntary associations involved in political organizing and economic activity. These sets functioned as community centers, bringing together a group of people to discuss issues such as social and economic problems, policy issues and the role of political power. They were also home to a variety of arts and cultural events that attended by the elite. During the nineteenth century, urban settlements across the United States held social and political power.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness\r\n\r\nMiddle classes were brought together in a diversity of cultures and customs, making it difficult for them to have a strong sense of class consciousness and to identify with their opinion on important issues such as education, healthcare, welfare and political power. Middle classes were also rejected by society's views and policies, and often used violence to claim their own authority and power.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Involving 'white collar' work\r\n\r\nDuring the nineteenth century, most middle classes were involved in white collar work, performing manual labor, working in factories, and working in the railroad system. This caused them to feel isolated and helpless, especially in the face of the developing world.\r\n\r\nStep 4: All of the above\r\n\r\nThe reasoning for this answer is that middle classes functioned as centers of civic, voluntary, and white collar activity, as well as a source of diversity and oppression. Connecting these different elements together caused their members to be too complex and too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness and to identify with their views on social and political issues. By rejecting their oppressive culture, they attempted to dominate society and become the dominant group, causing most nation-states to collapse overnight.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nThe concept of gemeinschaft or community is based on the Treaties of Corinth (1062) and their predecessors. Corinth was a great metropolis, but people were divided into tribes and divisions. Each tribe and division had a leadership and ruled by their rulers. These were organized into governments and armies. However, Corinth was divided into many small tribes that had little or no contact with each other. This created a system of tribal solidarity, but also limited the opportunities for social gatherings or organizing collective efforts.\r\n\r\nSoon after, Corinth passed the Spring League Union Act (SLUA), which legally recognized several tribes as a unified whole called the Spring League or Grand Union. The SLUA broke the old division of Corinth into a unified community of 500,000 people. The Spring League had a charter that all trades and professions should be supported and shared equally by the members. The community consisted of members from all over the world, and they were free to move around within its borders. The SLUA also mandated that all the trade unions, guilds, trusts, and other organizations working in the city were also united under one governing body.\r\n\r\nLater, the Vienna Convention signed into law in 1848, which recognized Corinth as the metropolis of Europe. The Convention renamed it Vienna and called it the Vienna State. This unified state had mechanisms in place to regulate trade and commerce, and organize political organizations working in its territories. However, the Convention did not provide citizens with much incentive to organize into unions or coalitions.\r\n\r\nIn the 19th century, organic solidarity, or the desire to form a strong and unified community, became increasingly promoted in Europe. These ideas began taking hold in different ways, including the emergence of social movements such as demonstrations and protests, the rise of new political movements such as the Bildungsroman and socialism, and the founding of gemeinschaft48 groups in different cities. These groups aim to create a sense of solidarity between communities and to strengthen their political power.\r\n\r\nIn the 21st century, T\u00f6nnies was the first to emphasize the importance of organizing into coalitions to provide mutual support to various issues. In the 1980s, he was riding on the Organizing for Development (ODI) movement, which promoted ideas of organizing in solidarity to address world problems. He founded the Gemeinschaftsverbund (GV), an organization composed of like-minded individuals that aim to address the causes of poverty and inequality. By the turn of the century, the GV had expanded its membership and operations to include various sectors such as healthcare, housing, education, and media.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the concept of gemeinschaft developed by Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies describes basically the same relational characteristics as organic, mechanical, and hierarchical solidarity. Additionally, the word \"gemeinschaft\" is German for \"solidarity\". Therefore, the correct answer is (C) gesellschaft.",

            "question": "There was a growth in income inequality in the 1980s because:\n\n(A) rates of income tax increased equally for all occupational groups\n(B) there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them\n(C) the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings\n(D) growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n(A) Increase in tax rates equaled because there are more people in poverty as a result of economic recession. As a result, it is expected that higher income tax rates will be imposed on all those in poverty, including the employed. This leads to a flat income for those earning more, allowing for better uplift of economic opportunity in both the sub-prime and mainstream sectors. \r\n\r\n(B) This is a classic trade-off between the need for skilled workers and the limited supply of workers, which results in the creation of a shortage of jobs. Professional jobs, which demand more training and expertise, are likely to increase in the areas of finance, legal, accounting, and management while requiring skilled workers. This means the need for more skilled workers may cause the shortage of mainstream jobs. \r\n\r\n(C) This is another reason for the income inequality, with increased prices of consumer goods in turn leading to a larger increase in earnings, which in turn leads to an increase in inequality. As consumers become more dependent on the goods and services they purchase, they tend to increase their consumption which, in turn, increases their income. As a result, the welfare benefits that help provide economic opportunity should be discouraged, leading to an inequality in incomes. \r\n\r\n(D) Unemployment has been the most prevalent reason for income inequality, particularly in the United States, where it has been rising significantly over the last decade. The low wages and lack of skilled workers generally result in high unemployment rates, which may instead be used as a way to distribute the income of the wealthy. This leads to an increase in tax revenue for those in poverty, which results in a trade-off between better uplift of economic opportunity and inequality. \r\n\r\nSo the answer to the question is: D, which is because of the increase in unemployment and the increase in the welfare benefits, leading to a trade-off between better economic opportunity and inequality in incomes.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:Based on the definition of patriarchy given by the feminist Marxists, it can be argued that A is the correct answer.\r\n\r\nExplanation:The term \"patriarchy\" refers to the various roles, responsibilities, and authority an individual has in the family. The definition by the feminists provides a clear distinction between the formal and informal care of a mother in a family. However, their definition does not mention the role of patriarchy in the family structure. \r\n\r\nAccording to the feminists, patriarchy is characterized by a lack of equal rights and opportunities for men and women. This refers to the fact that the spouse is considered to be the head of the family, with equal opportunity to pursue education and other professional careers for its children as well as her to inherit the family estate. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are other factors which further reinforce the division between formal and informal care of the mother. These include the limits imposed on women by patriarchal role models who cannot afford to cover the basic needs of the family. Patriarchal role models also may not have the administrative or financial authority required to manage a complex family or to retain their household's custody.\r\n\r\nAnother issue to consider regarding patriarchy is the alleged association between men and women exploiting women's domestic labour. This refers to the situation where men are exploited while maintaining a low level of ideological allegiance. The feminist Marxists assert that the situation is different from patriarchy in this aspect, as their definition does not include any form of exploitation.\r\n\r\nThe feminism may also be mistaken into suggesting that patriarchy is a form of gender roles or a structural aspect of the family that occurs due to its historical and political connections. However, as the definition does not mention any such role, it is clear that it is understandable that the term does not refer specifically to this aspect of the family. Therefore, it falls back to the question of the lack of equal rights and opportunities for men and women, which can be equated to a lack of achievements and opportunities for women in the family structure. \r\n\r\nHence, the correct answer to the question is (A) a lack of equal rights and opportunities for men and women.",
