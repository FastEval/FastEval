            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n- After the Industrial Revolution, financial freedom was lost to exploited labor and bureaucracy, especially in wealthier nations. \r\n- The governments of these nations had failed to provide basic services such as currency, transportation infrastructure and banking services. \r\n- The lack of these services hindered modernization and the development of advanced industries, leading to a deep depression and the consequences of the 19th century for weaker societies.\r\n\r\nAnswer:As per the above reasoning, the main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically is the lack of a currency. This is because without a currency, governments cannot measure the value of goods, and the economy cannot determine how much to import and export.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nThis question tests the reader's understanding of the meaning of zero population growth, rapid growth rate, and homeostatic plateau. Zero population growth is a term used in population ecology to describe the state of a population where the population remains constant for a long time and continues to increase without any significant increase in birthrate or deathrate. Rapid growth rate is another term used in population ecology to describe the state of a population where the population continues to grow at a high rate, even after enough resources are available to sustain the population. Similarly, homeostatic plateau is a state where the population remains constant throughout time and mimics the natural long-term equilibrium state.\r\n\r\nBased on the given options, demographic momentum refers to the tendency for a population to increase in size over time. However, it is worth noting that introgression and genetic drift can also result in a population with demographic momentum. In conclusion, the answer to the question is D, demographic momentum.\r\n\r\nAnswer:D",

            "question": "The tendency for migration to decrease with distance is called\n\n(A) push factors.\n(B) pull factors.\n(C) distance decay.\n(D) migration selectivity.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:The tendency for migration to decrease with distance can be analyzed in terms of two forces \u2013 the pull and push factors. The pull factor is influenced by the proximity of neighboring populations, while the push factor is driven by population dynamics within each habitat. In a steady state, populations lose some of their area due to dispersal and migration, thereby reducing the amount of habitat available for future colonization. To counter this loss, the habitat needs to be increased at some level to support survival of the colonized individuals and other colonists. This leads to the conclusion that the distance decay of migrants is the dominant contributor to this tendency.\r\n\r\nAnswer:D",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Assuming we are given a binary classification of (TRUE/FALSE) for the given question, we can see that (C) is the correct choice as it expresses what the question asks for. The percentage of women in the total labor force declined is a fact in our society worldwide and it is true that there is a significant reduction in the percentage of women in the labor force. Many factors may influence this such as improved sanitation, increased access to higher paying jobs, improved healthcare and education. Gender equality in the workforce is a major issue and lead to an overall decrease in the salaries of women compared to men. However, the percentage of economically active women in the labor force is not affected. In addition, agriculture is one of the most profitable fields in the labor force but is not the sole source of employment of women. Therefore, it would not be meaningful to say that the percentage of women working in agriculture is higher than the percentage of men working in agriculture. Additionally, the fact that women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia is not always true, as there may be many other factors influencing this such as family responsibilities or workplace culture. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning: \n\n1. safety: Can be considered as a social factor, instead of a geographic factor. However, since migration has always been a crucial factor in terms of well being, it is always better to migrate from countries with a high safety index.\n\n2. better climate: Similar to safety index, the climate factor plays a crucial role in migration. The climate of a country plays a fundamental role in the development of people, and such a climate is often more prone to change.\n\n3. better schools: Another crucial factor for migration is the availability of good education. Schools being located in high-income areas, families may be able to attain better education.\n\n4. overcrowding: As a result of migration, overcrowding of the country is a potential factor. However, the local government can take steps to reduce overcrowding by providing transportation options, increasing access to healthcare, and other initiatives efficiently distribute the population.\n\nAnswer: \n\nDefinitely D is not a pull factor of migration.",

United Kingdom is not a well-known example of a relict boundary because none of its territories have a distinct boundary as relict. Germany has had relict boundaries, but none in a well-known public or private space. Bolivia is not a well-known example of a relict boundary because it has not had any relict boundaries as of yet.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "A centrifugal force in a country is a result of a combination of the forces of earth's rotation and those of the sun and planets. It causes the earth to spiral outward against the gravity of the sun and other planets. These forces are responsible for the rotation of the earth around the sun and planets and thus are regarded as contributing towards the formation of the earth's magnetic field.\r\n\r\nReasoning:\r\nC - An attack on the country's territory is a logical explanation for the formation of a centrifugal force. Until such an event, the planetary motion due to sun's and planet's influence is balanced by the earth's own centripetal force. Since an attack is initiated by an external entity, the centrifugal force due to rotation and centripetal force due to gravity will be weakened and instead come into play in the form of a centrifugal force.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n1. Mediterranean climate: Because this region is on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, which is hot and dry, this may be best attributed to the Mediterranean climate.\r\n\r\n2. Limited forest cover: This region is located on a coastline, which is dense with forests, meaning there may be little natural vegetation for plants to grow. This may be best explained by the limited forest cover in this region, which results in fish populations being concentrated in areas covered by tall trees.\r\n\r\n3. Growth of manufacturing: This may be a factor, since the region is part of a global economy, with manufacturing producing more goods and services. However, the continent-wide expansion of manufacturing, with agriculture being particularly important, may result in the population density of this region increasing, probably due to the urbanization of the region.\r\n\r\n4. Access to trade routes: This may be a factor, since this region is often located near the ports and marketplaces of other countries, which allows for the movement of goods and services. However, this region may have had mediocre luck in trading with other countries in the past, due to poor conditions during wars and conflicts.\r\n\r\nAnswer:C (B is incorrect, because it's not limited by forest cover).",
