Marginal cost is the increase in cost that occurs when a one-unit increase in the item sold occurs.\r\n\r\nMarginal cost = $20 - $25 = -$5\r\n\r\n3. Since marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost, the point of minimum distance between revenue and cost is at total revenue = total cost.\r\n\r\nTotal revenue = $100, Total cost = $100\r\n\r\n4.

Otherwise, even if the marginal revenue curve intersects the marginal cost curve, the last condition (equilibrium being unstable) would still hold. \r\n\r\n2. The supply curve and the demand curve are two separate elements. They show how much a supplier is willing to provide and how much a customer is willing to pay for, respectively. Therefore, if the two curves intersect, it means that there is a common factor for both parties, which indicates that the two equilibria are in tension.\r\n\r\n3. The marginal revenue curve and the marginal cost curve represent two separate curves, one for the revenue side and one for the cost side, respectively. These curves represent the profit the seller can earn by increasing the quantity of good sold and the cost the buyer needs to pay for that good, respectively. If there is no intersection, there is no common factor that is causing the two equilibria to be distorted.\r\n\r\n4. To break down the unstable equilibrium, both parties would need to switch strategies. Without the incentive to deviate, they would end up choosing the same strategy and thus having no incentive to deviate.

This practice often results in output prices rising above their competitors' prices, which can harm consumers and the economy. To counteract this threat, the government often punishes collusion by setting strict price controls, resulting in output levels that are typically below their competitors'. This results in a decrease in consumer surplus, but also a boost in economic activity and improved efficiency.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nWe need to determine whether the demand is perfectly horizontal, highly inelastic or highly elastic. \r\n\r\nPerfectly horizontal means that the quantity demanded is uniform across all the prices. If the quantity demanded is not uniform and is more in a certain area of the market, then we need to separate the demand curve into two discontinuous segments. The market segment where the quantity demanded is highly inelastic is where the price decreases but the price is not increasing, resulting in a sharp cut-off point at the minimum price.\r\n\r\nHighly inelastic demand curve means that the demand curve is well-behaved and does not curve significantly and yet tends to be very flat, and the slope of the curve is high at the minimum price, decreasing more gradually as the price increases. This is a demand curve where the firm does not have the incentive to increase its price as long as the quantity remains constant.\r\n\r\nHighly elastic demand curve means that the demand curve is also well-behaved, but the slope of the curve is much lower than in the case of a perfectly horizontal curve, resulting in a more gradual decline in the quantity demanded as the market price increases. In such a case, the firm has an incentive to increase its price as long as the quantity remains constant, which signals a strong price discrimination effect.\r\n\r\nWe see that the demand curve A clearly shows a perfectly horizontal demand curve. The reason for this is that the quantity demanded is constant across all the prices, resulting in a straight line that does not curve much.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer should be (A), which demonstrates a perfectly horizontal demand curve.",

Elastic demand is a means to increase demand by creating new products or services that can be sold quickly or adapt as technology and demand change. Elastic demand also helps to avoid lock-in because it allows customers to easily switch to different products or services without affecting their financial situation. The relationship between all these factors is that the increasing complexity of the technology industry requires innovators to use these tools to remain relevant and competitive. \r\n\r\nAnswer:C.

An army-figures industry that uses a small fraction of the plastic demanded for all purposes is likely an increasing-cost industry.\r\n\r\nThe industry that makes plastic army figures uses a small fraction of the plastic demanded for all purposes. This means that the plastic used to make the figures is not cost-prohibitive compared to overall plastic demand of the industry. An army-figures industry that uses a small fraction of the plastic demanded for all purposes is likely a constant-cost industry.\r\n\r\nThe industry that makes plastic army figures uses a small fraction of the plastic demanded for all purposes. This means that the amount of plastic used to make the figures is much less than overall plastic demand of the industry. An army-figures industry that uses a small fraction of the plastic demanded for all purposes is likely a decreasing-cost industry.\r\n\r\nThe industry that makes plastic army figures uses a small fraction of the plastic demanded for all purposes.

An army-figures industry that uses a small fraction of the plastic demanded for all purposes is likely a profit-making industry.\r\n\r\nBased on this reasoning, the best option for the army-figures industry to be is A.

Furthermore, profits are being generated from producing army-figures, which is a positive sentence. It is important to note that army-figures can still be a profitable industry even though it uses a small fraction of the overall plastic demand, but in general it is an increasing-cost industry.",
