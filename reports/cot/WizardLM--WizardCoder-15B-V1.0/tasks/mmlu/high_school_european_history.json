Matter is a kind of organic substance that forms living organisms.\n2. No living organism is formed without the presence of carbon dioxide.\n3. Carbon has two components: carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen.\n4. Carbon is necessary for the formation of living cells, which are responsible for carrying out all of life's functions.\n\nHence the author proposes that \"life\" is a result of the interaction between CO2 and other chemical substances, just as electronic devices are only possible thanks to the interaction of light, magnetic fields, and other electrically charged particles. In this view, \"life\" is a supernatural phenomenon that could not have occurred without the presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.",

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.",

Instead, he loves splendor and magnificence, and encourages similar tastes in his court. He values the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, which he contributes to preserve. However, his bias against the king is due to the fact that he did not remove their power, but rather reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.

The latter would imply that Florence has a large wealth of individuals closely linked and sharing a cultural and economic inheritance from their families in the middle ages. The size and possessions of the estates would also reflect their importance to the city's culture and to the realm of artisanal trade. In addition, the number of gold coins and other wealth-carrying items would be indicative of the importance of the city's financial infrastructure, and the wealth of noblemen would suggest the importance of a well-established and prosperous city economy.

When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.
