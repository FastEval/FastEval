            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) because the United Nations Security Council has 5 permanent members and 10 rotating members, all with veto power. \r\n\r\nA different answer could be (C) because 10 permanent members with veto power and 5 rotating members without veto power could also be considered as a veto-supported council. However, the question asks specifically for the veto power structure of the council, so (B) or (D) would be more appropriate.",

            "question": "Why did Franklin D. Roosevelt initially favour an 'isolationist' stance on the part of the US during the 1930s?\n\n(A) He believed that internal reform rather than international negotiation was the key to economic regeneration of the US\n(B) He believed that German domination of Europe would be in US interests\n(C) He always favoured isolationism\n(D) All of the above",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To correctly answer this question, we need to start by understanding the stance of Franklin D. Roosevelt initially favouring. He was an economist and he believed that successful economic reform would be aided by a strong cultural renaissance and integration. To achieve this, he pursued policies such as encouraging the \"use of Western medicine,\" open borders, and protecting research and development to further development.\n\nAt the same time, he also wanted to maintain the strategic isolation of the US in Europe to keep the US \"a true democracy.\" According to Roosevelt, this stance was a conscious decision that he did not make lightly.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt's initial stance on the issue of isolationism makes sense. In isolationism, states are forbidden from relying on each other, and instead are reinforced by a network of alliances. This means that Roosevelt believed that apart from a nation of great power, the US would benefit from a strong cultural revolution. Despite these dreams, however, Roosevelt realized that his isolationism was becoming more internalized, and the US was becoming increasingly threatened by powers other than Germany in Europe.\n\nTo address this issue, Roosevelt expanded his involvement with international negotiations, such as the Hague Conference, and explicitly called for \"right of self-determination\" for all Western nations. With these efforts, Roosevelt hoped to regain some of his original isolationism and start to see the Bolshevik Revolution as a true threat to US democracy. Despite the challenges, Roosevelt still believed that a strong cultural renaissance and USA government would help to reinvigorate the US economy.\n\nTherefore, to close, the answer to the question should be B (because he believed that successful economic reform would be aided by a strong cultural renaissance and integration, which would require strong alliances, and that a strong cultural revolution would help to reinvigorate the US economy, which requires a true democratic foundation, while maintaining strong alliances).",

It is characterized by a degree of political activism, emphasis on liberal politics, and a new focus on global values. With its distinctive focus on global and multilateral governance and the introduction of stricter immigration controls, New Populism has become a popular alternative to neo-liberal or neo-conservative movements that sometimes seek to challenge neoliberal governance and policies.
