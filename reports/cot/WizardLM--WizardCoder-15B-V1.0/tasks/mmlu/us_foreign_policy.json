            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nClarifying the question, we have to decide which of the given alternatives has the correct structure for the United Nations Security Council. And the correct structure means, in the given setting, the permanent members (members from the peak of power) in any given period cannot be replaced without the approval of the Council and the power of the veto. On the other hand, the rotating members (members who occupy lower ranked positions) can be replaced without any disapproval. Moreover, the total number of members in the Security Council (permanent and rotating) is 15.\r\n\r\nSo based on the given facts, the alternative B or D is the answer. As both of them have the same number of permanent members (5), the first option of having 10 rotating members with no veto power is a viable option. The permanent members in any given period (6-10) are not affected by any replacement, while the rotating members (1-5) can be replaced without any disapproval. Also, the total number of members in the Security Council (permanent and rotating) is 15.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer for the given question is Option B or D (B).",

It set a precedent for the US to mobilize behind its diplomatic clout and select a number of key negotiations and alliances, including Vietnam-US cooperation. This move helped to accelerate the signing of the Vietnam Emergency Powers Act in 1965, leading to a productive truce. In turn, it helped to secure the preparations for the 1967 invasion of Vietnam and led to the development of the new U.S.-led truce and the establishment of the Peacekeeping Operations Command. This marked the end of a cooperative and peaceful effort to defeat the Japanese invasion of Vietnam.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "A) The first American president to visit communist China was Richard Nixon. \n\nReasoning: Richard Nixon was of the Brown family and was born in Dublin in 1920. During World War I, while Nixon was serving in Guadalajara (where the Communists were already in power), he received the general election. However, he was unable to go to the election because he was already in government. Nixon became the first President of North America to visit the Communist countries because he realized that the conflict between Communism and Capitalism was being infiltrated and he needed to do something to end it and restore the order of things. Nixon was able to successfully lead a militant campaign of separatist struggle and overthrow the Communist governments in the southern United States. He was able to reach out to China, which was the last refuge of Communism and freedoms, and end the Communist domination. Nixon was a visionary leader who was able to form a powerful alliance with the Chinese Communist Party to overthrow the Southern Communist governments and restore national sovereignty. Nixon was the victim of the Communist Party not only for his actions against Beijing and Tiananmen, but also for his political beliefs that caused Communist control over the country. Had Nixon not intervened in the Communist controversies and returned home to support the country, he may have been the first American president to visit a Communist country today.",

            "model_answer": "In the context of this question, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was created by the United States to pledge its support for ending the use of conventional weapons in Europe and for ending the support of the Soviet Union in the field of nuclear weapons. It was signed by President Barack Obama on May 2, 1982 and ratified by both the U.S. and the European Union. The treaty was intended to safeguard the existence of nuclear weapons in the future by penalizing and disarming Soviet nuclear forces, disallowing the deployment of nuclear weapons to any civilian targets, and excluding the U.S. from making direct nuclear weapons tests.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was never signed by the Senate, which was tasked with overseeing the content of the treaty. Instead, it was ordered to be rejected in 1985 and canceled in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe US and the EU both opposed the creation of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, as it was seen as a step backwards in securing nuclear proliferation. The US argued that the treaty would harm the military and national security of the US, especially as it signed the treaty without considering the country\u2019s nuclear capabilities. The EU argued that the treaty did not address several long-range nuclear missiles that were used to support conventional arms, which had many large-scale deployments worldwide and contributed to the destruction of homeland and hospitality.\r\n\r\nOverall, the answer to the question is D.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\nA: The Cold War ended the 'American exceptionalism' movement entirely. \r\n- Despite various efforts from American politicians to revive the movement, its impact was felt to be minimal and only involved a limited amount of discontent.\r\n- Cold War conflict ensuing political strife made it clear that America's approach to world and US values was no longer the driving force behind expected national development. \r\n- America's emphasis on military might and often joined wars with weaker countries to strengthen its dominance. \r\n- As a result, it was difficult for Americans to understand how to build upon its culture of excellence. \r\nB: As a result of this, American exceptionalism was also enhanced.\r\n- The benefits of exceptionalism were being seen in the US, such as enhanced economic growth, improved healthcare, job creation, and political power. \r\n- With the increased power that America had over its allies, the government also had the opportunity to push for reform and improvement across the US. \r\n- In the process, exceptionalism also triumphed over traditional patriotism, encouraging leaders to adopt optimistic attitudes towards developing nations.\r\nC: The extension of American power globally challenged assumptions of exceptionalism.\r\n- Although the Cold War had knocked out traditional American institutions of legitimacy, it did not end the US as the 'leader of the free world'. \r\n- This meant that the ratio of economic power to military might increased, leading to increased military spending and role in wars with defenders. \r\n- In the same vein, the government also had to consider additional challenges, such as recession, the rise of crime and terrorism, and the accelerating political polarization. \r\n- As a result, the assumption of exceptionalism had to be challenged and core values of US culture and way of thinking were rehabilitated. \r\n- This reflected a long-term change in US politics, once again giving Americans a greater voice.\r\nD: Both options A and B are correct. If American exceptionalism fully disappeared, this implied that in general, American values were becoming increasingly less personal and universal. Although value systems might change, the 'exceptional' mindset that the US have embraced over decades still had an impact on the policymaking process in the 21st century.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the reason(s)\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt initially had a political bias against external intervention and focused on internal transformation of the US. The reason may be attributed to his experience as a radical socialist who fought for an independent andAUTHORITARIAN France and Germany in the Second World War. It is likely that Franklin initially wanted to isolate the US from the other powers in Europe, and this drive was reflected in his personal philosophy.\n\nStep 2: Discuss the relevance to the present-day context\n\nEven if we do not agree with the stance of Franklin D. Roosevelt, our understanding of the economic crisis in the US and the differing political perspectives of the two main powers competing for dominance in Europe have both influenced our stance on the relative importance of isolationism in US foreign policy. The US's ambition was to win the war against Germany without becoming a global power and it did so through economic reform. While the German war of independence had only made the choice of a no doubt about the future once again, there were still significant differences in US strategy and mentality. Without a strong military presence, it was difficult for the US to gain real control over Europe and its economic engines. Internal reform rather than global negotiation was key to transforming the US economy in the context of a Bretton Woods approach.\n\nIt is likely that all of the above reasons were played into Roosevelt's decision to favour an 'isolationist' stance, but we can understand his later shift to a more radical posture in favour of 'national liberation' and the superiority of a strong military force to the states.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n1. The United States government had long been a power player in World War I, so it was natural that it would be privileged to use all available resources and subordinate economic power to its advantage. However, until the early 1940s, it was already commonly recognized that economic policies were predicated on an understanding of the conflict. Thus, the government would take several steps to shift economic power from Europe to the United States.\r\n\r\n2. The first significant shift in power was in Europe itself. In 1914, the Prime Minister of the German Empire explained to his British counterparts the importance of defeating Russia in the First World War. As a result, the German government sent a sum of 50 million German soldiers to hunt and ambush Russian soldiers. These soldiers were unprepared and would be killed by their own armies if they traveled through Russia. The German Empire would have to rely on its own resources to fight Russian aggression.\r\n\r\n3. From an economic perspective, the United States could not handle being subordinated to an all-powerful nation but also had to contend with domestic crises emerging from increased wage losses. Before World War I, most economists assumed that professionalism and stability in the industry were key to a smooth economic recovery. However, in the aftermath of the war, industrialization as a whole swiftly collapsed and workers suffered. Full employment crisis, famine, and disease epidemics ensued.\r\n\r\n4. The US government quickly went to war with Britain and expanded its influence in Europe. France, Germany, and Italy lined up to attack the US army. The troops were initially superior to the US but were taken by the following year's parade by a renegade Italian fleet. By the late 1920s, the US army was broken up into smaller units, each hired from the states that it needed to defend.\r\n\r\n5. The US had a deep understanding of the economic conflict and its importance in the conflict between the West and the East. It expected to benefit economically from the war and maintain its position in the regional economic order. Thus, the US government prioritized economic policy over war policy.\r\n\r\n6. Under this approach, the US government focused on shifting economic power from Europe to the rest of the world, but only after careful consideration of the demands and logistics of rapid industrialization. This included shifting the burden of traditional wage labor to higher-paid jobs that competed with the factory workers with higher fancy salaries.\r\n\r\n7. From 1940 to 1945, the US government used its economic resources to improve communication and military power in the region. It significantly trained its troops and provided the necessary resources to create a military readiness of the country's industrial armies.\r\n\r\n8. During the war, the US expanded its military presence in North Africa and Central Asia. By the end of the war, the US had aggressively defended Middle East and Europe against Soviet expansion.\r\n\r\n9. The war also widened the path of industry in Western countries. The US expanded its economic influence in Africa and Asia, opening markets in these regions that had been previously closed due to imperial controls.\r\n\r\n10. By the end of World War I, the US had expanded its borders and territories, relieved some economic pressures, fueled the recovery from inflation in the US, and had made substantial progress in restoring economic stability.\r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\n\r\nThe final line should contain the answer as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else.\r\n\r\n(D)",

Often, the Congress acts as a coordinating body that directs the military to withdraw from any declared conflict, unless they agree to join.
