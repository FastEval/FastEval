            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "This question tests the candidate's understanding of the difference between bargaining, satisficing, accepting, and compromising. A bargaining offer is a way for a negotiator to offer something in return for a promise or suffer loss in return for gain. If the other party agrees to the offer, the bargaining is deemed successful. Satisficing, on the other hand, is a way for a negotiator to accept a lesser desirable situation in exchange for a higher value. Satisficing is desirable in situations where the best outcome cannot be achieved by negotiation. Accepting is the act of accepting the best option presented, regardless of whether it is the most desirable. Compromising, on the other hand, is accepting a less desirable outcome and affirming the need for a higher value to be offered in return. Finally, the candidate needs to choose the correct answer from the given options and explain their reasoning process. Based on the given options, the correct answer is (D) Compromising.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The term for the 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision-making can be described as heuristics. \r\n\r\nReasoning: \r\n- Heuristics refer to instinctive judgments that humans use to guide their decisions. \r\n- These judgments are based on previous experience, current context, and some unconscious cognitive processes. \r\n- The term heuristics is derived from the Latin phrase 'heuristicus', which means 'ingenious plan or device.' \r\n- Therefore, heuristics are 'rules of thumb' that humans use to make decisions, and they are not necessarily accurate in all situations. \r\n- The term 'rule of thumb' is not specific enough to describe the type of bias, as there are many types of biases involved in decision-making.\r\n- However, the heuristic approach is generally applied to a wide range of decision-making problems, making it a good starting point for understanding bias. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the term for the 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision-making can be described as heuristics.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is D. \n\nNormative perspective refers to an approach that assumes that some standard is taught or decreed by a higher power. This perspective is common in western culture, where people tend to see authority as a god-given power. However, normative perspectives can also be used in other cultures and contexts, such as those in Asia or Africa, where there is dispute over what should be done, or not done. \n\nIn the case of the present question, it is suggested that a person is in a normative perspective, because the way things were is assumed by the person asking the question, which is not recognized as the correct answer. Therefore, answer D is more appropriate. Answer A and B could also be possible depending on the context and specific issue at hand.

            "question": "In the 'five forces model', what is the type of competitive activity that exists between organisations?\n\n(A) The potential for entry into the industry\n(B) The threat of substitute products\n(C) The power of customers\n(D) The level of rivalry",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "We can start by exploring the differences between 'entry into the industry' and 'substitute products' competitive activities. Entry into the industry means that one organization hopes to become a dominant player in the company. Subtitute products mean that the company, or another entity, is attempting to take over the market. Companies are faced with a choice between staying poised and attracting potential customers and attempting to dominate the industry by developing and producing substitute products.\n\nNext, customers are a crucial factor in competition. Customers are a crucial driver of competition. They are responsible for setting the price of a product or service, and they are often the first to decide whether to purchase a company's product. Once a customer purchases a product, they are likely to become increasingly dependent on the company and will either switch to another company or purchase a rebate or discount.\n\nThe 'power of customers' competitive activity is a type of competition that exists in most sectors. Companies compete for customers' attention, revenue, and the ability to retain customers. This competition is based on the belief that a company has a strong dominant position in its market and will sell their product to the customers it deems most important. This is a powerful competitive challenge for companies, but not all companies are competitors in the eyes of potential customers.\n\nFinally, 'rivalry' is a competitive activity that often exists between companies. Rivalry is a type of competition that companies face in the industrial, economic, and political marketplaces. Companies, by definition, are rivals to one another. They compete for the resources and opportunities to extract value from their markets. Rivalry can often be a major driver of competition and exacerbate circumstances for small, less-developed companies, but it is also a risk for larger companies that have the scale and resources to compete for larger marketshares.\n\nIn conclusion, the competitive activity that exists between organisations is based on the differences between 'entry into the industry' and 'substitute products' competitive activities, customers' ability to retain them, and their own power to compete for value. The rivalry of companies is also a key factor in competition.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Thatcher cannot be termed a transformational leader because she was the third former leader of a post-Communist Yugoslavian state that remained in power after apartheid took hold. The other political leaders listed can be classified as transformational leaders because they were born to an oppositional economic system and transformed it into a political power. Gorbachov, for example, adopted a liberal economic policy that encouraged the free trade and export of goods and services, resulting in enormous economic growth. He also was a manifest leader and a key figure in the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Mandela, on the other hand, was the first person to critically examine the systemic corruption and inefficiency in the global political order and to initiate a revolutionary change that would transform the world. Finally, Clinton, a former president who emerged from exile in Vietnam, faced nationalism challenges and political extremism due to economic hardship, and she led the country to a moral victory by implementing foreign aid programs. Therefore, none of the political leaders listed can be called transformational leaders.\n\nAnswer:A",

The Gantt chart provides a visual understanding of the project's schedule, as tasks are grouped and labeled within specific time intervals.\r\n\r\nAnswer:D) Work output design. This is a visual representation of the work being done in a project, and the Gantt chart provides a stronger level of detail, as it shows the actual completion dates as well as the estimated start and end dates.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "A) Workers enjoy responsibility. \r\n\r\nExplanation: By definition, McGregor's Theory X involves a theory of work. According to the theory, work involves the flow of human tendencies, including the physical and mental effort required to accomplish a task, and the social role that these efforts play in shaping not only the work itself but also the industry that the person works in. These tendencies and roles are what make workers responsible for their actions, and this need for responsibility plays an important role in the management of an organization\u2019s resources, as well as in being a positive force for motivation, engagement, and innovation.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "This question tests understanding of the meaning of the term \"power\" derived from status or position in an organisation. Here's the reasoning:\r\n\r\n1. A: \"status or position in an organisation\" usually refers to someone's authority and power. Therefore, if someone holds a \"status\" or \"position\" in an organisation, they may have a \"power\" derived from that status or position. For example, a \"leader\" may have an implicit power of leadership, whereas a \"member\" may have a power of decision making or participation in the work.\r\n\r\n2. B: An \"expert\" may be someone who is knowledgeable and experienced in a particular area or subject. However, this could also refer to someone who is an authority figure within the organisation, such as an executive or a chief financial officer. Experts can be held accountable for decisions made by non-experts, and a lack of expertise can also be viewed as a demerit or lack of ability.\r\n\r\n3. C: \"Reward\" usually refers to money or some other form of compensation for achieving success. In an organisational context, someone holding \"reward\" may be someone who is given promotions or professional recognition for their achievements, or may be given an opportunity to move up the ranks.\r\n\r\n4. D: \"Legitimate\" seems like a pretty clear term, but it may be further clarified with the context of the word. Is \"legitimate\" referring to someone who is given an authority figure within an organisation? Or is it referring to someone who has been granted special powers or privileges in an organisation? For example, companies may have a \"diversity and inclusion\" policy that make it legitimate for certain employees to have more privileges than others.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Legitimate.",
