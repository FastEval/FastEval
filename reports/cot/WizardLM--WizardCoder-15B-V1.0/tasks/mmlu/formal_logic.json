In predicate logic, we can represent this as:\r\n\r\nTxy(X, Y)\r\n\r\nThis means that the course, X, is taught in the classroom, Y, and we can write the following in English:\r\n\r\nThere exists at least one course, X, that is taught in a particular classroom, Y, and at least one classroom, Y, in which someone teaches a particular course, X.\r\n\r\nIn predicate logic, this is equivalent to the statement:\r\n\r\n\u2200xy \u2208 C \u2203z \u2208 C [(Tz(y, x) \u2227 Tz(z, y)) \u2192 (X = z)]\r\n\r\nwhere C is the set of all possible courses and classrooms. \r\n\r\nWe can replace the statements to be true or false as follows:\r\n\r\n\u2200xy \u2208 C \u2203z \u2208 C [(Tz(c, d) \u2227 Tz(d, c)) \u2192 (d = z)]\r\n= True, because all course d is taught in classroom c and everybody teaches every course twice, once in the teacher's classroom and once in the classroom of the student taught.
