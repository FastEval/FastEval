            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n1. We need to estimate the cost of one ticket. Therefore, we divide the total cost of four tickets by 4. \r\n\r\n2. We need to write the equation in a form such that we can substitute t into the left-side of the equation. Therefore, it is more convenient to work with the right-side of the equation. \r\n\r\n3. We have two unknowns, t and 4, so we need to introduce them explicitly into the equation.\r\n\r\n4. We can't divide the total cost of four tickets by the same quantity twice, so we must use a new variable. \r\n\r\n5. By simplifying the equation, we can isolate t, the variable we introduced to simplify the equation. \r\n\r\n6. We need to find the cost of one ticket so we can substitute it into the previous equation. \r\n\r\n7. We can use the following form for the equation: $$112 = 4t$$ \r\n\r\n8. We know that $t$ is the cost of one ticket. Therefore, we can replace $t$ with $1$, the cost of one ticket, to simplify the equation: $$1 = 4 \\text{ or } 4k$$, where $k$ is any constant. \r\n\r\n9. We use the fact that the total cost is split evenly between four tickets to eliminate $t$ and $4$ from the equation. Therefore, we have the following form for the equation: $$1 = 4k$$ \r\n\r\n10. We see that $k$ can only have two possible values: $1$ and $2$. \r\n\r\n11. Therefore, we need to find the cost of one ticket when $k=1$ and when $k=2$. \r\n\r\n12. We can observe that the total cost of four tickets is greater than the cost of one ticket when $k=2$, so we know that the cost of one ticket must be greater than $2$ times the cost of one ticket. \r\n\r\n13. Therefore, when $k=1$, the cost of one ticket must be less than $2$ times the cost of one ticket and when $k=2$, the cost of one ticket must be greater than $2$ times the cost of one ticket. \r\n\r\n14. When $k=1$, the cost of one ticket is: $$1 < 2t$$ \r\n\r\n15. We can substitute $t$ with $1$ to solve the equation: $$1 < 2$$ \r\n\r\n16. Therefore, when $k=1$, the cost of one ticket is $1$. \r\n\r\n17. We can observe that when $k=2$, the cost of one ticket is greater than twice the cost of one ticket. \r\n\r\n18. Therefore, when $k=2$, the cost of one ticket can be any value greater than $1$ and is: $$t > 2$$ \r\n\r\n19. We can substitute $t$ with any value greater than $1$ to solve the equation: $$t > 2$$ \r\n\r\n20. Therefore, when $k=2$, the cost of one ticket is greater than $2$ times the cost of one ticket. \r\n\r\n21. Therefore, the correct form of the equation is: $$k = 2$$, and the solution is: \r\n\r\n$$t = \\frac{1}{2}$$ \r\n\r\nTherefore, the cost of one ticket is $\\frac{1}{2}$, an estimate of $9.6$ cents. \r\n\r\nAnswer:$(B)$, $t=\\frac{1}{2}$,  $\\frac{4}{2}=2$",
