            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\n24 can be separated into 2 and 22. By the division-with-remainder property, we know for any integers a and b that a = bq + r with q an integer and r = 0, we have the following:\n\n24 = 2 x 22 + 0 => 2 = 0 + 24 % 2 => 2 = 24 % 2\n\nSo 24 % 2 is divisible by 2, which means we can express 24 as 2 x some integer. Since 2 factorizes into 2 and 1, we know that 24 can be expressed as the product of two odd prime numbers, namely 2 and 3:\n\n24 = 2 x 3\n\nTherefore, the value of p in 24 = 2p is 2.",

This means that we have to apply the same sign to both the numerator and denominator. Since the denominator is positive, we are left with a positive number on top of the fraction. We cannot use negative signs in the numerator because we are giving an answer with a denominator of negative.

To solve for the cost of one ticket t, we can divide $112 by four to get $28. Therefore, the equation is 4t = 28.\r\n\r\n**Option B** The second option states that the total cost for four tickets is $112. To find the cost of one ticket t, we need to multiply $28 by four to get $112. Therefore, the equation is 4t = 112.\r\n\r\n**Option C** The third option states that the total cost for four tickets is $112. To find the cost of one ticket t, we can divide $112 by whatever value t is now. Since t is divided by 4, we can simplify the equation by setting the left side to $0$ and the right side to $112$. Therefore, the equation is 0 = 112.\r\n\r\n**Option D** The fourth option states that the total cost for four tickets is $112.

            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\nWe need to write 1 and 1 over 11 in simplest form.\r\n\r\nA: The simplest form of a mixed number is to write the numerator first and then the denominator in a fraction. Therefore, we can write 1 over 11 as 1/11. Therefore, 1.1 over 11 would be written as follows:\r\n\r\n1.1 = 1/11 x 11\r\n\r\nSimplifying:\r\n\r\n1/11 = 1/11 x 11\r\n\r\nSince both sides are equal, we can write:\r\n\r\n(1/11 x 11) = 1/11 x 11\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, 1.1 over 11 can be written as 1/11.\r\n\r\nB: Writing 1 over 11 directly without any division by 11 isn't a valid mixed number format.\r\n\r\nC: Adding 1 to the numerator doesn't change the whole number value of the mixed number. Therefore, we can write 12 over 11 in the same simple format as previous answers.\r\n\r\nD: Subtracting 1 from the numerator and adding 1 to the denominator would also result in a new value for the whole number.
