            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nThere are multiple ways to approach this question. One way is to compare the pressure and temperature of each component at the equilibrium point. If all three components are at equilibrium pressure and temperature, then they will all have the same pressure and temperature. By definition, pressure of each component is constant at equilibrium. By definition, temperature of each component is also constant at equilibrium. Therefore, if the pressure and temperature of component A, B, and C are the same, it means the pressure and temperature of component B and C are the same, and the same goes for A and B.\r\n\r\nUsing the above logic, we can see that there are only five ways in which the components can be at equilibrium:\r\n\r\n1. A = 1, B = 2, C = 0.5\r\n2. A = 2, B = 1, C = 0.5\r\n3. A = 1, B = 0.5, C = 2\r\n4. A = 0.5, B = 1, C = 2\r\n5. A = 0.5, B = 2, C = 1\r\n\r\nEach of these five equilibria is a line, and there are only two lines that leave all three components at the same equilibrium pressure and temperature: the x- and y-axes.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To find the correct answer, we will need to know a few things about nitronyl nitroxides. \r\n\r\nNitronyl nitroxides are stable radicals that contain two nitrogen atoms (niobium NII), and they are made of a chemical equation NII + X = NNNO[X]. \r\n\r\nX can be various isotopes of oxygen, which means there are multiple nitrogen nuclei (NII, NIII, NIV) as well as a number of oxygen nuclei ranging from deuterium to tritium (OII, OIII, OIV, etc.). \r\n\r\nTo derive the EPR spectrum of a solution of a rigid nitronyl nitroxide diradical (ND), we first need to make the following substitutions:\r\n\r\n- NNN + OOO[X] \u2192 NNNO[X]\r\n- NNN \u2192 NIT\r\n\r\nThis means that the ND is an isomer of a nitronyl nitrile, which has a molecular formula of NIT + OOO[X]. \r\n\r\nThe most abundant isotopes of oxygen in a solution of ND are deuterium, i.e., ODD (d). Therefore, the unpaired electron in the ND's EPR spectrum is coupled to two deuterium nuclei (NNN and OOO). Because the ND is not a mirror interactant, we can safely ignore any magnetic interaction between NIT and OOO. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to the rigid ND, the solution of a spherical ND (SN) with J << a (0 \u2264 J \u2264 0.05) deviates from a very standard nitronyl nitroxide diradical. The SN's EPR spectrum contains both JJ and \u0394J states. However, as there is only one nitrogen nucleus in the SN, the coupling of the unpaired electron comes from two equivalent nitrogen nuclei (NII and OII). Therefore, the most probable number of lines in the SN's EPR spectrum is 2. \r\n\r\nFinally, we can see that the ND and SN both have a coupling of two nitrogen nuclei, but the number of lines in their respective EPR spectra is different. The ND contains two lines (NNN and ODD), while the SN contains only one (NII and OII). Therefore, the answer is (C) 5 lines for the ND while (D) 7 lines for the SN.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the radiation therapy of cancer. Radiation therapy involves administering radiation to treat cancer. When cancer cells are damaged by radiation, they undergo differentiation to become tumors or cancer cells. Cancer cells are a kind of cell made up of DNA and proteins. Cancer cells can make up a large proportion of cancer patients and can be harmful to the body. \r\n\r\nIn the case of cancer treatment, radiation therapy involves using radiation, specifically infrared (IR) and visible light, to target cancer cells and distrupt their growth.

Oxidizing Element: This factor is required for both ferromagnetism and paramagnetism. In both cases, oxidation of the metal occurs to increase its tensile strength and turn it into a ferromagnetic or paramagnatic material. \n\n2. Spin Configuration: The spin configuration of the electrons is crucial for ferromagnetism and paramagnetism. If the electrons have a low spin configuration, they occupy lower energy states and behave like an insulator. In paramagnetism, these electrons are independent of the magnetic field. \n\n3. Magnetic Properties: Metals with high magnetic properties are more susceptible to magnetism. This can be attributed to their distinct magnetic moments and magnetic spin dipole moments that result from the presence of magnetic moments in the valence electrons. \n\n4. Valence Electrons and their Bond Order: If metallic atoms have an unpaired electron (i.e., they have zero or one electron that is not bonded to an atom), then they become imbalanced and may behave like paramagnetic or ferromagnetic. In paramagnetism, these electrons are independent of the magnetic field and may freely move around on the metal. In ferromagnetism, these electrons repel each other and tend to align on the metallic surface, with a small tetrahedral or octahedral arrangement of the electrons. \n\nTherefore, in order for both paramagnetism and ferromagnetism to occur, all these factors are required.

            "model_answer": "Reasoning step-by-step:\r\n\r\nA) T1, unlike T2, is sensitive to very low-frequency molecular motions.\r\n\r\nThis is a false statement. T1 is not necessarily shorter than T2. The difference between T1 and T2 can be due to the three-way nature of DNA. In DNA double helix structure, two strands form a hairpin shape with a T and two complementary T. The two complementary Ts are donor and acceptor sites for the binding of nucleotides. The sidechain of the nucleotide is the T1 and there is a longer T2 in the opposite side. These two T2s are also responsible for breaking the double helix structure and forming four separate strands. Therefore, the T1 of the nucleus is not necessarily shorter than its T2.\r\n\r\nB) T2, unlike T1, is sensitive to very low-frequency molecular motions.\r\n\r\nThis is a false statement. Thompson's enzyme inhibits T2 in DNA by RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. Thompson's enzyme is a heterodimer of two subunits, each of which consists of a domain of variable length. One of the domains, called the Spines, interacts with nucleotides to phosphorylate them. The Spine domain of T2 consists of a substructure of four complementary regions: a short node head with three spine regions and a tail region. The four spine regions create many functional modules for the T2 receptors including the main C-terminal mRNA binding domain, spliceosomes, and transcription factors. The C-terminal mRNA binding domain and spliceosomes form two loops, each of which binds to specific spines of one strand of DNA. Splicesosomes, like other spine regions, interact with T2 to create DNA duplexes. However, the main C-terminal mRNA binding domain binds to the C-terminus of positive-strand DNA. It plays an essential role in DNA replication, reassembly, and repair. Therefore, it is the T2 of the nucleus that is directly involved in molecular interactions and processivity. As a result, it is the T2 that is typically inhibited by Thompson's enzyme.\r\n\r\nC) T1, unlike T2, is sensitive to molecular motions at the Larmor frequency.\r\n\r\nThis is a false statement. The Larmor frequency of a nucleus is a molecular rotational speed of one radian per second. Molecular rotation is a rotating center of an atom or molecule in nature that creates a torque that propels the atom or molecule. In T1, the torque is not directly caused by the molecular motion, but it is rather caused by the change in electrochemical potential. Consequently, the Larmor frequency of T1 is not directly linked to the molecular motion. Therefore, T1 and T2 are not necessarily sensitive to molecular motions at the Larmor frequency.\r\n\r\nD) T2, unlike T1, is sensitive to molecular motions at the Larmor frequency.\r\n\r\nThis is the correct answer. Thompson's enzyme inhibits T2, but this does not prevent T2 from creating structural DNA structures and maintaining their stability during nuclear DNA reorganization. The Lys-6 and Lys-9 nuclides are important for DNA replication and recombination. The Lys-6 nucleus binds Lys-6 nucleotides and initiates recombinases. The Lys-9 nucleus contains the mitochondrial DNA GTPase A2, which dephosphorylates the T2 and activates the cytoskeletal motors. By inhibiting the Lys-9 nucleus, T2 is specifically responsible for the DNA replication and reorganisation that maintains its stability in the nucleus. Consequently, T2 is the sensitive molecular motor during DNA replication and recombination. Therefore, T2 is responsible for many complex processes in the nucleus that are not directly related to the motions at the Larmor frequency.",
