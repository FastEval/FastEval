Disk seek time 25 msec\r\n2. Disk latency time 8 msec\r\n3. Disk transfer time 1 msec per 1,000 bytes\r\n4. Operating system overhead 1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 10 msec\r\n\r\nTo determine the exact time taken to read a large file called LargeFile.txt for the first time, we need to consider the time taken to perform the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Locating the file on the disk\r\n2. Reading the disk blocks containing the file data\r\n3. Modifying the retrieved blocks with the appropriate layout on disk\r\n4. Returning the modified blocks to the application\r\n\r\nSince we are not considering precise specifications for every aspect of the NoNicks system, we will assume that the file system behaves as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Disk seek time varies depending on how many sectors the file data spans across, but is generally on the order of 25 msec.\r\n2. Disk latency time varies depending on how much data was previously read from the disk, but is typically on the order of 8 msec.\r\n3. Disk transfer time is the amount of time required to transfer 1,000 bytes from the disk to memory. Since we are retrieving 4,000 bytes at once for version 2, the time required to transfer 4,000 bytes decreased by a factor of 2 for each 1,000 bytes that was previously retrieved. Therefore, each larger block of data requires half the time to transfer.\r\n4. Operating system overhead is the amount of time required to allocate and protect memory, perform CPU context switching, and handle other system tasks that do not directly relate to file I/O. The current estimate is 1 msec per 4,000 bytes transferred, plus 10 msec for other overhead.\r\n\r\nUsing this information, we can determine the time required to read a large file called \"LargeFile.txt\" under version 1 and version 2.\r\n\r\n1. For version 1:\r\n  a. Locate the file on the disk, which takes 25 msec in all cases.\r\n  b. Read the disk blocks containing the file data, which takes approximately 8 msec to 25 msec depending on the size of the file and the hardware disk controller.\r\n  c.

Return the modified blocks to the application, which takes 1 msec per 1,000 bytes returned.\r\n  e. The total time taken to read the file under version 1 is equal to the sum of these four components.\r\n\r\n2. For version 2:\r\n  a. Locate the file on the disk, which takes 25 msec in all cases.\r\n  b. Read the disk blocks containing the file data, which takes approximately 2 msec to 9 msec depending on the size of the file and the hardware disk controller.\r\n  c.
