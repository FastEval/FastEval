            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "C) It explains the nature of power-conferring rules. \n\nMore precisely, Hart argues that rules have two aspects: internal and external. The external aspect refers to the giving of permission and authority, and the internal aspect refers to the effect of the rule. In external law, a rule is enacted to give authority or permission. In internal law, the rule has an effect that influences the functioning of the society. By contrast, power-conferring rules always lead to a change in power levels within the governed body that exists under certain conditions. Power-conferring rules exert control over the agents under them and can have a huge impact on social structures and institutions. Therefore, power-conferring rules require the judgment of the affected parties to determine their guilt and liability. With this in mind, Hart argues that power-conferring rules demonstrate the requirement for careful decision-making and lawyerly skill.",

In what way?\n\n(A) It is misinterpreted as a prediction.\n(B) His concept of status is misrepresented.\n(C) It is taken literally.\n(D) His idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\nThe first misinterpretation of the statement is that it is a prediction, which goes against the grain of the statement. Instead, the aphorism is taken literally and describes the movement of progressive societies in a more traditional and legalistic manner. Indeed, the concept of status is not misrepresented in this sense, but rather the fact that the movement of progressive societies has been thoroughly analyzed and standardized by lawmakers, who have deemed it necessary to distinguish between a mildly political movement and a fiercely political one. To date, Western legal systems have not fully adopted this aphorism, but it can be argued that the progressive regime has not always been represented in the legal frameworks and institutions of today.\r\n\r\nAnswer:B",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer the question, we need to look at each criterion one by one. \r\n\r\nThe first criterion is that there is no distinction between the two forms of legal reasoning. This is not true. Judges have the power to interpret the law and act on it, regardless of whether they are acting in formal or grand style. Judges have the authority to make decisions and judgment that refute or support legal propositions, without necessarily receiving a formal education or education in legal reasoning.\r\n\r\nThe second criterion is that judges are appointed to interpret the law, not to make it. This criterion is false. Judges do not have the authority to make legal decisions or interpretations without the supervision of a lawyer or other expert.\r\n\r\nThe third criterion is that it is misleading to pigeon-hole judges in this way. False. Pigeon-holed judges have an inaccurate perception of the role of judges in legal proceedings. They do not have the authority to interpret the law and act on it, and their decisions can be biased.\r\n\r\nFinally, the fourth criterion is that judicial reasoning is always formal. This criterion is true. Judicial reasoning can be formal or informal. It is common for judges to interpret law using informal persuasion or analysis, or to give reasons and arguments without using word impairment or contradiction. However, judicial reasoning should always be subject to professional standards and professional judgment. \r\n\r\nBased on these criteria, the most compelling criticism is the one that suggests that there is no distinction between the two forms of legal reasoning. This criticism sounds like a personal misunderstanding of the nature of legal reasoning, rather than a good argument for either the grand or the formal style. Therefore, the answer to the question is B. The judges are appointed to interpret the law, not to make it, and judicial reasoning can be informal or formal, subject to professional standards and professional judgment, but there is no significant distinction between the two.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is not immediately apparent, so I will explain my reasoning step-by-step. \n\nFirst of all, there are different views on what the POP stand for, but I will refer to it as liberal democratic principles that enhance patient-centered care and provide fair and informed access to benefits for all. \n\nRawls goes on to say that the POP would use a \"compromise\" approach in selecting its political strategy, meaning not just to choose for themselves, but also to consider the needs of other stakeholders. They want to ensure that basic human concerns are addressed in the way that also serves their own highest interests.\n\nSecondly, the choice of wealth over compassionate society is not consistent with the POP's stated ethical principles. The second principle listed in the answer is equality over power. By this principle, individuals should have access to the same opportunities, resources, and benefits regardless of background or race. \n\nThird, the answer that the disabled should be protected is also not consistent with the POP's principles. This comes down to the \"fields of concern\" set out in the Declaration of Human Rights. States should ensure that disabled individuals have adequate access to benefits, jobs, safety, and protection in their struggle for equal rights. \n\nOverall, the most consistent answer is option A, which is consistent with the concept of wealth and compassionate society being a compromise. By using a compromise approach, the POP can ensure that their politics do not become contrary to the ethical principles set out in the Declaration of Human Rights.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, Weber's view of the 'England problem' is that that it is not an open issue but a dispute about the legal system of the English state.\r\n\r\nHe argues that the legal system of the English state in general has been criticized for being open to exploitation by a small elite group of aristocrats, and for enacting laws that fail to protect the interests and liberties of the majority population.\r\n\r\nHe then proposes that the solution to this problem would be to resolve the apparent conflict between two opposing legal systems that are based on a distinct set of principles that were developed over time. One would be the common law, which emphasizes individual rights and considers them as criminal offences that must be punished according to the severity of the crime. The other would be the civil law, which focuses on the rights and duties of civilians and relies on principles such as mutual help and negotiations to resolve disputes.\r\n\r\nHis third suggestion is to explain the difference between the common law and civil law by analyzing how they differ in the structure and organization of the legal system. They both entail the enforcement of laws and maintain order, but they differ in their level of abstraction, which means that civil law considers the relevant facts of a case at a higher level of abstraction than common law.\r\n\r\nFinally, he argues that the most important principle of capitalism is the legitimate domination of the consumer over the producer. It is the rule of law that states that all people, regardless of their position, are treated equally and according to their abilities. This principle is at the core of our country's legal system and is quite different from the common law or the legal system of other states.\r\n\r\nThus, Weber's answer is (C) By distinguishing certain features of the English legal system that facilitated the development of capitalism.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Cicero's conception of natural law is based on the idea that 'true law is right reason in agreement with Nature.' The reason why led to this conception is that, in his time, the Greek philosopher Platonic Philosopher Leonardo Da Vinci published his \"Elements\" on natural philosophy, which emphasized the importance of reason in the pursuit of truth. He further explained the importance of reason in the following principle: 'The study of the natural is the highest study, and it requires a good foundation in reason.'\n\nTherefore, Cicero's conception of natural law is based on the need for truth, which is a fundamental inquisitive activity of man. Reason is a key element in this understanding of philosophy, and it explains why he decided to study natural law in detail. \n\nIn consequence, natural law is not only based on the principles of gravity and friction, which can be tested experimentally, but it also has several other parameters that cannot be measured directly and need to be derived from observations of the natural world. Thus, the law of nature is the starting point for determining the truth of natural phenomena based on observations. \n\nAs a result, the principles of natural law are discoverable by reason, which allows man to draw conclusions from what is observed in the natural world without relying on clear and unambiguous instructions. Natural law also does not apply without good reason, because it is based on the principles of observation and inductive inference, which require clear reasoning and logical conclusions.\n\nIn sum, the key elements of Cicero's conception of natural law are truth, reason, and observation and inductive inference. Natural law does not apply without good reason and is the basis of all positive law, and hence is the newest fundamental of human reasoning.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, let's consider proposition A. This seems to suggest women can be rewarded by politicians for branding themselves as independent women. However, as MacKinnon notes, men dominate women and they control the pressures of politics. As such, proposition A does not seem to accurately reflect the situation. \r\n\r\nNext, let's consider proposition B. This implies that not only women are oppressed but also men as they are unable to pursue a sense of equal opportunity for women. This seems to be a reality, so it may be accurate if we assume women are inherently unequal due to their cultural backgrounds or geographical distributions. However, MacKinnon asserts that this would not necessarily mean women are unequal, so it does not justify the assumption that women are oppressed. \r\n\r\nProposition C is a bit agnostic, as it is not clear what the issue is. We can assume that redefinition of the 'woman' concept could be a possible solution if women were to be reoriented towards more equal roles in society. However, MacKinnon does not make it clear whether this is the end goal or if other measures are more practical. \r\n\r\nFinally, proposition D, while interesting, suggests that the world as we know it would be better off without women. However, MacKinnon does not provide evidence to support this proposition, instead stating that the world is not in a utopian ideal. As such, proposition D does not contribute to a clear argument and should be excluded. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the most inconsistent proposition with MacKinnon's argument would be proposition B, judging from the reasoning provided above. Proposition B is the one which suggests that men oppress women, which is inconsistent with men GOD and women are oppressed. Therefore, answer would be (B).",
