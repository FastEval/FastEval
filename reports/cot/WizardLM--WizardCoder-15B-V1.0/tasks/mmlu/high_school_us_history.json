In its magnificent domain of space and time, the nation of many nations is destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles; to establish on earth the noblest temple ever dedicated to the worship of the Most High\u2014the Sacred and the True.

O'Sullivan, \"The Great Nation of Futurity,\" 1839\nBy what means did the United States take possession of the Oregon Territory?\n\n(A) The United States was granted the territory in a postwar treaty with France.\n(B) The United States bought it from the Native Americans who lived there.\n(C) U.S. settlers were the first to arrive in the region; they claimed it for their country.\n(D) Great Britain ceded it to the United States as part of a negotiated treaty.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Solution: (C)\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n\"The Great Nation of Futurity\" is a phrase that was popularized by American historian John L. O'Sullivan. It describes the idealized picture of America in the future, where international peace will ensue and political unity will rule the world. O'Sullivan asserted that this vision of a nation of millions brought about by peaceful unity will eventually be realized in the way the United States achieved its colonization of the Oregon Territory.\r\n\r\nIn the 1880s, the U.S. and Canadian governments signed a treaty to purchase the territory. Although it is likely that this treaty failed miserably, it was an important step in the U.S. policy of expanding its borders.\r\n\r\nThe Native Americans who colonized Oregon were the first to arrive. In their attempts to become independent, they rejected the U.S. Confederate government that existed in Oregon in the 1840s, imprisoning them as \"slave bondsmen\" for many years. Despite these early efforts, the U.S. settlers refused to give up their claim until they reached a respectable level of wealth. At this point, they could afford to pay a high tariff and settle on undeveloped land.\r\n\r\nWhile the new settlers made great progress in building a new economy and advancing their literacy, they were confronted by American imperialism and exploited by the French and British governments. Together, they eventually became willfully violent and nationalistic. In 1887, they seized Control of Oregon from the British government and fought American military convoys entrapped in the Oregon Territory. After nearly two years of war, the U.S. suffered significant casualties, but their victory and their indignation eventually resulted in the collapse of the French and British governments, and the revival of American political unity.\r\n\r\nAfter the end of World War I and the end of the Cold War, the future of the United States had become a global superpower. While the United States had succeeded in its colonization of the Oregon Territory, it did not become the dominant nation in the Pacific. As a result, great parts of it are still managed by the colonial powers that were imperialistic and exploitative towards Native Americans.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBECAUSE no People can be truly happy, though under the greatest Enjoyment of Civil Liberties, if abridged of the Freedom of their Consciences, as to their Religious Profession and Worship: And Almighty God being the only Lord of Conscience, Father of Lights and Spirits; and the Author as well as Object of all divine Knowledge, Faith and Worship, who only doth enlighten the Minds, and persuade and convince the Understanding of People, I do hereby grant and declare, That no Person or Persons, inhabiting in this Province or Territories, who shall confess and acknowledge One almighty God, the Creator, Upholder and Ruler of the World; and profess him or themselves obliged to live quietly under the Civil Government, shall be in any Case molested or prejudiced, in his or their Person or Estate, because of his or their conscientious Persuasion or Practice, nor be compelled to frequent or maintain any religious Worship, Place or Ministry, contrary to his or their Mind.\u2026\n\u2014William Penn, Charter of Privileges Granted by William Penn,\nesq. to the Inhabitants of Pennsylvania and Territories, October 28, 1701\nBecause of Penn's Charter of Privileges, Pennsylvania became\n\n(A) one of the most religiously diverse colonies in British America.\n(B) one of the least religiously diverse colonies in America.\n(C) notorious for witch hunting and popular superstition.\n(D) known for its hostility to traditional religious practices.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nThe Charter of Privileges Granted to the Inhabitants of Pennsylvania and Territories by the late George William Penn, whose name and title have been greatly misapplied and misrepresented, are relevant to this question. Penn signed this Charter in October 1701, four years after Penn's election as mayor. The Charter protects the value of the natural resources and cultural heritage of the Commonwealth, and encourages industry, art, and commerce in a way that maintains the general welfare of the province. Its purpose is to encourage public opinion and discourage excessive religious policies. One of Penn's original motivations for granting this Charter was to increase public support for Penn's cause, but later he realized that it had negative effect on the religious tolerances of the inhabitants of Pennsylvania and those of neighboring colonies. Penn signed the Charter to \"encourage but not to deter\" the religious practices of the colonists.\r\n\r\nIn answer to your question, the relevance of Penn's Charter to the question is indicated by the fact that it prohibits any inhabitants of Pennsylvania or its territories from professing one almighty God, including following religious discussions or attending religious ceremonies, breaking faith, and engaging in any practices that would give rise to a later revival or expansion of religion. There are no specific laws prohibiting religious or other forms of worship, as long as they do not conflict with Penn's Charter. Penn's Charter only protects the monuments and natural resources that are a direct part of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe Charter of Privileges granted by Penn to Pennsylvania and its territories lays bare the tremendous turmoil that has lingered in this area over the years. It has resulted in hardships, injuries, and deaths, and it has exacerbated the existing longstanding troubles between faith and practice. Penn's Charter strengthens the influence of traditional religious institutions and practices by discouraging the creation and support of new ones. It stifles new ideas and forces the local population to practice what they are already comfortable with, even if it means risking their lives for their principles. The constantly changing spirit of the times has made religion a highly dynamic and evolving force, and it is responsible for a wide range of diverse religious beliefs and practices. Ultimately, the Charter of Privileges granted by Penn to Pennsylvania and its territories has led to an unprecedented decline in religion in general, even among some of the most hard-pressed communities.\r\n\r\nTherefore, while Penn's Charter is relevant to this question, the answer depends on the specific conclusion that you wish to draw. Can you identify a specific aspect of the Charter that prohibits a Person from living up to his or her consciences? If so, please clarify it. Do you wish to deny the validity of the Charter? Do you wish to allow the Charter to stand because it has been historically accurate on religious matters and has proven to be a useful asset in strengthening civic institutions?",

            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n- The Fourteenth Amendment has guaranteed equal protection for all citizens, including educators.\r\n- Separate educational facilities are unequal because they have different physical spaces, designs, and programming. While some students may be enrolled in one campus while others are enrolled in another, the public education system has failed to provide an equal education for all learners.\r\n- The complaint asserts that numerous voters disapprove of the segregation of schools and demand that public education respect the equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. This can be attributed to the practices of the plaintiffs and others similarly situated that seek to exploit the inequality between different schools and limit access to resources and opportunities for educators.\r\n- The conclusion that \"separate but equal\" educational facilities are inherently unequal because they have different physical spaces, designs, and programming is a circular argument. A system that promotes equal education cannot grant equal protection to all citizens because some learners may have special needs or restrictions that others do not have. Therefore, a separate but equal educational system is inherently unequal to the system that provides universal access to education for all citizens.\r\n- The plaintiffs and others similarly situated have an obligation under the Fourteenth Amendment to provide adequate access to education.

Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands.

            "model_answer": "The most closely related legislative act to nativism is probably the Espionage Act of 1917, especially since the Act primarily targeted Protestants who were ethnically motivated and involved themselves in espionage. The act imposed new penalties on Irishmen and others who were involved in crime by conducting espionage in foreign countries. The legislation also enacted a ban on discrimination against prominent Irishmen and women, drawing heavy criticism from white Americans due to its proximity to George Washington and the fight for suffrage. Additionally, the Act targeted certain foreign leaders and oppressed minorities in the United States. However, despite these issues, the legislation was frequently used to intimidate new immigrants and to silence certain opponents while allowing innocent citizens to pass as spies.\r\n\r\nAs for the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, the legislation passed in 1798 purportedly aimed at suppressing Irish and Scottish minority groups. The legislation banished new immigrants who were deemed undesirable by the British government and discriminated against minorities. The act also created a number of penalties such as losing civil service privileges, compulsory military service, limited immigration, and increased monetary losses for dissenters. Overall, the legislation was used extremely successfully to silence and discriminate against Irish and Scottish minorities in the United States.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n1. Corruption in government: This is a consequence of the larger social and economic crisis of the 19th century. During the Revolutionary War, oppressive governments sent a militaristic and nationalistic message to the people and led many to demand increased political power and control. However, after the Civil War, the Healthcare Act of 1865 and the programs of the federal government, led to a strong reform of the public sector and a significant increase in standards of living.\r\n\r\n2. A large-scale movement of struggling African American and white farmers, as well as urban factory workers: This can result from the movement of agricultural workers during the 19th century. The Agricultural Workers League in New York placed new restrictions on the movement of workers to economic regions of the South. This forced small farmers to move from their sown fields to factories or to use nurseries for delivery. This movement also led to the push of white workers into the southern industrial regions of the US and the rise of a white-collar class in higher wealth families.\r\n\r\n3. The two-party system of the era: This refers to the system of two major political parties, Democrats and Republicans, which were organized in Congress. The two opposing parties were expected to pursue different goals in power at a time when the nation was on the brink of revolution. In 1808, the Confederate party waged a contest with the Democratic middle class, who had won the nomination in December 1804.\r\n\r\n    However, the strike in November 1806, led to public outrage and a surge in voter discontent. Caused by the increased number of Democrats, the Army of the North supposedly declared war on the Confederate party and the parties were forced to renegotiate.\r\n\r\n    The suppression of organized protest, and the federal government's failure to intervene, led to the end of the Civil War and the rise of the two-party system.\r\n\r\n4. Continued skirmishes on the frontier in the 1890s with American Indians: This can be related to the fear and disappointment of federal officials that accompany American Indians during the 19th century and to their loss of jobs during the Great Depression. During the Depression, the U.S. internally displaced workers from their placements and created mass immigration policies that encouraged the emigration of American Indians to Europe. During the Great Depression, the United States used enormous force to disarm and obliterate American Indians and discouraged immigration into the US.",

He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves.

            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n(A) Firstly, president Lincoln's proclamation of the Emancipation Proclamation did not directly affect the course of the war. Rather, the war and its aftermath were already in full effect. The war as we know it was already in a state of hiatus, and the war effort was being focused on the Confederate claims to the lands. President Lincoln apparently had little interest in an immediate breakthrough, but rather was more concerned with ensuring that his successor was not held politically hostage for years by the Federal government.\r\n\r\n(B) On a different note, the fact that the war was being focused on the United States suggests that the war had fallen into an unusual state. President Lincoln's actions during the Civil War were thought to be directed toward realizing other objectives, such as the preservation of the American Commonwealth and the Union. However, his actions were in no way reflected in his proclamation.\r\n\r\n(C) The principal issue with the war being focused on the Confederate claims to lands is that the war effort was being dominated by the Confederacy. President Lincoln's shocking decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation appeared to imply that he was pursuing his objective of defeating the Confederacy and that the war effort was justified. In fact, the war was actually at an all-time high, with the U.S. gaining almost 400,000 veterans and opposing forces in the war.\r\n\r\n(D) The issue of the war not exclusively being focused on the preservation of the Union becomes even more apt when we consider the fact that President Lincoln issued the Proclamation with the purpose of encouraging trade with the Confederate states. Holding property in the Confederate states meant that the United States was not truly aligned with them, and this was the underpinning of Lincoln's strategy. The reward for holding property on the Confederate side was the promise of having their territories as free lands that the Confederate government could utilize. In contrast, the promise of free lands was not only the political promise that the Proclamation implied, but it was also the economic promise of the new economy that the United States was entering.\r\n\r\nAnswer:D.",
