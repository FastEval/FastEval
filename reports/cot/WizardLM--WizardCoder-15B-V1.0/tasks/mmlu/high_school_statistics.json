An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "REASONING:\r\n\r\nWe have a random sample of seven aspirin tablets with known weights that can be assumed to be normally distributed. The corresponding sample mean is 301.5g and the sample standard deviation is 1.66g. \r\n\r\nFrom the given FDA investigation, we have seven different tablets with weights ranging from 299 to 303. However, we are not sure which sample belongs to which individual. Given that there are seven differences in the weights, the most likely explanation is that there are seven individuals. Based on this assumption, we can run a test of equality of variance. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we assume that the distribution of the weights is not the same for all the individuals, but that it is normal with different means and standard deviations. To test this hypothesis, we can use the Levene test. We know that in the Levene test, the null hypothesis is that all samples have equal variances. Therefore, we can calculate the P-value of this test using the formula p-value = 1 - cdf(0.5 * chi-squared distribution with df=k-1), where k is the number of groups. In the case of the given data with seven individuals, we have k=2 and df=1 (since we are testing the hypothesis for only two groups). \r\n\r\nNext, we need to calculate the t-statistics. For each of the seven individuals' weights, we can subtract the sample mean and divide by the sample standard deviation. This gives us a new distribution that we can compare to the normal distribution. The t-statistic for an observation x is calculated as t = (x - mean) / std_error, where mean and std_error are the sample mean and standard error, respectively. Therefore, we have seven t-statistics for the given sample. \r\n\r\nTo calculate the P-value of the hypothesis test for the normality of the data, we can use the standard normal distribution. For each of the t-statistics, we can use the inverse standard normal CDF (which gives us the corresponding z-score) and multiply it by 2 to get the two-tailed P-value. The total P-value is the minimum of the two-tailed P-values. \r\n\r\nHere, the chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom has a P-value of 1 - cdf(0.5 * 1,386), which is less than 0.01. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis (that the distribution of the weights is not normal). Therefore, we have to decide which of the following schemes gives the correct P-value of the hypothesis test for seven groups with known means and standard deviations:\r\n\r\nSCHEME A: P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\r\n\r\nTo get the P-value of the hypothesis test for the given problem, we can use the inverse standard normal CDF with 2-tailed significance level (i.e. P-value = 1 - (1-0.95)^2) to get the corresponding z-score. Therefore, z = (1.54 - sample mean) / sample standard error. The P-value is therefore P(z > 1.644) and can be calculated using a standard normal distribution. \r\n\r\nThis gives us a P-value of P(z > 1.644) = P(-1.554) = 0.134, which is less than 0.01. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that the data has normal distribution.\r\n\r\nThe P-value of this hypothesis test can also be calculated more directly using the standard normal distribution using the formula P(z > |t|) where t is the t statistic. When t > 0 and z > 0, the tail probability decreases and P(z > |t|) approaches 0.05. Therefore, the P-value of the hypothesis test for the given problem can be calculated as P(t > z) = P(z > t), which gives us P(1.54 > 1.644) = 0.033. \r\n\r\nThus, we can obtain the P-value of the hypothesis test for the given problem as P(t > z) = P(1.54 > z), which is 0.033. Therefore, the answer is A. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe process described above can be applied for all the questions in this answer key without any specific changes or additions.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D), 25.3 to 35 minutes. \n\nHere's why:\n\nWe want the shortest time interval, meaning the time interval with the most number of riders. \n\nThe probability distribution of waiting times for 150,000 rides is normally distributed with a mean of 35 and std deviation of 10.\n\nIf 150,000 rides are associated with a mean waiting time of 35 minutes, then the probability of having exactly 100,000 rides is:\n\np(exactly 100,000 rides) = Probability of waiting time equal to 25.3 minutes\n\n= 0.001037\n\nIf we want to estimate the probability that the shortest time interval of two rides is less than 35 minutes, we can use the survival function (complementary cumulative distribution function) of the standard normal distribution, which is approximately 0.9773.\n\nThe survival function at t=25.3 minutes is approximately 0.88.\n\nSo, the probability of having 100,000 rides is 0.001037 times the probability that the shortest time interval of two rides is less than 35 minutes (which in this case is approximately 1 - 0.88 = 0.1198). \n\nThis gives us a probability of approximately 100 times the original probability of 150,000 rides. \n\nTherefore, the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is 25.3 to 35 minutes.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nStatement A and B are related. If all possible outcomes are numerical, they are also mutually exclusive. \r\n\r\nStatement A implies that the outcomes can be counted or measured by a numerical scale.\r\n\r\nStatement B requires that only one outcome can be observed for each experiment. This means that the probability of any outcome can be calculated from the combined probabilities of every mutually exclusive outcome.\r\n\r\nStatement C is a mathematical property of discrete random variables. It states that the expected value (mean) of the random variable is always equal to the sum of the products of each outcome with its corresponding probability. \r\n\r\nWhile the formula is relatively simple (the mean is just the sum of all possible outcomes multiplied by their probabilities), the relationship between each outcome and its probability is crucial to understanding this statement.\r\n\r\nLastly, Statement D requires that approximately 95% of the outcomes will fall within two standard deviations of the mean. The standard deviation is a measure of the variability of the sample mean and is calculated as the square root of the sum of the deviations from the mean squared divided by the sample size. To determine the number of standard deviations an outcome must fall within to be 95% likely, we calculate 1.96 (2 standard deviations) and divide by the standard deviation of the sample. \r\n\r\nSince the derivation of the expression for 95% of outcomes within two standard deviations requires the relationship between each outcome and its probability, we can see that only statements A, B, C, and D are relevant to determining the answer. \r\n\r\nTherefore, all of the given statements are true for all discrete random variables except for which one.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nIn the first option (A), we are assuming that there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 5% level when we reject it at the 10% level. This is not necessarily true. It depends on the size and type of the problem and the level of significance required. When we are working with small samples or more complex problems, it may be more difficult to detect a significant effect at the 5% level when rejecting the null hypothesis at the 10% level.\r\n\r\nIn the second option (B), it is not always possible to determine a hypothesis test's type before analyzing the data. Some data may suggest that a one-sided test is more appropriate than a two-sided test, while other data may indicate a two-sided test is appropriate for a given problem.\r\n\r\nIn the third option (C), the level of significance is inversely proportional to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis. If we require a 1% level of significance, it suggests that we should be almost certain to reject the null hypothesis in 90% of all trials. This should not be confused with the statement that we have a 1% chance of detecting a false positive.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth option (D), the power of a hypothesis test refers to the likelihood of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis with a significant level of evidence. It is essential to choose a test with high power so that we are able to detect an alternative hypothesis with a minimal chance of false positives. This is true regardless of whether we reject the null hypothesis at a 5% or a 1% level.",
