However, it requires a good understanding of the codebase and a lot of time and effort to set up and run. \r\n\r\nMutation-based fuzzing can potentially find more bugs than generational or blackbox fuzzing because of the chance of hitting different execution paths during each generation.

These mechanisms make it difficult for an attacker to reuse a pre-master secret (as the client and server share the same key) and replay the same data.\n\nTo protect against impersonating the server, the client can provide a valid client certificate that is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The server can then verify the client certificate before establishing the TLS session. This ensures that the connecting client is actually who it claims to be.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\n(A. Kerberos server refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.)\r\n\r\nThis is not directly related to the Kerberos ticket lifetimes, but rather to the concept of Time-To-Live (TTL) in the network communication protocols. Whenever a server communicates with a client, it includes a TTL value, which is the maximum time period during which the communication can continue without a response. If the server receives no response within the specified time period, it assumes that the client is dead and terminates the connection. \r\n\r\nBy default, Kerberos servers set their TTL to 5 minutes, which means that if a client fails to send a response to a server within that time, it assumes the server to have died and terminates the connection. However, if the server and client exchange tickets containing time stamps indicating when they expire, the server will be able to check if the ticket has expired before establishing a connection.\r\n\r\n(B. The server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.)\r\n\r\nThis is a valid option because each connection between a client and a server is authenticated using a Kerberos ticket, which includes a start time and an expiration time. If the server does not receive a response from the client before the expiration of the ticket, it will terminate the connection. Therefore, if the ticket\u2019s expiration time is set to 24 hours, the server will be able to detect if the client has not received a response for 24 hours, and terminate the connection if necessary.\r\n\r\n(C. When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.)\r\n\r\nThis is an incorrect explanation because the client has no control over the server clock, and it is possible for the server clock to be out-of-sync with the client clock. Therefore, the client cannot be certain that the expiration time read from the ticket is valid. Instead, the server should query the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock.\r\n\r\n(D. When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.)\r\n\r\nCorrect! This is the correct explanation. If the server trusts the KDC to enforce the maximum ticket lifetime of 24 hours, it should send a query to the KDC to check the ticket before accepting the authentication request. The KDC should check the validity of the ticket according to the following criteria:\r\n\r\n- If the difference between the server's clock and the KDC's clock exceeds the maximum clock skew, refuse to authenticate the user.\r\n- If the ticket's expiration time exceeds 24 hours from the current time, refuse to authenticate the user.\r\n\r\nIf either of these checks fails, the KDC should send an appropriate error message to the client, and the client should not proceed with the authentication process.",

This can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, which can cause any device to crash or become unresponsive until memory is released. The root cause of memory leakage is a failure to free memory which is used by the app but is no longer necessary. This can happen when allocations or deallocations are not properly matched, leading to a buildup of unused memory. \r\n\r\nBuffer-overrun is recognized as a security vulnerability where an attacker can exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. It occurs when a program reads or writes to a section of memory that is larger than the size of the buffer and potentially overwrites adjacent memory locations, leading to unintended control flow and privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nLess processing power is another potential cause of an app\u2019s coding mistake. When the app\u2019s memory usage or processing power is limited, it can cause performance issues or crashes.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Answer: (C) No processing power check\nReasoning: \n\n1. As C/C++ are low-level programming languages, they operate at the lowest hardware level possible and there is always a risk of software errors that can crash the system or cause harm to data. \n\n2. In case of buffer overflow, a program may end up writing or reading beyond the allocated memory buffer, causing the program to produce unexpected behavior or crash. \n\n3. Normal execution flow of the program is interrupted due to this type of error, which can lead to denial of service, loss of data, security breaches or even worst, complete system crashing. \n\n4. To prevent these crashes, it is recommended to implement input validation, error handling, and boundary checks to avoid any unintended memory access. \n\n5. In C/C++ programming, there are several built-in functions like \u201cstrcpy\u201d and \u201cmemcpy\u201d which perform memory copying operations. These functions do not perform any boundary checks or input validation.

            "model_answer": "1. Man in the middle attack: This attack occurs when an attacker is able to intercept and monitor communication between two parties, without them being able to detect the attack. It can happen because the attacker gains unauthorized access or because the communication is transmitted through an unsecured network.\n\n2. Diffie Hellman method: This method is a key exchange protocol based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. It is most commonly used in network security protocols like HTTPS and SSH.\n\n3. Not all parties need to be involved: The attack can only occur if two parties are not joined, but not necessarily authenticated or submitted. For example, if one party assumes a man-in-the-middle position and submits their public key without knowing that it is spoofed, the attack can occur.\n\n4. Submitted: After the parties have agreed on a shared secret, the attacker can intercept and resend a modified version of the public key to the other party. The other party can compute the shared secret using the modified key, leading to the decryption of all future messages.\n\n5. Authenticated: If the parties are authenticated, the attack cannot occur, as they need to present their credentials to the server to obtain the shared secret.\n\n6. Joined: If the parties are physically present at the same location, the attack cannot occur, as they can use other security techniques like VPN or steganography to hide their presence.\n\n7. Shared: The attack can occur if the shared secret is not sufficiently random and guessable. By using large prime numbers to generate the shared secret, the chance of an attacker guessing it is relatively low, but still possible.\n\n8.
