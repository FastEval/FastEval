            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Generational fuzzing is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the given program. The generational fuzzer starts with a population of randomly generated test cases and applies mutations to the population to promote code coverage. This can help the fuzzer find new bugs and vulnerabilities. Additionally, the fuzzer can use the test cases generated during the process to guide the generation of new test cases, which can further expand the scope of the tests generated. Whitebox fuzzing, in contrast, relies on a deep understanding of the program's internal structures and system calls. These types of fuzzers are more likely to find vulnerabilities but may require complex setup and tuning to achieve high code coverage. In this case, whitebox fuzzing may be more appropriate. However, blackbox fuzzing may also be able to find some vulnerabilities if the program is designed to handle unexpected inputs. However, it may be less effective at exploring all lines of code due to the black-box nature of the testing approach. Mutation-based fuzzing is also a popular technique for generating test cases. However, it may not be as effective at discovering as other methods, particularly with complex software systems. Therefore, generational fuzzing is the most likely to explore every line of code in the given program.",

            "question": "Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don\u2019t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.\n2. An attacker impersonating the server.\n\n(A) True, True\n(B) False, False\n(C) True, False\n(D) False, True",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) Impersonation Attack.\n\n*Explaination:*\n\nAn attacker impersonating the server can insert a fake server certificate into the client\u2019s session, and trick the client into trusting that certificate. The attacker can then send malicious packets to the client, with the intention of causing the client to generate incorrect session keys or perform other actions the attacker wants. However, TLS provides several mechanisms to prevent this attack. \r\n\r\nFirstly, if the client is authenticating itself to the server (using a client certificate), the server can be identified based on the client certificate, rather than on the server certificate itself. This means that if an attacker tries to impersonate the server, they need a valid client certificate signed by a legitimate CA. \r\n\r\nSecondly, TLS provides forward secrecy (FS), where each session is associated with a new set of cryptographic keys, generated from the DH key exchange. This means that even if an attacker intercepts the session, they cannot decrypt any subsequent traffic, as the keys are not known to them.\r\n\r\nFurther, TLS requires clients to establish a new session whenever they contact a server that presents a different valid certificate. This ensures that the client has not been compromised and cannot be impersonated. Therefore, if an attacker wants to impersonate the server, they need to obtain a new valid certificate signed by a legitimate CA. This is because without a client certificate, the server cannot uniquely identify the client, and therefore cannot prevent the attacker from establishing a new session and forwarding the traffic. \r\n\r\nTherefore, an attacker impersonating the server cannot cause any serious security issues, as long as the server and client are both honest and behave correctly. The presence of a client certificate prevents such attacks.",

Load and store instructions can be executed without validation in a sandboxed environment.

All indirect loads or stores can be prohibited in sandboxed code, because an attacker can manipulate the register containing the memory address to execute unauthorized operations.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is B - No storage check in the external memory. \r\n\r\nTo explain B - No storage check in the external memory, consider the following scenario:\r\nAn app is written using C/C++ programming language to receive input from the user. The user can input a very long string such as a large text file or a very large array. The string is then stored in a variable. However, the variable is not large enough to store the entire input string. As a result, when the input string is copied to this variable, the app may encounter buffer overflow. This occurs because the variable is not large enough to store the entire input string. Buffer overflow occurs when an app accesses memory outside its bounds and overwrites adjacent memory. It can cause security vulnerabilities such as crashes, data corruption, and denial-of-service attacks.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is important to ensure that the size of the variable being used to store the input string is large enough to hold the entire input string, and to validate the input before performing any operations on the input which could cause buffer overflow. Additionally, it is not recommended to use predefined C/C++ functions which have limited storage limits, such as scanf(), strcpy(), etc. These functions may not be able to handle very large input strings and may cause buffer overflows.",
