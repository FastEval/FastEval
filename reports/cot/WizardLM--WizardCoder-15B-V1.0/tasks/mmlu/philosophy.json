            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\n- Aesthetics refers to creating \"beautiful\" or \"pleasant\" designs, patterns, shapes, and textures. It is usually associated with art, design, and craft.\r\n- Essential to our existence refers to objects that are necessary or essential for our survival. They are usually precious or valuable items such as food, water, shelter, weapons, etc. that are necessary for our survival.\r\n- Unimportant to most people refers to objects that are not as necessary or essential to our survival but are still beautiful or pleasant. It could be things that are just trendy, or things that are simply decorations that do not contribute much to the overall aesthetic appeal.\r\n- Not essential to our existence refers to objects that are just \"nice to have\" but do not necessarily contribute aesthetic value. They might be objects that are decorations, or tools that we use for entertainment, or objects that we use for temporary or edible uses.\r\n- Rarely viewed refers to objects that are not visible to most of us and are typically seen only within a specialist circle. They are usually things that we do not typically interact with.\r\n\r\nBased on the given options, the correct answer is option B. As aesthetics deals with unimportant objects, option B is the correct one.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "REASONING:According to the given question statement, the answer should be D because \"Socrates, an unexamined life is a tragedy because it results in grievous harm to the soul.\" According to the passage, \"the soul,\" according to the dictionary, refers to the psychic vibration that goes through the human mind and consists of consciousness, thought, and emotion. It is also known as the \"spiritual\" or \"conscious\" side of human beings. Therefore, the unexamined life of Socrates is tragic because it damages or destroys the innermost parts of the soul, resulting in an injury or damage to physical and spiritual well-being.\r\n\r\nANSWER:D (The soul damaged)",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nPlato's view on beauty is based on the idea of objects that are beautiful beyond description. In his works, he frequently illustrates beauty through such objects or experiences. We know that objects and beauty are deeply interconnected and the way we perceive these objects affects our understanding of beauty. \r\n\r\nAccording to Plato, any object, be it in the natural world or in our daily lives, that fulfills these criteria is considered beautiful. Objects that are beautiful always have a strong sense of spontaneity and magnetic quality, and they have mesmerizing beauty that makes us feel awe or ecstasy. These objects are found in art, architecture, fairy tales, sculpture, technologies, and more. \r\n\r\nThe term \"not of this world\" means that the object does not exist in the present form and is an artefact learned from a past time or culture. The object is beautiful, but it is not of the present time, as Plato rightly points out, but rather a future reality that has yet to come into being. We can also say that objects in our current form are beautiful, but they are not without their limitations or imperfections, and they are always changing and evolving.\r\n\r\nThus, Plato's view on the nature and essence of beauty is that it is found in everyday objects and crosses time and culture. It cannot be achieved in the present world and it is, in fact, a future reality that we cannot fully understand and appreciate without pushing ourselves to its core. However, we should never forget that beauty cannot be measured objectively and it is ultimately relative to our own perspective and definition of beauty.",

In reality, we cannot create an imaginary situation where one\u2019s actions are wrong. Therefore, one is always aware of wrongdoing. \r\n\r\nOption B:\r\nOne knows that one\u2019s actions are wrong, but does them anyway.\r\nIn this case, incontinence is exaggerated. We seek to exaggerate our wrongdoing and report it to others. This does not bring good results. \r\n\r\nOption C:\r\nOne knows that one\u2019s feelings are inappropriate, and does not act on them.\r\nIn this case, incontinence is hasty. We act inappropriately without giving thought to the consequences. This results in a lack of self-control and propriety. \r\n\r\nOption D:\r\nOne does the right action, but for the wrong reason.\r\nIn this case, incontinence is lack of deep understanding. We act out of self-interest without being aware of the deeper meaning and implications of our actions. This leads to unwanted consequences and behaviors that may damage our well-being. \r\n\r\nStep 4: Choose the option that aligns best with Aristotle\u2019s line of thought\r\nThe option that aligns best with Aristotle\u2019s line of thought is B.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First, let's look at the options:\n\n(A) are the result of applying arbitrarily stringent standards.\n(B) are based on linguistic confusions.\n(C) are logically self-refuting.\n(D) grow from the consistent application of ordinary standards.\n\nThe first option seems to best describe Nagel's claim. According to the conventional wisdom of logic, it is entirely possible for disputed issues to arise in philosophical debates. For example, the idea of inevitability has been put forward by different philosophers to different extents. Some philosophers may argue for its truth by intuition, while others may argue for its fallacy by demonstration. As a result, Nagel's first option seems most plausible. This can be further validated by noting that both scholars and philosophers will seek to find the truth, and may reject any particular argument as too fanciful or controversial.\n\nThe second and third options seem less likely. It is possible for disputes to arise based on linguistic confusion, but it is very rare in philosophical discourse. On the other hand, it is possible for logical contradictions to arise in philosophical debates, but Nagel seems to be most accusatory when he claims that there are no such cases.\n\nFinally, the fourth option seems most consistent. In philosophical discourse, there is a general consensus on the correct way to analyze a claim, and the standards used will be consistent across all philosophical perspectives. Nagel's fourth option makes it clear that his standard of truth is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (D) grow from the consistent application of ordinary standards.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n1. Rawls conceives of the original contract as one to establish the principles of justice for the basic structure of society so that they can govern other area of life. By establishing the basic structure of justice, Rawls wants to lay the groundwork for the formation of a system of governmental institutions in the future. This can only be achieved through harmonious interplay between the different constituencies in society that Rawls hates due to their lack of moral sense. \r\n\r\n2. The second and third and fourth clauses of the contract state that Rawls wants to establish the principles of justice and content of morality of the society. These have nothing to do with each other but the third clause essentially sets up the oligarchic system that Rawls wants to destroy.\r\n\r\n3. Based on the first and second clauses, Rawls wants to enter a particular society, set up a particular form of government and to establish the basic structure of justice for the society. He specifically does not want to establish the content of morality as it contradicts the basic structure of justice. Since the content of morality constitutes a harmful institution, this clause is mainly used by Rawls to gain an advantage over other governments.\r\n\r\n4. Therefore, the original contract given to Rawls expresses their plan that they wish to establish a basic structure of justice for the society but in a very harsh fashion possibly destroying the oligarchic systems that already exist. \r\n\r\n(D)",

            "model_answer": "For Socrates, the soul is harmed by lack of courage. Socrates was generally known for his courage, which is often misunderstood for weakness or inexperience. Hence, he often insists upon more careful selection of friends and a stronger work ethic to overcome this limitation. Overall, Socrates' reputation for courage and self-sacrificing mentality would hinder his development and growth as a philosopher. As such, he cannot be considered in the field of knowledge, wealth, community, or any other topic of interest. As a conclusion, we conclude that Socrates' soul is hindered by lack of courage.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's look at the first premise, which is that an action that leads to the greatest total happiness is an essential component of morality. This means that morality is an a priori principle that cannot be explained through experience. It can only be understood by humans who have experienced life and have developed a deep understanding of happiness.\n\nNext, let's look at the second premise, which is that we should always act on maxims that we can will to become universal laws. The reason for this is that morality is not a weighty part of our reasoning process, but is instead an intuitive and religious belief that we take for granted. Therefore, the successful application of morality requires us to be willing to let go of our preconceptions and seek new principles that we can test and refine over time.\n\nFinally, let's look at the third premise, which is that we should always behave in such a way as a perfectly virtuous person would behave. This is not an absolute rule, but it speaks to the importance of considering the preferences and tastes of a higher power. While moral reasoning is certainly a valuable contribution to our understanding of the world, it cannot substitute for considering divine or transcendental principles.\n\nBased on these premises, we can conclude that morality requires us to act towards the greatest achievement of the highest degree, act on universal truths, and behave in a virtuous way that considers the preferences of a higher power. We should strive to follow these principles to the utmost, and to use our reasoning powers to discover and develop new morals that are in accord with the divine will.\r\n\r\nAnswer: (C)",
