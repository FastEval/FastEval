            "model_answer": "a.Loop gain should be unity (D)\r\n\r\nExplanation: The loop gain of an oscillator is the ratio between the amplitude of the output signal and the amplitude of the feedback signal (plus any additional components such as attenuation and delay). Since the loop gain must be greater than or equal to unity, this means that the feedback signal should be as strong or stronger than the input signal. This is because increased gain of the feedback signal increases the gain of the output, thereby driving it to produce an increased amplitude of output signal. Therefore, (D) is a correct answer.\r\n\r\nb.Loop gain should be less than unity (C)\r\n\r\nExplanation: The loop gain of an oscillator must be less than unity so that the output signal decreases away from the feedback signal, thereby preventing any recursion. This is because a response is required for the oscillator to maintain its oscillation and prevent the loop from being closed off. Therefore, (C) is a correct answer.\r\n\r\nc.The phase of a feedback signal with respect to input should be 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0 (C)\r\n\r\nExplanation: The phase of a feedback signal with respect to the input signal should be 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0 because the output signal should be synchronous with the input signal. This is because the purpose of an oscillator is to generate a periodic signal that changes in response to a varying input signal. Therefore, (C) is a correct answer.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (D).",

A potentiometer is a measurement device that allows only a limited range of values to be displayed due to its nature of varying resistance as a function of applied voltage.\r\n\r\n2. A centre-zero galvanometer uses two metal plates that are connected in a common center-zero point, which allows it to provide better accuracy as compared to a single metal plate.\r\n\r\n3. Accurate measurement of DC voltage is difficult due to several factors such as load, temperature, and other factors and can vary significantly from one measurement to another.\r\n\r\n4. The direct measurement using a voltmeter is limited due to its inaccuracy due to the different biasing effects of the load on the current that causes it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer is:\r\n\r\n(C) It uses centre zero galvanometer instead of voltmeter.\r\n\r\nThis is because potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter.",

            "model_answer": "First, we need to determine the resistance of the single phase one pulse controlled circuit. This circuit has a resistance of R and a source voltage of 400 sin(314 t). After solving for R, we get:\n\nR = 400 sin(314 t) / 314 t\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nR = \\frac{400}{314}sin(314t)\n\nNext, we need to determine the maximum load counter emf for this circuit. This can be done by measuring the voltage at the load port using a meter and calculating the maximum and minimum peak voltages:\n\nPmax = 200 V\nPmin = -200 V\n\nSo the maximum load counter emf for this circuit is:\n\nR * Vmax = 200 V\n\nUsing the values provided, we get the simplified expression:\n\nR * Vmax = \\frac{400}{314}sin(314t)(200 V) = 200 sin(314t)\n\nSince the maximum load counter emf for this circuit is equal to 200 V, we can now determine the range of firing angle control for the single phase one pulse controlled circuit.\n\nSince the range of motion for a sinusoidal signal with period T is [0, 2T], we know that the t values for the given source voltage are between 0 and \\frac{2\\pi}{314} = 0.52 radians. Therefore, the firing angle control should be set within the range [0, 0.52] degrees.\n\nFrom the first part of the question, we know that the circuit has a resistance of R and a source voltage of 400 sin(314 t). We also know that the maximum load counter emf for this circuit is 200 V. We can use these values to determine the range of firing angle control for this circuit.\n\nSince 200 V is less than half of the maximum load counter emf, the circuit should be able to withstand a burst of 400 V for a given load counter emf. The burst occurs at a time of 0.52 radians, which corresponds to 27.48 degrees in a sinusoidal signal with a period of 1 sec.\n\nTherefore, the range of firing angle control for a single phase one pulse controlled circuit with a resistance of R and a load counter emf of 200 V is [0, 27.48] degrees.\n\nAnswer:\n\n(C) 60\u00b0 to 120\u00b0.",

Then the electric field in the gap between them is a uniform field. \r\n\r\nFor an infinite plate, we cannot consider this approach, however, we can use the concept of cylindrical symmetry. If we consider a slab of the same thickness and width as the plates in series, then the gap between them will also be a slab. Thus, in this case, the electric field will depend on the position of the field points. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe problem also states that both plates are charged, and if the polarity is the same, then they would behave symmetrically. Thus, we can assume that option A is correct.\r\n\r\nIf the polarity is different, then one of the plates would be dissipating the charge and the other plate would be conducting. In this case, the electric field would be half the electric field produced by the conducting plate since it is dissipating half the charge.

The duty cycle of the signal: The duty cycle refers to the ratio of the time spent high voltage (50% in most cases) to the total time spent switching. Increasing the duty cycle will increase the amplitude of the signal and thereby decrease the rise time of the signal.\r\n\r\n3.
