            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "A, B, and D are correct answers.\r\n\r\nexplanation:\r\n\r\n- Zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are two types of DNA-binding proteins. DNA-binding is a process wherein a protein binds to a nucleotide (or a DNA or a RNA) and forms a complex with it. DNA-binding proteins are essential for many cellular processes such as replication, transcription, and translation.\r\n- A type of DNA-binding protein that is involved in the control of translation is the exonuclease. It is a type of protein that allows a mRNA to be translated if the nucleotides are present in the correct order. Exonucleases include DNA-binding factor (DBF) and IRES protease.\r\n- A component of ribosomes that is involved in creating the proteins found in the nucleus of cells is the ribosome. The ribosome is a small complex of DNA and proteins that creates proteins by breaking down monomeric DNA into smaller fragments.\r\n- The hemoglobin is a complex organic compound made up of two subunits, a red-blood cell's plasma protein and a deoxyhemoglobin. The hemoglobin provides oxygen to the body, protection for the cells, and helps in transporting goods and nutrients between cells. The component deoxyhemoglobin is important for the production of red blood cells. DNA is found in the nucleus and assembled into a complex with deoxyhemoglobin and forming the hemoglobin. It is found in the hemoglobin in blood cells.",

            "model_answer": "Reasoning: \r\n\r\nThe question asks what is the expected frequency of females affected with X-linked recessive disease. \r\n\r\nWe start by breaking down the question into similar parts. \r\n\r\nGiven: \r\n- 10% of males are affected with X-linked recessive disease in population. \r\n\r\nTo find: \r\n- What is the expected frequency of affected females. \r\n\r\nWe can use mathematical tools to solve this problem. Let's try to find the expected frequency of affected females based on the given data. \r\n\r\nExpected frequency of female affected = Probability of having X-linked recessive disease AND female / Total population\r\n\r\nProbability of having X-linked recessive disease = 10% of males = 0.1\r\n\r\nNow, let's assume that there are 10,000,000 people in the population. \r\n\r\nWhat is the total population? \r\n\r\n- Total number of people in the population can be calculated as follows: 10,000,000 (1,000,000 male and 9,000,000 female). \r\n\r\nWe can find the probability of having X-linked recessive disease for each individual in the population. \r\n\r\n- Probability of having X-linked recessive disease for a given individual can be calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n  p = 10% * (1,000,000 / 10,000,000) = 1% \r\n  \r\n  - 1% is the probability of having X-linked recessive disease for a male. \r\n  - We assume that the probability of having X-linked recessive disease for a female is also 1%, since the question doesn't mention any specific gender. \r\n\r\nNow, let's find the expected frequency of female affected in the population. \r\n\r\n- Expected frequency of female affected = 1% * (40% female in population) * (1000000 / 1000000) = 400 \r\n\r\n- 400 is the expected number of female affected in the population. \r\n\r\nThus, the expected frequency of female affected in the population is 400 per 1000000. \r\n\r\nAnswer: (B) We can use mathematical tools to solve the problem. The expected frequency of females affected with X-linked recessive disease can be calculated using the formula:\r\n\r\nExpected frequency of female affected = Probability of having X-linked recessive disease AND female / Total population\r\n\r\nWe can assume that the probability of having X-linked recessive disease for a given individual is 10%, since the question doesn't mention specific gender. \r\n\r\nBut we need to make sure that this doesn't overestimate the number of females affected with X-linked recessive disease. Using the standard rule of thumb, we can estimate the number of males affected with X-linked recessive disease as 1 in 400 and adjust the estimate for females as follows: \r\n\r\n1 in 400 males affected with X-linked recessive disease = probability of female affected with X-linked recessive disease = 1 in 16,667 (one in one hundred thousand) females. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the expected frequency of female affected in the population is 1 in 16,667 (one in one hundred thousand) or 363 per 1000000.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning step-by-step:\r\n\r\nIn DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), adenine (A) is a nucleotide that codes for the purine (base) thymine. DNA contains four bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine) and has a specific order for the nucleotides. Adenine (A) normally pairs with thymine (T), meaning it acquires a hydrogen bond when bound to thymine. As a nucleotide, thymine can only form covalent bonds with itself. Therefore, adenine normally pairs with thymine.\r\n\r\nAnswer:D(Which means base Thymine is anticipated to follow base Adenine.) \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nThymine is the base that codes for the purine (thio) group of amino acids (adenine and uracil) in DNA. The purine nucleotide is the base responsible for the synthesis of proteins. Adenine and guanine are labeled as bases for DNA repair in case of mutations or errors in sequencing. Overall, adenine pairs with thymine to establish the first backbone of the nucleotide.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Autosomal dominant inheritance means that the affected patient has a genetic predisposition to inherit the disease from their parents. This inheritance pattern is present in many diseases, including cancers, diseases of the skin, and many types of neurological disorders. Patients can also be diagnosed as having X-linked inheritance, meaning they have a genetic predisposition to inherit only from their mother, possibly through chromosomal sex disorder.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, autosomal recessive inheritance happens when a person has a genetic predisposition to inherit the disease from one half of their chromosome. This predisposition often occurs in familial tumors, such as those that can occur in a woman who inherits from her male parent. X-linked recessive inheritance, also known as mitochondrial complex (MIC) inheritance, is much less common, and occurs when a person has a genetic predisposition to inherit the disease from their sister or brother without regard for chromosomal sex.\r\n\r\nThus, the answer to this question is (A) A stands for autosomal dominant inheritance, (B) B stands for autosomal recessive inheritance, and (C) C stands for X-linked dominant inheritance, or (D) D stands for X-linked recessive inheritance.",

This restricts the availability of other chromosomes and leads to low female and male reproduction. \n\nB) This is because large numbers of DNA markers have been identified and combined into this one chromosome, which make it possible to make more accurate predictive models, which enabling larger families to take advantage of the extra resources.\n\nC) This is because approximately 50% of the chromosomes are present in the X and Y regions, which form a long arm of the chromosome, rather than forming separate chromosomes. \n\nD) This is because by definition, most of the DNA is involved in the construction of proteins that control cellular functions.

The offspring of parents who were exposed to war years ago will most likely be exposed to various social and economic interactions that were not present or operated at that time. It is true that hunger and natural disasters can shape intergenerational transmission, but only hunger can cause it. Eating disorders can be transmitted between generations.

However, the risk of each outcome is highly dependent on the extent of untreated phenylketonuria in the mother and the development of disease in the infant. \r\n\r\n1. If the likelihood of untreated phenylketonuria in the mother is very low, both outcomes have a low probability of occurrence. In this scenario, there is not enough evidence to establish a risk of actual abnormality. This can happen if the mother is already receiving treatment for untreated phenylketonuria, or if there are no signs or symptoms of the disease that would suggest treatment needs.\r\n\r\nHowever, the risk of mortality is still unknowable because it requires clinical confirmation through laboratory testing. \r\n\r\n2. If the likelihood of untreated phenylketonuria in the mother is intermediate to high, both outcomes have a medium probability of occurrence. In this scenario, there is some evidence for a risk of actual abnormality, but it is not high enough to be significant or life-threatening. This can happen if the mother has received treatment for untreated phenylketonuria but the symptoms do not seem to be severe enough to warrant treatment.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a binary decision between low and medium risk can be made to provide a general guide for risk assessment in the infant's future healthcare planning. \r\n\r\nOverall, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria can be considered to be low to medium in most situations.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "A. nonsense mutations.\r\n\r\nExon skipping leads to the creation of two or more new exons in the same gene. These new exons accumulate into large intron-less regions called non-coding complexes (NCX) that can carry either non-functional exons or functional variants. The creation of NCX is typically caused by insertion of a novel sequence, which can become spliced inward or outward to link two existing exons. The affected exons can also become non-coding after a splice donor-acceptor region is ablated, resulting in a frameshift mutation that leads to the creation of a new exon.\r\n\r\nB. regulatory mutations.\r\n\r\nRegulatory mutations, also known as functional variants, involve changes in the DNA sequence around regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers, and insulators. These changes can affect gene expression and can result in changes in the splicing behavior or the impact of the regulatory element on other genes. \r\n\r\nC. RNA processing mutations.\r\n\r\nRNA processing mutations can result in abnormalities in the processing of transcript mRNAs, most often resulting in premature termination or splicing defects. These abnormalities can be caused by inaccurate processing of genomic DNA, which can result in non-standard splice sites or portions of exons being processed incorrectly.\r\n\r\nD. silent mutations.\r\n\r\nSilent mutations, also known as non-coding variants, involve changes in the DNA sequence that do not affect protein-coding gene expression or splicing. However, some silent mutations can still affect transcription and replication of protein coding genes. Silent mutations can range from nucleotide mutations that do not affect gene expression or splicing (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) to structural variants that completely disrupt DNA (e.g., deletions and indels) that result in the loss or ablation of a transcript.\r\n\r\nGiven the wide range of exon skipping pathways, mutations can come from any one of these pathways. Some methods of identifying exon skipping mutations are targeted sequencing, which can analyze the DNA sequence surrounding exon boundaries to identify mutations in exon skipping events, and deep sequencing, which can analyze the DNA sequence of large gene or exon regions to capture mutations that occur far from exon boundaries.",
