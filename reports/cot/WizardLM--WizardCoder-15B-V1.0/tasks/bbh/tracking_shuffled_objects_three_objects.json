Therefore, the dance can end up with either Claire or Alice dancing with Ophelia, Lola, or Izzi.\n\nSince the dance can end up with either Claire or Alice dancing with Ophelia, Lola, or Izzi, we need to consider both possibilities. \n\n1. Claire has Ophelia dancing with her partner\nIn this case, Claire and Bob cannot switch partners, as that would result in a one-sided dance with Ophelia, and therefore a dance that does not conclude with the correct dance partners. Therefore, Claire can only dance with Lola or Izzi. \n\n2. Alice has Ophelia dancing with her partner:\nIn this case, Alice and Claire cannot switch partners, as that would result in a one-sided dance with Ophelia, and therefore a dance that does not conclude with the correct dance partners. Therefore, Alice can only dance with Lola or Izzi. \n\n3. Alice has Lola dancing with her partner:\nIn this case, Alice and Bob cannot switch partners, as that would result in a one-sided dance with Lola, and therefore a dance that does not conclude with the correct dance partners. Therefore, Alice can only dance with Izzi. \n\n4. Alice has Izzi dancing with her partner:\nIn this case, Bob can only dance with Alice if Claire switches partners with either Lola or Ophelia. However, Claire can only dance with Izzi if Alice switches partners with either Lola or Ophelia. Therefore, Alice must dance with Bob. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Lola.",
