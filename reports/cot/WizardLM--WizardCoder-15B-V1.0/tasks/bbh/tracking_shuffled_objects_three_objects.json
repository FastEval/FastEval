Ophelia, Jamie, and Rodrigo all started as partners but the underlying logic is that they danced together initially.\r\n\r\n3. The dance takes place at a square, so each partner is always paired with another dancer.\r\n\r\n4. Alice and Ophelia switch partners. Bob and Jamie switch partners.

Alice is now playing cheerleader. (The original position of Bob was right winger in position 2, and the original position of Claire was benchwarmer in position 3. After Alice swaps positions with Bob, they both have a new position in lineup, and after Alice swaps positions with Claire, they all have a new position.)\n5. We can see that Alice plays cheerleader because her original position was benchwarmer in position 3, which is replaced by Claire after the swap, and her new position in lineup is right winger in position 2 which is replaced by Bob after the swap.\r\n\r\n6.
