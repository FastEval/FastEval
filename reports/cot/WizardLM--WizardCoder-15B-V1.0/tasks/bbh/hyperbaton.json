The two concepts are not interdependent and therefore they should be placed in the order \"brand-new ...\" to indicate that \"enormous\" is a subordinate clause. \"German drinking motorcycle\", on the other hand, is a compound noun that requires \"brand-new\" and \"enormous\" to appear together to make sense.
