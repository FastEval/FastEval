Therefore, the answer cannot be (A), (B), or (C). \n\n3. To proceed further, we need to break down the object itself. \n\n4. The convertible is an object that is older than the motorcyle and truck. \n\n5. Therefore, it cannot be the oldest. \n\n6. The motorcyle is neither the oldest nor the oldest. \n\n7. It is either the oldest or the second oldest. \n\n8. Since the motorcyle is newer than the truck, it cannot be the oldest. \n\n9. Therefore, the answer must be (C). \n\n10. By this reasoning, it is proven that the truck is the oldest vehicle in the antique car show. \n\n11. Therefore, the final answer is (C).",

However, if we have the same number of apples, then we need to compare the prices to determine the cheapest. Apples are clearly more expensive than the mangoes and peaches, so the cheapest is apples.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) The apples are the cheapest.",
