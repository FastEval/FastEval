When they arrive at the coffee shop, Susan must wait for the bell to ring, which means they must have gone to the mall first. Since she left the mall at 11am, they must have gone there before that time. The closest time they could have gone back to the Eiffel Tower was at 12pm, and at that time they had already started their trip to the coffee shop. Therefore, they could have gone from 12pm to 6pm. The optimum time would be between 1pm and 12pm. \n\nWe can further optimize this option by checking if all the other people the surveyed saw Susan driving to the water park and buying clothes at the mall. If indeed all that happened, it could mean that Susan did not wait for the bell to ring and did not go back to the Eiffel Tower. In this case, the time option would be be 6pm to 12pm.",

Linda saw Jason getting a coffee at the cafe from 10am to 3pm.\r\n- This is a strong indicator since the time frame is close to when he woke up, but it is still possible that the cafe was closed during that time. This could be confirmed based on the context and other sources.\r\n\r\nSince the time frame is quite short, the probability that the cafe was closed is very high. It could be because of the rain, it could be that the cafe manager forgot to open the door and left the plate empty, or it could be that there were other people inside who interrupted the coffee shower.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we cannot be sure if Linda saw Jason getting a coffee or the cafe was closed or if there were other people inside who interrupted the coffee shower. But it is likely that he saw Jason getting a coffee and he did not know.\r\n\r\n3.

Although we have not mentioned the actual times where each event occurred, we do know that Richard, Samantha, Michael, and Sarah had to have arrived at different times since they all saw Andrew eat before closing.\r\n- If Andrew did not know when the art studio was closed, he would not have visited the library at all since it is likely to have been closed already. It is unlikely for him to visit the electronic store or deli between 4pm and 6pm, so 2pm to 3pm is the only option. \r\n- If Richard saw Andrew go to the electronics store from 8am to 10am, it means that Richard had to come in late to catch the art director's daughter and hang out with her. Richard may not have driven or had breakfast before the art studio was closed. Therefore, the first leg of the trip was Richard trying to catch the art director's attention.\r\n- If Samantha saw Andrew fix their computer at the electronic store from 10am to 2pm, it means they had to have had breaks before heading back to the art studio to have the time to fix their computer. It is possible that Richard had already caused them to wait for their lunch and had arrived too late.\r\n- If Michael saw Andrew reading at the library from 3pm to 4pm, it means he had to have arrived early to catch a late bus to catch the art director's daughter and hang out with her. Because the bus did not leave until 4pm, it is most likely that Michael had been cleaning before closing the art studio.\r\n- If Sarah saw Andrew buying lunch at the deli from 4pm to 6pm, it means she had to have had lunch before closing the art studio. She may not have arrived after being out of work.\r\n- Therefore, the art studio closing time works as follows:\r\n    - If Richard and Samantha had not yet arrived for lunch, they would have missed the art studio closing time.\r\n    - If Michael and Sarah had not yet arrived for lunch, they would have missed the art studio closing time.\r\n    - If they had arrived before 10am and had their lunch to eat, they would have been able to catch the art director's daughter and hang out with her before closing.\r\n    - If they had left after 10am and had arrived early for lunch, they would not have missed the art studio closing time.",

            "model_answer": "We start by listing all of the times and the events they occured. \n\nAt 9am, William woke up, he did not have a meeting yet so he continued to do his morning routine before getting ready for work. \n\nAfter 9am to 11am, Linda saw William playing tennis along with a group of friends. Linda knew that William lived with her roommate and had done some of her homework. Most likely, she was helping her roommates practice their tennis skills.\n\nNext, Emily saw William attending class at a school from 11am to 1pm. Emily had no idea where William was or what type of school it was. However, she did see him playing tennis. Likely, she had heard about her school's tennis program.\n\nFinally, Nancy saw William walking in the garden during her afternoon commute from 6pm to 7pm. Nancy knew that William had gone to school after work and they had been walking together for hours.\n\nAfter 7pm, the coffee shop was already closed and both Nancy and Emily were expected to return home. William was only waiting for Nancy's goodbye.\n\nWe can see that William did not have any meetings, only appearance at school. It is likely that the coffee shop was closed early in the morning before any events or meetings took place. \n\nGiven this context, the only times that could have allowed William to visit the coffee shop were between 6pm to 7pm or 1pm to 6pm. Options A and B cannot be selected, as neither time period includes any time after 7pm. Therefore, the answer is (C): 11am to 1pm.",

            "correct_answer": "(B)",
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\nWe can see from the events that Hannah slept from 5am to 7am. Therefore, the time she could have gone to the beach is between 7am and 9am. Since Ashley and Jennifer were also seen leaving the house at 9am and getting a coffee or taking photos at the cafe, and the beach was then closed after 8pm, it is unlikely that Hannah could have gone any earlier or later than this range.\r\n\r\nHence, the correct answer is (A) 7pm to 8pm.",
