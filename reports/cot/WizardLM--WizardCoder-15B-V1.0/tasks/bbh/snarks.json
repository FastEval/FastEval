The word \"worst\" conveys the idea of negative sentiment and the overall tone of the statement suggests anger.\r\n\r\n2. The word \"trolley\" is not a widely known term in retail and may convey the idea of a problematic item or someone who lacks respect for quality.\r\n\r\n3. The phrase \"of returns around the store\" suggests a specific location or context.\r\n\r\n4. The phrase \"putting them back\" may make it sound as if the returns were put back into storage instead of being properly sorted.\r\n\r\n5. The overall tone of the statement suggests this is a personal opinion, not based on credible research or expert opinions.\r\n\r\nBased on these reasons, we can conclude that the statement \"One of the worst things to do working in retail was pushing a trolley of returns around the store putting them back\" is a sarcastic statement.\r\n\r\n(A)\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe statement \"One of the worst things to do working in retail was pushing a trolley of returns around the store putting them back\" conveys negative sentiment in an sarcastic manner.

The word \"returns\" suggests a specific location and the phrase \"around the store\" suggests that it's a particular occupation or activity.

            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nI assume that the lecturer assigned two statements to answer the question, and the question was asking which one is sarcastic. The first statement can be interpreted as saying that he's terribly disappointed when he's drunk with his new relationship material, which can sometimes hurt when it comes to making conflicting statements or ideas. For example, if you say to him, \"I'm excited for this new relationship, but I'm afraid you'll be drunk too.\" He may feel like you're being sarcastic and flatter him, which can dehumanize him if not handled with caution.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the second statement can be interpreted as saying that he's glad he's got a new relationship material, which may be gross and unpleasant, but it may be a necessary step for his new commitment. For example, if you say to him, \"You are such a good friend! How will you ever get over the terrible drunk relationship that you have?\" He may think you're being sarcastic and demeaning, which could potentially hurt him and his romantic life.\r\n\r\nHowever, the two statements are not related by context, and neither one can be marked as sarcastic. It would be best to choose one of the two statements and let the lecturer assess it further.
