This is because the Golgi apparatus is responsible for processing and sorting proteins and other molecules before they are exported to the cell membrane.\n\n(B) It is typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face.\n\nThe Golgi apparatus is indeed associated with small secretory vesicles, which are located near its cis face. These vesicles are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of proteins and other molecules.\n\n(C) Its composite flattened cisternae are continuous with one another.\n\nThe Golgi apparatus consists of a network of cisternae, which are small, flattened structures. However, they are not continuous with one another. Instead, they are separated by intercalated spaces called the intercalated spaces.\n\n(D) Glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs prior to the protein's entry into its lumen.\n\nGlycosylation of secretory proteins does occur prior to their entry into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. This is because the proteins are first processed and modified in the Golgi apparatus before being transported to the endoplasmic reticulum for further processing and secretion.\n\nBased on the evaluation of each statement, the correct answer is:\n\n(D)",

When a competitive inhibitor binds to the enzyme, it prevents the substrate from binding to the enzyme's active site. This results in a decrease in the enzyme's activity, as the substrate cannot be converted into a product.
