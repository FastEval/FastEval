How will the stars appear to your eyes?\n\n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.\n(B) You will see two distinct stars.\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.\n(D) The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the angular separation of the two stars and the angular resolution of the eyes.\n\nAngular separation refers to the angle between two stars in the sky. If the angular separation is smaller than the angular resolution of the eyes, it means that the stars are close enough to be seen as a single point of light.\n\nAngular resolution is the smallest angle that the human eye can resolve, which is about 0.004 degrees.\n\nSince the angular separation is smaller than the angular resolution, the two stars will appear to the eyes as a single point of light.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(D) It rotates much faster than any other terrestrial world.\n\nExplanation: Earth's strong magnetic field is primarily due to its rapid rotation. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of charged particles in the Earth's core, which are influenced by the planet's rotation. The faster the rotation, the stronger the magnetic field. Earth's rotation is approximately 1 rotation per day, which is much faster than the other terrestrial worlds.",
