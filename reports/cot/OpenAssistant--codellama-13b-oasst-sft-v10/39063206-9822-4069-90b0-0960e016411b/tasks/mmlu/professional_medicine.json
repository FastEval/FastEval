The use of various conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been ineffective. Sulfasalazine treatment also has not resulted in improvement. The most appropriate next step in treatment is administration of a drug that inhibits which of the following?\n\n(A) Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4\n(B) Epidermal growth factor\n(C) Interleukin-1 (IL-1)\n(D) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking for the drug that inhibits the inflammation caused by ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the spine, and it is characterized by the formation of fibrous tissue in the spinal joints. The inflammation caused by this disease is a key factor in the development of the disease.\n\nThe options given are:\n\n(A) Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)\n(B) Epidermal growth factor (EGF)\n(C) Interleukin-1 (IL-1)\n(D) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)\n\nThe correct answer is (D) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1).\n\nTNF-\u03b1 is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response to injury and infection. It is involved in the development of ankylosing spondylitis and other inflammatory diseases. By inhibiting the production of TNF-\u03b1, the treatment can help to reduce the inflammation and pain associated with ankylosing spondylitis.",

In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence. The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is\n\n(A) collateral estoppel\n(B) proximate cause\n(C) res ipsa loquitur\n(D) respondeat superior",

            "model_answer": "The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is (A) collateral estoppel.\n\nReasoning:\n\nCollateral estoppel is a legal doctrine that allows a party to use the conduct of another party as evidence of their own negligence. In this case, the patient is using the fact that the surgical sponge was left in her pelvis as evidence of negligence on the part of the surgeon. The other options do not fit the context as well:\n\n(B) Proximate cause: This term refers to the cause that directly led to an event, not a legal concept.\n(C) Res ipsa loquitur: This Latin phrase means \"the thing speaks for itself\" and is used to indicate that the facts speak for themselves, without the need for further explanation.\n(D) Respondeat superior: This term refers to a legal doctrine that allows a superior court to review a lower court's decision, not a legal concept related to negligence.",
