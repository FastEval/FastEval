            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) the vessels are contracted.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen the left ventricle contracts, it pushes the blood out of the heart into the aorta. The aorta is a large blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart to the rest of the body. As the left ventricle contracts, the pressure inside the aorta increases, causing the aorta to contract as well. This contraction of the aorta allows the blood to flow through the vessel.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n(A) The atria are not involved in the flow of blood through the vessels. They are responsible for pumping blood into the left ventricle, but they do not directly affect the flow of blood through the vessels.\n\n(C) The right ventricle is not involved in the flow of blood through the vessels. It is responsible for pumping blood into the aorta, but it does not directly affect the flow of blood through the vessels.\n\n(D) The arteries do not have elastic recoil. Arteries are not involved in the flow of blood through the vessels. They are responsible for carrying blood away from the heart to the rest of the body, but they do not directly affect the flow of blood through the vessels.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze each option and determine which one is true about Graves' disease of the thyroid.\n\n(A) It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia: Ophthalmoplegia is a condition where the eye muscles become weak and unable to move, which is not a direct result of Graves' disease.\n\n(B) It causes a large multi-nodular goitre: Graves' disease is characterized by the presence of a goitre, which is a swelling of the thyroid gland. However, it is not specifically described as a \"large multi-nodular goitre.\"\n\n(C) It is commoner in males than females: Graves' disease is more common in females than males, as it is a rare condition affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 women.\n\n(D) In the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck': Derbyshire Neck is a term used to describe a rare condition where the thyroid gland is enlarged and protrudes into the neck, which is not a direct result of Graves' disease.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) It is commoner in males than females",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the process of muscle contraction and relaxation.\n\nMuscle contraction occurs when the nerve stimulus is too forceful, causing the actin protein to bind to the myosin protein at the sarcomere. This binding causes the sarcomere to slide past the myosin head, which initiates the contraction.\n\nOn the other hand, muscle relaxation occurs when the nerve stimulus is removed or not strong enough, causing the actin protein to unbind from the myosin protein at the sarcomere. This unbinding allows the sarcomere to slide back to its original position, resulting in relaxation.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) The nerve stimulus being removed is the correct answer, as it is the condition that causes muscle relaxation.\n\n(B) The nerve stimulus being too forceful is incorrect, as it is the condition that causes muscle contraction.\n\n(C) The actin binding sites being uncovered is incorrect, as it is not a condition that directly causes muscle relaxation.\n\n(D) The actin binding sites being saturated is incorrect, as it is not a condition that directly causes muscle relaxation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A)",

Fatigue occurs when the body's energy resources are depleted, and it becomes difficult to maintain the level of physical activity required.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) A fall in the cell concentration of ADP: ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) is a molecule that is used as an energy source during cellular respiration. A fall in its concentration would not directly cause fatigue in high intensity exercise.\n\n(B) Inhibition of ATP production: ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) is the primary energy currency of the cell. Inhibition of ATP production can lead to a lack of energy, which can cause fatigue in high intensity exercise.\n\n(C) Failure of the ATP supply to match the demand: This option is similar to option (B). If the ATP supply is not sufficient to meet the demand for energy during high intensity exercise, fatigue can occur.\n\n(D) Lack of skill: Lack of skill is not a direct cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. It may make it more difficult to perform the exercise, but it does not directly contribute to fatigue.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise is:\n\n(B) Inhibition of ATP production.",

Increased blood volume: The increased blood volume during surgery can also cause pressure damage to the surrounding tissues.\n3. Increased blood viscosity: The increased blood viscosity during surgery can also cause pressure damage to the surrounding tissues.\n\nNow, let's calculate the time it may take for pressure damage to be visible:\n\n1.
