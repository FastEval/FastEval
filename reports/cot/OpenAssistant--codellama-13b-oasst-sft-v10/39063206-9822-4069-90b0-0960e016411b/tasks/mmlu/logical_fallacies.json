The statement is true because it is true that a reprehensible personality exists, but it is also false because it is not a valid way to define or describe a reprehensible personality. Circular reasoning occurs when a statement is both true and false at the same time, making it an invalid argument.",

In this case, the arguer is not accusing the other person of a fault or wrongdoing, but rather threatening to use force if the other person doesn't agree.\n\n(C) Ignorance of refutation: This fallacy occurs when someone claims that their argument is valid because it cannot be refuted. In this case, the arguer is not claiming that their argument is valid, but rather threatening to use force if the other person doesn't agree.\n\n(D) Straw person: This fallacy occurs when someone creates a false representation of an opponent and then uses that representation to argue against them.
