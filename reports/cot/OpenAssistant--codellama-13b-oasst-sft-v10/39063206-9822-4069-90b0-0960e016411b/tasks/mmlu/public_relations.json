            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to identify the author who emphasized strategy as achieving competitive advantage for an organization. Let's go through each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) Steyn (2003) - This option does not seem to fit the criteria, as it is a book title and not an author.\n\n(B) Gregory (2006) - This option is a possibility, as Gregory is an author who has written about strategy and competitive advantage.\n\n(C) Cutlip et al (2006) - This option is also a possibility, as Cutlip et al is a group of authors who have written about strategy and competitive advantage.\n\n(D) Henry (2006) - This option does not seem to fit the criteria, as it is a book title and not an author.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, we can conclude that both (B) Gregory (2006) and (C) Cutlip et al (2006) are potential answers. However, since the question asks for the author who emphasized strategy as achieving competitive advantage, we can assume that the answer is more likely to be a single author rather than a group of authors.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) Gregory (2006)",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the most effective form of communication for forming or changing predispositions toward an issue, we need to consider the factors that influence people's opinions and attitudes.\n\n(A) Interpersonal communication: This refers to communication between individuals, such as face-to-face conversations, phone calls, or emails. It is a direct form of communication that can help people understand each other's perspectives and build relationships. However, it may not be as effective in changing predispositions toward an issue as other forms of communication.\n\n(B) Media: Media, such as newspapers, television, and the internet, can influence people's opinions and attitudes by providing information, news, and perspectives on various issues. Media can be effective in shaping predispositions toward an issue by providing a platform for people to discuss and debate the issue, as well as by providing information that can help people make informed decisions.\n\n(C) Group communication: Group communication refers to communication within a community or organization, such as meetings, discussions, or workshops. While group communication can be effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue, it may not be as effective as other forms of communication in reaching a wide audience or in shaping public opinion.\n\n(D) Public communication: Public communication refers to communication that is intended to reach a wide audience, such as speeches, debates, or public events. Public communication can be highly effective in shaping predispositions toward an issue by providing a platform for people to discuss and debate the issue, as well as by providing information that can help people make informed decisions.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most effective form of communication for forming or changing predispositions toward an issue is (D) Public communication.",

The term \"publics\" in this context refers to the people or groups that have a role in the organization.\n\nBased on the definitions of the terms, we can see that:\n\n(A) Enabling: This term is related to providing resources or support, which can help an organization exist.\n\n(B) Functional: This term is related to the way an organization operates, which is not directly related to providing authority or assistance.\n\n(C) Normative: This term is related to the standards or guidelines that an organization follows, which is not directly related to providing authority or assistance.\n\n(D) Diffused: This term is related to the spreading of an idea or influence, which is not directly related to providing authority or assistance.\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer is:\n\n(A) Enabling",
