            "question": "What are the themes that make post-structuralism a different field of study and why is it criticized?\n\n(A) One of the founding assumptions of Critical Security Studies is that theories about the world constitute that world and thus that theory, including security theory, has political effects. The consequence is that theory is the product of the system, and that analyses of the agent of security and the referent object is produced by its own practices.\n(B) Central to the political and critical nature of post-structural literature is the idea of fostering an ethos of democracy and an ethos of critique which is finite and attainable. It is to this end that we must strive, but one that can only be met under the conditions prescribed, that of true democracy.\n(C) A central notion of critique is to provide an answer to the problem of what it means to be critical. This invariably raises the question of revealing the interest behind knowledge claims with the goal of social change, what is accepted as the end of theory: that the practical and contextual understandings inform to whom knowledge claims serve.\n(D) Poststructuralism accepts the form and foundations for knowledge claims that dominate the security studies debate. This has brought it into confrontation with the critical studies community, having little to contribute to the understanding of the ways in which knowledge is constructed.",

            "question": "Since the end of the Cold War, how has the use of coercive diplomacy by Western powers changed?\n\n(A) Coercive diplomacy has proven a successful policy tool and one that is integral to conflict management. The successes of the past policy initiatives in the post-9/11 community have reinforced the trend toward coercive diplomacy by increasing American political will to counter mass casualty terrorism in failing states.\n(B) The favourable geo-political environment, characterized by an overwhelmingly Western military superiority and a low risk of hostile great power intervention, has generated pressures and incentives for Western policymakers to promote their policy agenda, and to manage armed conflicts from weak states and failing states.\n(C) The demise of the ideological bipolar division of international society in the Cold War, rather than resulting in a reduction of hostilities, has left an unstable legacy where a policy of force and mass retaliation continues to pose a very real threat. Risk of uncontrollable escalation still remains but in a different form; mass casualty terrorism, contagion from failing states and non-state actors seeking to acquire WMD are the primary concern of states and require responses in the form of military intervention.\n(D) The hostile geopolitical environment has encouraged states to pursue military strategies in order to secure their interests. The use of violence rather than diplomacy or incentives has become the primary response to threats, whether these are posed by other states, resource scarcity, pandemic diseases, or other non-traditional threats.",

Whilst Critical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology.\n(B) Whilst Critical Security Studies regards security to be a social construction, based on the changeable ideas that form human society, the Copenhagen school disregards this epistemological approach and instead considers security as an issue to be studied objectively from a positivist approach.\n(C) Critical Security Studies regards security to be an empirically definable state, which should be studied from a positivist approach. However, the Copenhagen School views security as a socially constructed entity that denies the validity of an objective approach.\n(D) Neither Critical Security Studies nor the Copenhagen School account for the changing nature of society and its impact on the construction of security.",

            "model_answer": "The relationship between war, military security, and security studies can be explained as follows:\n\n1. War is a state of conflict between two or more parties, often involving the use of military force.\n2. Military security is the protection of a nation's military forces and assets from potential threats, such as enemy attacks or natural disasters.\n3. Security studies is the study of the various aspects of security, including political, economic, social, and military aspects.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) War is best regarded as a rational instrument of political policy; it is a continuation of politics by other means.\n- This option suggests that war is a tool used by governments to achieve their political objectives. While this is true, it does not directly address the relationship between war, military security, and security studies.\n\n(B) War is best regarded as a social aberration, and is the result of catastrophic failure in social cohesion.\n- This option suggests that war is a negative outcome of social issues, which is not directly related to the relationship between war, military security, and security studies.\n\n(C) War is an anarchic state in which state or other actors must draw upon exceptional (military) means in order to ensure the protection of their interests.\n- This option highlights the role of military force in ensuring the protection of interests during war. This is related to the relationship between war, military security, and security studies.\n\n(D) War is a state of mass conflict which is inflicted upon state actors as a result of their failure to effectively control the behaviour of their population.\n- This option suggests that war is a result of population control issues, which is not directly related to the relationship between war, military security, and security studies.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) War is an anarchic state in which state or other actors must draw upon exceptional (military) means in order to ensure the protection of their interests.",

            "question": "In what ways has the concept of environmental security been contested?\n\n(A) Analysis of environmental security is understood as the integrity of the whole ecological system whose primary threat is human activity. However, it radically challenges security thinking in that it demands a shift in the reason for action from national security interest to the welfare of the entire social-ecological system of the planet.\n(B) Environmental security contends that the principle threat to the ecological integrity is human activity and therefore humans can be secured to the extent that welfare is protected at the domestic level. The reason for action is to be found in individual and national interests.\n(C) The crossover of common insecurity issue areas is unlikely because not all problems are truly global. Not all states are equally responsible for environmental problems, nor is there such a thing as equality of risk. Systemic interdependence is unlikely to manage those security areas.\n(D) The ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security. Ecological security displays continuity with major interpretations of security, which typically centralize the security of the state.",

The IFIs focus has been on achieving human security and the promotion of development at a societal level.\n(B) Through the implementation of specific financial policies adopted at the bequest of global financial institutions, many developing countries have gained economic prosperity and the correlating levels of human security.\n(C) The World Bank and IMF tend to operate in an economic arena that includes only major financial institutions and wealthy states; coupled with a respect for sovereignty, the scope of such institutions does not reach to interference in national politics.\n(D) IFIs identified the economic failings of developing countries as being the result of political problems.
