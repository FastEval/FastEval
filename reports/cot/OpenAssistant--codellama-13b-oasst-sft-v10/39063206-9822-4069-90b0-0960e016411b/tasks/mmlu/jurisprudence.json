This aligns with Dworkin's claim that there is only one right answer to every legal question.\n\n(B) The rights of the parties feature in the determination of most cases before the courts.\nThis proposition also suggests that the rights of the parties play a role in determining cases before the courts. This aligns with Dworkin's claim that there is only one right answer to every legal question.\n\n(C) Judges exercise strong discretion.\nThis proposition suggests that judges have a lot of discretion in making decisions. This does not align with Dworkin's claim that there is only one right answer to every legal question, as it implies that there can be multiple right answers.\n\n(D) Judges seek the best 'fit' with constitutional and institutional history.\nThis proposition suggests that judges consider the historical context of the case when making decisions. This does not align with Dworkin's claim that there is only one right answer to every legal question, as it implies that there can be multiple right answers based on historical context.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most inconsistent proposition with Dworkin's claim is (C) Judges exercise strong discretion.",

This means that the defendant must show that they did not act with gross negligence or recklessness.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) The reasonable person standard varies from person to person.\nThis statement is incorrect because the reasonable person standard is a general concept that applies to all individuals, regardless of their personal beliefs or experiences.\n\n(B) The reasonable person standard focuses on the defendant's subjective mental state rather than on the defendant's behavior.\nThis statement is also incorrect because the reasonable person standard is not solely focused on the defendant's mental state. It requires the defendant to prove that they acted reasonably under the circumstances, which means considering the defendant's behavior and the circumstances.\n\n(C) A person with a physical disability must act as would a reasonable person with the same disability.\nThis statement is incorrect because the reasonable person standard does not require a person with a physical disability to act as a person without a disability. The standard is about the defendant's actions and behavior, not about the defendant's physical abilities.\n\n(D) A person with a mental disability must act as would a person with the same mental disability.\nThis statement is incorrect because the reasonable person standard does not require a person with a mental disability to act as a person without a disability.
