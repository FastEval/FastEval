Parametric statistics, on the other hand, assume that the data follows a specific distribution and use that distribution to perform statistical tests. Since the form of the distribution is not known, nonparametric statistics are more appropriate for this situation.",

This could be a possible explanation for the effects of electrical stimulation on chronic pain.\n\n(B) may produce its effects by promoting the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine\n- This option suggests that electrical stimulation of the brain may promote the release of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system. While norepinephrine is not directly related to pain regulation, it could have indirect effects on pain by affecting other neurotransmitters involved in pain regulation.\n\n(C) is generally effective, but medically ill-advised because such stimulation has aversive properties\n- This option states that electrical stimulation of the brain is generally effective, but it is medically ill-advised because it has aversive properties. This statement is contradictory, as it suggests that the stimulation is effective but also has negative consequences.\n\n(D) is of no practical significance, since stimulation-produced analgesia has been demonstrated only in rats\n- This option states that electrical stimulation of the brain is of no practical significance because it has only been demonstrated in rats. This statement is not relevant to the question, as it does not address the effects of electrical stimulation on chronic pain.\n\nBased on the analysis of the given options, the most plausible explanation for the effects of electrical stimulation of the brain for the treatment of chronic pain is:\n\n(A)",

The procedure would contribute directly to the test's validity.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each answer choice:\n\n(A) Concurrent validity: This refers to the degree to which a test measures the same construct at the same time. In this case, the test measures the same construct (machinist proficiency) in different plants.\n\n(B) Predictive validity: This refers to the degree to which a test measures the same construct in different situations. In this case, the test measures the same construct (machinist proficiency) in different plants.\n\n(C) Empirical validity: This refers to the degree to which a test measures the same construct in different samples.
