The question states that SNPs explain a small percentage of the variation in body mass index.\n2. The evidence suggests that the heritability is greater than 50%.\n3. Since the heritability is greater than 50%, it means that the SNPs explain a significant portion of the variation.\n4. The question asks for the percentage of variation explained by SNPs.\n5. The answer should be less than 1% because the heritability is greater than 50%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) less than 1%.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of inbreeding coefficient and its effects on a population.\n\nInbreeding coefficient (F) is a measure of the degree of inbreeding in a population. It is calculated by dividing the number of first-degree relatives (i.e., siblings) by the total number of individuals in the population. A higher inbreeding coefficient indicates a higher degree of inbreeding, which can lead to several negative effects on the population.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population: Inbreeding can lead to a reduction in heterozygotes, as individuals with different alleles for a given gene are more likely to mate with each other. This can result in a higher proportion of homozygotes in the population.\n\n(B) Higher proportion of genes that show linkage: Inbreeding can increase the likelihood of linkage, as more individuals with the same alleles are more likely to be found in the same generation. This can lead to a higher proportion of genes that show linkage.\n\n(C) Higher proportion of genes with introns: Inbreeding does not directly affect the presence of introns in genes. Introns are non-coding regions of a gene that are removed during transcription.\n\n(D) Higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells: Inbreeding can lead to a higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells, as the genetic variation within the population is reduced.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(A)",
