            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of optical isomerism in complexes containing achiral ligands.\n\nOptical isomerism occurs when two or more different molecules have the same molecular formula but different three-dimensional structures. In achiral complexes, the ligands are not chiral, meaning they have no defined stereochemistry. This means that the arrangement of the ligands in the complex does not affect the overall stereochemistry of the complex.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism even if the ligands are not identical. The arrangement of the ligands in the complex does not affect the overall stereochemistry.\n\n(B) Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\n\nThis statement is also incorrect. Tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism if the ligands are not identical. The arrangement of the ligands in the complex does not affect the overall stereochemistry.\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Linear complexes can display optical isomerism even if the ligands are identical. The arrangement of the ligands in the complex does not affect the overall stereochemistry.\n\n(D) Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism even if they have only two different ligands. The arrangement of the ligands in the complex does not affect the overall stereochemistry.\n\nThe correct answer is (D). Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.",
