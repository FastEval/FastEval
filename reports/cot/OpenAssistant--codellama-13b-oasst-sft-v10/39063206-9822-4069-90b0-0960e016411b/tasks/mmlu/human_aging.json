Genetics: Traits are determined by our genetic makeup, which is inherited from our parents. As a result, traits do not change with age.\n\n2. Environment: Environmental factors, such as diet, exercise, and stress, can influence the development and maintenance of traits. However, these factors do not directly cause traits to change with age.\n\n3. Hormones: Hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone, can influence the development and maintenance of traits. However, these hormones do not directly cause traits to change with age.\n\n4. Lifestyle: Lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and sedentary lifestyle, can influence the development and maintenance of traits. However, these factors do not directly cause traits to change with age.\n\n5. Aging: As we age, our bodies undergo various physiological changes that can influence the development and maintenance of traits. However, these changes are not specific to age and can also occur in younger individuals.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n(A) No",
