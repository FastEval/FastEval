            "question": "Which of the following is LEAST self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry?\n\n(A) United States\n(B) Japan\n(C) France\n(D) United Kingdom",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the following is least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. Natural resources: The amount of natural resources available in each country.\n2. Industrialization: The level of industrialization in each country.\n3. Self-sufficiency: The ability of a country to produce its own resources and meet its needs.\n\nNow let's analyze each country:\n\n(A) United States: The United States has a high level of industrialization and a large population. It has abundant natural resources, such as oil, natural gas, and minerals. However, it imports a significant amount of food and other resources.\n\n(B) Japan: Japan has a high level of industrialization and a large population. It has abundant natural resources, such as oil, natural gas, and minerals. However, it imports a significant amount of food and other resources.\n\n(C) France: France has a high level of industrialization and a large population. It has abundant natural resources, such as oil, natural gas, and minerals. However, it imports a significant amount of food and other resources.\n\n(D) United Kingdom: The United Kingdom has a high level of industrialization and a large population. It has abundant natural resources, such as oil, natural gas, and minerals. However, it imports a significant amount of food and other resources.\n\nBased on the analysis, all four countries have abundant natural resources and a high level of industrialization. However, the United Kingdom imports a larger amount of resources than the other countries. Therefore, the United Kingdom is the least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

            "question": "When a new fashion design is introduced globally, the information initially travels through a process known as\n\n(A) contagious diffusion\n(B) relocation diffusion\n(C) innovative diffusion\n(D) hierarchical diffusion",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of fashion diffusion and the different types of diffusion processes.\n\nFashion diffusion is the process by which new fashion styles and trends spread from one region to another. There are several types of fashion diffusion processes, including:\n\n1. Contagious diffusion: This is the most common type of fashion diffusion. It occurs when people in one region adopt a new fashion style and then pass it on to their friends and peers, leading to widespread adoption.\n\n2. Relocation diffusion: This occurs when people move to a new region and bring their fashion preferences with them, leading to the adoption of new styles in the new region.\n\n3. Innovative diffusion: This occurs when a new fashion style is created by a designer or designer team, and then spreads through the fashion industry.\n\n4. Hierarchical diffusion: This occurs when a fashion style is adopted by a group of influential people, such as celebrities or fashion designers, and then spreads through the fashion industry.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) contagious diffusion",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation.\n\nGunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation states that the development of one region leads to the development of another region, and this process continues until a point where the development of one region becomes self-reinforcing and the development of the other regions is no longer affected.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.\nThis statement is consistent with Myrdal's theory, as it suggests that the development of one region leads to the development of another region through trade.\n\n(B) The core will always dominate the periphery.\nThis statement is not consistent with Myrdal's theory, as it suggests that the core region will always dominate the periphery region, which contradicts the idea of cumulative causation.\n\n(C) Growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery.\nThis statement is consistent with Myrdal's theory, as it suggests that the growth and prosperity of the core region comes at the expense of the periphery region, which is a natural outcome of cumulative causation.\n\n(D) Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade.\nThis statement is consistent with Myrdal's theory, as it suggests that regions with initial advantages will continue to have advantages as they attract labor, capital, and trade, which is a natural outcome of cumulative causation.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation is:\n\n(B) The core will always dominate the periphery.",

This does not necessarily involve concentrating production activities and people in a specific location to benefit everyone.\n\n(B) Deglomeration: This term refers to the process of spreading out or dispersing something, such as people or businesses.
