The Morris Worm was the first widely known buffer overflow attack, which was discovered in 1988. It was a distributed denial-of-service attack that targeted the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) network, causing it to crash and disrupt communication.\n\nThe other options are not the first buffer overflow attack:\n\n(A) Love Bug: This was a different type of attack that targeted the Microsoft Windows operating system, not a buffer overflow attack.\n(B) SQL Slammer: This was a distributed denial-of-service attack that targeted the SQL Server database management system, not a buffer overflow attack.\n(D) Code Red: This was a distributed denial-of-service attack that targeted the Internet Information Server (IIS) web server, not a buffer overflow attack.",

This can happen when a program does not check the size of the buffer it is using and does not perform any boundary checks.\n\nIn languages like C and C++, there are no built-in functions to check the size of the buffer or perform boundary checks.

It would be impossible for services to get a TCP connection to the client web browser.\n\nWithout file descriptor passing, services would not be able to inherit the file descriptor for the TCP connection from the parent process (okd).
