            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The onset of labor is first triggered by hormones secreted by the Mother's ovaries.\n\nReasoning:\nLabor is the process of childbirth, and it is initiated by the release of hormones from the mother's body. The hormones that are responsible for initiating labor are called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are produced by the mother's ovaries and are responsible for the contractions of the uterus that lead to labor. The other options mentioned, such as the hypothalamus, adrenal gland, and placenta, do not directly cause labor.",

It does not use terms like \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour.\n\n(B) Psychoanalytic theory: This theory focuses on the unconscious mind and the role of the psyche in human behavior. It does not use terms like \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour.\n\n(C) Script theory: This theory focuses on the role of scripts (or scripts of behavior) in human behavior. It uses terms like \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour.\n\n(D) Social learning theory: This theory focuses on the transmission of behavior from one person to another through observation and imitation.

This occurs during ovulation, when the egg is released from the ovary and travels down the fallopian tube to meet the sperm.\n\nPreovulation (A) is the process of the egg being released from the ovary, but it is not the most hospitable environment for sperm passage. Proliferation (B) refers to the growth and division of cells, which is not related to sperm passage. Menstruation (D) is the process of the uterus expelling the uterine lining and blood, which is not related to sperm passage.\n\nTherefore, the most hospitable environment for sperm passage is during ovulation (C).",
