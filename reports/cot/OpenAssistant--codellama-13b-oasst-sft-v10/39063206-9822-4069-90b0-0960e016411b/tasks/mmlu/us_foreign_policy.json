            "question": "International trade will almost always benefit both countries, so why do countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market?\n\n(A) Irrationality on the part of the leadership\n(B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed\n(C) Regime type\n(D) International conflict prevents trade",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. The question asks why countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market.\n2. We know that international trade will almost always benefit both countries.\n3. This implies that countries should be open to international trade and not try to protect their own firms.\n4. Therefore, the answer must be something that explains why countries do the opposite.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) Irrationality on the part of the leadership - This option suggests that countries' leaders are irrational and do not understand the benefits of international trade.\n(B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed - This option suggests that countries are concerned about the costs of free trade but not the benefits.\n(C) Regime type - This option suggests that countries' trade policies are determined by their regime type.\n(D) International conflict prevents trade - This option suggests that countries are concerned about international conflicts and do not want to engage in trade.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most plausible answer is:\n\n(A) Irrationality on the part of the leadership",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand the main argument of the book \"The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers\" by Paul Kennedy. The book discusses the decline of the major world powers and the reasons behind it.\n\nThe book argues that the decline of the major world powers was due to a combination of factors, including low growth, inflation, and the rise of new powers like Japan. It does not argue that the United States was in decline or that the soft power of the United States would allow it to avoid decline.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) All of the world's leading economies were declining due to low growth and inflation",
