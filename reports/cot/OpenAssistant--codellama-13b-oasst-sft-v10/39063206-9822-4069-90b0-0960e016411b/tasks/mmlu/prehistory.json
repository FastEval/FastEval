            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the context of Levallois technology. Levallois technology is a type of technology that involves the production of tools and weapons by using a technique called the Levallois technique. This technique involves striking a piece of stone or other material with a hammer to create a flake, which can then be used to create more tools.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) producing core tools to producing flakes.\nThis option is incorrect because the Levallois technique is specifically about producing flakes, not core tools.\n\n(B) producing pottery to producing clothing.\nThis option is incorrect because the Levallois technique is not related to pottery or clothing production.\n\n(C) producing arrows to producing spear points.\nThis option is incorrect because the Levallois technique is not related to arrow or spear point production.\n\n(D) larger, duller axes to smaller, sharper ones.\nThis option is correct because the Levallois technique involves producing smaller, sharper tools, such as axes, by striking a piece of stone with a hammer.\n\nSo, the answer is (D).",
