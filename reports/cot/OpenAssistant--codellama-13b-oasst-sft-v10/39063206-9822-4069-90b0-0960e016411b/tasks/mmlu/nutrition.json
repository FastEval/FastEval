            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the effect of bariatric surgery on the incidence of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals.\n\nBariatric surgery is a procedure that helps obese individuals lose weight by reducing the size of their stomach. This can lead to a reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in some cases.\n\nHowever, the effect of bariatric surgery on the incidence of type 2 diabetes is not uniform across all individuals. Some studies have shown that the incidence of type 2 diabetes can be reduced by 50% or more in obese individuals who undergo bariatric surgery.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Approximately 50 %",
