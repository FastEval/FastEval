This is because the body compensates for increased environmental temperature by increasing respiration rate, which helps to release heat through the process of respiration.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

When lactate enters the circulation, it is transported to the kidneys. The kidneys then remove lactate from the blood and excrete it in the urine.

This process is carried out by enzymes called RNA polymerase, which are located in the nucleus of the cell. The nucleus is the organelle where the DNA is stored and the genetic information is encoded. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) in the nucleus.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the composition of DNA and the relationship between DNA and RNA.\n\nDNA is a double-stranded molecule, and it consists of two strands, each containing a sequence of nucleotides. The nucleotides are composed of a sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).\n\nRNA is a single-stranded molecule that serves as a template for protein synthesis. It is synthesized from the DNA template by a process called transcription. During transcription, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence, with adenine replaced by uracil (U) and thymine replaced by uridine (U).\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) variable: This option is incorrect because the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA is not variable. The ratio is always 1:1, as there are equal numbers of adenine and thymine, and equal numbers of cytosine and guanine.\n\n(B) determined by the base sequence in RNA: This option is incorrect because the base sequence in RNA is not the same as the base sequence in DNA. The RNA sequence is a complementary copy of the DNA sequence, with adenine replaced by uracil and thymine replaced by uridine.\n\n(C) genetically determined: This option is incorrect because the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA is not genetically determined. The ratio is determined by the base sequence in DNA, which is fixed and not influenced by genetic factors.\n\n(D) always 1:1: This option is correct because the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA is always 1:1. There are equal numbers of adenine and thymine, and equal numbers of cytosine and guanine.\n\nSo, the answer is (D) always 1:1.",

In this case, the student is actively relating the new information to previous knowledge and building upon it to learn advanced concepts. This process helps the student to consolidate and understand the material better.",

It is a byproduct of the breakdown of glycogen, which is stored in the liver and muscles. When the body needs energy, it breaks down glycogen to release glucose, which is then used for energy. Lactate is produced as a byproduct of this process.\n\nAs the players become more fatigued during the game, they need more energy to maintain their performance. This increased demand for energy leads to an increased production of lactate. Therefore, lactate concentration increases throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the relationship between the energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine and the duration of exercise.\n\nATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy currency of the cell, and it is broken down during exercise to produce adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). Phosphocreatine is a storage form of ATP that can be converted back to ATP during exercise.\n\nThe breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine is a slow process, and it takes time for the body to replenish the energy stores. Therefore, the duration of exercise that can be sustained depends on the rate at which ATP and phosphocreatine are broken down and replenished.\n\nThe breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine is primarily driven by the rate of oxygen consumption during exercise. The more oxygen the body uses, the more ATP and phosphocreatine are broken down.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) 1-2 seconds: This is a very short duration, and it is unlikely that the body can sustain exercise for such a short period.\n\n(B) 5-10 seconds: This is a longer duration, but it is still relatively short compared to the duration of a typical exercise session.\n\n(C) 30-40 seconds: This is a reasonable duration for sustaining exercise, as it is longer than the short durations mentioned earlier.\n\n(D) 50-60 seconds: This is a very long duration, and it is unlikely that the body can sustain exercise for such a long period.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answer is:\n\n(C) 30-40 seconds.",
