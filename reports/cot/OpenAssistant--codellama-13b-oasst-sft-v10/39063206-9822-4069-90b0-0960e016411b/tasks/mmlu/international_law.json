            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand the meaning of collective rights.\n\nCollective rights are rights that are held by a group of people as a whole, rather than by individual members of the group. These rights are typically granted to protect the interests of the group as a whole, and may include things like the right to organize, negotiate, or bargain collectively.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) Collective rights belong to distinct groups of people - This is true, as collective rights are rights held by a group of people as a whole.\n\n(B) Collective rights are those that belong to particular groups as opposed to the individual members of the group - This is also true, as collective rights are rights held by a group as a whole, rather than by individual members of the group.\n\n(C) Minority rights are collective rights - This is not true, as minority rights are rights granted to a specific group or minority, rather than collective rights.\n\n(D) Collective rights entail a right of the group as such as well as individual rights of the group's members - This is also true, as collective rights include both the rights of the group as a whole and the individual rights of the group's members.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Collective rights entail a right of the group as such as well as individual rights of the group's members",

This means that both types of law are considered to be part of the same system and should be treated as such.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that monism believes that there is a single, unified legal order that encompasses both international and domestic law. This means that the principles and rules of international law should be applied to domestic law as well, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Monism posits that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order",

            "model_answer": "To determine which case best illustrates the 'living instrument principle' used by the European Court of Human Rights, we need to analyze the cases and their relevance to the principle.\n\nThe 'living instrument principle' states that a treaty or convention must be interpreted in a way that is consistent with its purpose and the evolving needs of the society it is intended to serve. This principle is important because it ensures that treaties and conventions remain relevant and effective in the face of changing circumstances.\n\nNow let's analyze each case:\n\n(A) Golder v UK (1978) - This case is about the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is a treaty that establishes the rights of individuals within the European Union. The Court held that the Convention must be interpreted in a way that is consistent with its purpose and the evolving needs of the society it is intended to serve. This case is relevant to the 'living instrument principle' because it demonstrates the Court's commitment to ensuring that the Convention remains relevant and effective.\n\n(B) A v UK (2009) - This case is about the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to the right to privacy. The Court held that the Convention must be interpreted in a way that is consistent with its purpose and the evolving needs of the society it is intended to serve. This case is also relevant to the 'living instrument principle' because it demonstrates the Court's commitment to ensuring that the Convention remains relevant and effective.\n\n(C) Goodwin v UK (2002) - This case is about the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to the right to freedom of expression. The Court held that the Convention must be interpreted in a way that is consistent with its purpose and the evolving needs of the society it is intended to serve. This case is also relevant to the 'living instrument principle' because it demonstrates the Court's commitment to ensuring that the Convention remains relevant and effective.\n\n(D) Osman v UK (1998) - This case is about the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. The Court held that the Convention must be interpreted in a way that is consistent with its purpose and the evolving needs of the society it is intended to serve. This case is also relevant to the 'living instrument principle' because it demonstrates the Court's commitment to ensuring that the Convention remains relevant and effective.\n\nBased on the analysis, all four cases are relevant to the 'living instrument principle' used by the European Court of Human Rights. However, since we are asked to choose the best illustration, we can choose any of the cases.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

This was to ensure that the disputes were handled in a fair and impartial manner.\n\nStep 2: The Commission required a change in boundaries\nThe Commission also insisted on the need for a change in the boundaries of the former Yugoslav republics.
