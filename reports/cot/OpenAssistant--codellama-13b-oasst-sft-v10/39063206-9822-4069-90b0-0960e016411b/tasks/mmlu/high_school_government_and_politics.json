            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) Appellate judges never use the stare decisis principle.\n- The stare decisis principle is a legal principle that requires courts to follow the precedent set by previous decisions. Appellate courts are courts of appeal, and they do use the stare decisis principle to determine the correct interpretation of the law.\n\n(B) Appellate trials are usually jury trials.\n- Appellate courts do not hold trials. They review the decisions of lower courts and determine whether the lower court's decision is correct or incorrect. Appellate trials are not jury trials.\n\n(C) Appellate judges usually decide the facts of a case.\n- Appellate judges do not decide the facts of a case. Their role is to review the lower court's decision and determine whether it is correct or incorrect. They do not decide the facts of a case.\n\n(D) Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts.\n- This is true. Appellate judges review the decisions of lower courts and determine whether the lower court's decision is correct or incorrect.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the correct answer is (D).",
