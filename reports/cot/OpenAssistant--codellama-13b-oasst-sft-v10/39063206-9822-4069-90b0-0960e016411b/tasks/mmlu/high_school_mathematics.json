            "model_answer": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles.\n2. The two piles had an equal number of pins.\n3. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.\n4. John had 66 pins left.\n\nLet's denote the number of pins in one pile as x. Since the two piles have an equal number of pins, we can write:\n\nx = 2 * 66\n\nNow, we know that John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. Let's denote the number of pins his brother received as y. We can write:\n\ny = (1/3) * (1/2) * x\n\nNow, we know that John had 66 pins left. We can write:\n\nx - y = 66\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\nx = 2 * 66\ny = (1/3) * (1/2) * x\nx - y = 66\n\nWe can solve these equations step-by-step:\n\n1. Substitute the first equation into the second equation:\n\ny = (1/3) * (1/2) * (2 * 66)\n\n2. Simplify the equation:\n\ny = (1/3) * (1/2) * 132\n\n3. Simplify the equation:\n\ny = (1/6) * 132\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n\ny = 22\n\n5. Substitute the value of y into the third equation:\n\n(2 * 66) - 22 = 66\n\n6. Simplify the equation:\n\n132 - 22 = 110\n\n7. Simplify the equation:\n\nx = 110\n\nNow we know that John originally had 110 pins.\n\nThe answer is (B) 66.",
