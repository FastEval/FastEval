            "model_answer": "Induction heating takes place in conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magnetic materials.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that induction heating involves the generation of heat through the electromagnetic induction of current in a conductor. This process requires the presence of a conductor, which can be made of any material that can conduct electricity. Conducting materials can be either magnetic or non-magnetic, and in the case of magnetic materials, the induction heating process can be further enhanced by the presence of a magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B).",

This is because the high frequency of the electromagnetic forces causes the molten metal to vibrate and move around, which can lead to inefficiencies and poor heat distribution.\n\nB) Magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuit is poor. This is because the high frequency of the electromagnetic forces causes the magnetic fields to be weak and unstable, making it difficult for the primary and secondary circuits to effectively transfer energy.\n\nCombining both A and B, low frequency supply is necessary to reduce the stirring action in the molten metal and improve the magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuits, resulting in more efficient heat transfer and better overall performance.",
