            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the relationship between GDP (Gross Domestic Product), GI (Gross Investment), and P (Purchases).\n\nGDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a given period of time. It is a measure of the country's economic activity.\n\nGI is the total value of all investments made by a country in the production of goods and services. It is a measure of the country's investment in its economy.\n\nP is the total value of all purchases made by a country in the production of goods and services. It is a measure of the country's consumption of goods and services.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statement:\n\n\"If XYZ Corporation buys an original Matisse painting to hang in its board room then\"\n\nThis statement tells us that XYZ Corporation has made a purchase of an original Matisse painting.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) GDP decreases by the amount of the purchase because C decreases.\n(B) GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases.\n(C) GDP is unaffected because it is a second hand sale.\n(D) GI)P decreases because I decreases.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the purchase of an original Matisse painting is not a decrease in consumption (C).\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because the purchase of an original Matisse painting is not an increase in investment (I).\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because the purchase of an original Matisse painting is not a second hand sale.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the purchase of an original Matisse painting is not a decrease in investment (I).\n\nTherefore, none of the given options are correct.",

A surplus in net taxes is not the same as a surplus in gross taxes, which would mean more money going out than coming in.\n5. A surplus in net taxes is not the same as a trade surplus, which is a surplus in trade balance.\n6.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The best example of a negative supply shock to the economy would be (D) unexpectedly higher resource prices.\n\nReasoning:\nA negative supply shock refers to a situation where the supply of goods or services in the economy decreases, which can lead to a decrease in the overall demand for those goods or services. In this case, the supply shock is caused by an increase in the price of resources, which can make it more expensive for businesses to produce goods and services. This can lead to a decrease in the overall demand for those goods or services, which can have a negative impact on the economy.\n\nOn the other hand, options (A), (B), and (C) are not negative supply shocks because they do not decrease the supply of goods or services in the economy. Instead, they either increase government spending, decrease the real interest rate, or increase the money supply, which can lead to an increase in the demand for goods and services, not a decrease.",

A recession can be considered a severe depression, but not all severe depressions are recessions.\n\n(C) are marked by a sustained decline in output.\nThis statement is correct. A recession is characterized by a sustained decline in output, which means a decrease in the production of goods and services.\n\n(D) are regular occurrences in capitalist economies.\nThis statement is also correct.

It is a key indicator of an economy's overall health and growth.\n\nPrices are the cost of goods and services in an economy. When GDP increases, it means that the economy is growing and producing more goods and services. As a result, prices should also increase to reflect the higher value of goods and services produced.\n\nEmployment is the number of people who are working in an economy. If GDP is increasing, it means that there is more production and more goods and services being produced. As a result, there should be more jobs available, and employment should increase.\n\nProduction is the process of creating goods and services in an economy.

            "model_answer": "The \"crowding-out\" effect is the result of increasing interest rates from expansionary monetary policy.\n\nReasoning:\n\nCrowding-out refers to the phenomenon where an increase in one variable (in this case, interest rates) leads to a decrease in another variable (usually, output or employment). This occurs because the increase in interest rates reduces the amount of money available for investment, which in turn reduces the amount of resources allocated to production and employment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because decreasing interest rates from contractionary fiscal policy would actually lead to an increase in output and employment, not crowding-out.\n\nOption B is incorrect because increasing interest rates from expansionary fiscal policy would not necessarily lead to crowding-out, as it would not directly affect the amount of money available for investment.\n\nOption C is incorrect because increasing interest rates from expansionary monetary policy would lead to crowding-out, as it would reduce the amount of money available for investment and thus reduce output and employment.\n\nOption D is incorrect because increasing unemployment rates from expansionary monetary policy would not necessarily lead to crowding-out, as it would not directly affect the amount of money available for investment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) increasing interest rates from expansionary monetary policy.",
