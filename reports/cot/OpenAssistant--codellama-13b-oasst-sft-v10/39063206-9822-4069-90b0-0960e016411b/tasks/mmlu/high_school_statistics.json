In order to use \u03c72 procedures, you must have at least 2 degrees of freedom.\nIII. In a 4 \u00d7 2 two-way table, the number of degrees of freedom is 3.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. This statement is true because the expected value for each cell in a \u03c72 table must be at least 5. This is a requirement for the \u03c72 test to be valid.\n\nII. This statement is true because the \u03c72 test requires at least 2 degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom are the number of independent variables in the model. In a two-way table, there are two independent variables, so the minimum number of degrees of freedom is 2.\n\nIII.
