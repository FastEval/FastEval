            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of a bilateral cleft palate. A bilateral cleft palate is a congenital defect in which the two halves of the palate do not fuse properly during development.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) palatine processes: The palatine processes are the bones that form the roof of the mouth. They are involved in the fusion process, so this option is not correct.\n\n(B) palatine and frontonasal processes: The frontonasal processes are the bones that form the front part of the palate. They are also involved in the fusion process, so this option is not correct.\n\n(C) palatine, frontonasal, and secondary nasal processes: The secondary nasal processes are the bones that form the back part of the palate. They are also involved in the fusion process, so this option is not correct.\n\n(D) palatine, frontonasal, secondary nasal processes, and mandibular processes: The mandibular processes are the bones that form the jaw. They are not involved in the fusion process, so this option is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",
