            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Next generation sequencing (NGS) is most often used to identify a newly discovered virus (A).\n\nReasoning:\nNGS is a technique used to sequence large amounts of DNA or RNA from a sample, allowing for the analysis of genetic information. It is commonly used in the field of molecular biology and genetics to study the genetic makeup of organisms, including viruses. Identifying a newly discovered virus is a primary application of NGS, as it allows researchers to study the genetic makeup of a previously unknown virus and gain insights into its behavior and potential impact on human health.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for (D) Effect modification (interaction).\n\nReasoning:\n\nRandomization helps to control for effect modification (interaction) because it ensures that subjects are assigned to treatment groups randomly, reducing the likelihood of confounding variables influencing the results. This helps to eliminate the possibility of the treatment group receiving a different treatment than the control group, which could lead to an interaction effect.\n\nPlacebo effect (A) is not controlled for by randomization, as it is a natural phenomenon that occurs when subjects receive a placebo and expect it to be effective.\n\nRecall bias (B) is not controlled for by randomization, as it is a type of selection bias that occurs when subjects are asked to recall their experiences with a treatment, which can lead to recalling positive experiences and overestimating the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nNon-compliance (C) is not controlled for by randomization, as it is a type of selection bias that occurs when subjects do not follow the study protocol or complete the study as intended.",
