The term \"embourgeoisement\" refers to the process of the working class becoming more like the middle class in terms of social status and lifestyle.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because it suggests that capitalists are being replaced by salaried managers with bureaucratic authority, which is not consistent with the embourgeoisement thesis.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because it suggests that the affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life, which is not consistent with the embourgeoisement thesis, which focuses on the middle class becoming more dominant.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because it suggests that the class structure has fragmented and there are no longer any distinct social classes, which is not consistent with the embourgeoisement thesis, which focuses on the middle class becoming more dominant.\n\nOption (C) is the correct answer because it suggests that white-collar occupations are being 'deskilled' by the introduction of new technologies into the workplace, which is consistent with the embourgeoisement thesis, as it highlights the increasing influence of capitalism and the rise of white-collar occupations.",
