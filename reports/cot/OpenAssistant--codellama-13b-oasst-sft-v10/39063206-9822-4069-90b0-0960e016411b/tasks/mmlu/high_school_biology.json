            "model_answer": "To perform a polymerase chain reaction (P CR) on a DNA sample, the following are required:\n\n1. Reverse transcriptase (A): This enzyme is used to reverse transcribe the DNA sample into RNA, which is then used as a template for the polymerase chain reaction.\n\n2. Primers complementary to certain portions of the DNA (C): These are specific sequences of DNA that are complementary to the target region of the DNA sample. They serve as the starting point for the polymerase chain reaction.\n\n3. DNA ligase (D): This enzyme is used to ligate the two strands of the DNA sample together during the polymerase chain reaction.\n\n4. A vacuum chamber (B): This is used to maintain a low pressure environment during the reaction, which is necessary for the efficient formation of the DNA strands.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) Reverse transcriptase.",

In DNA replication, errors are detected and corrected during the process, which helps maintain the integrity of the genetic material. In RNA viral replication, there is no such mechanism to detect and correct errors, which increases the likelihood of mutations occurring.",

If it has one copy of the B gene and one copy of the b gene, it will also have brown fur.\n\nThe silver fur gene (b) is recessive, meaning that if a mink has two copies of the b gene, it will have silver fur. If it has one copy of the B gene and one copy of the b gene, it will have brown fur.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) BB BB - This genotype has two copies of the B gene and two copies of the b gene. Since the B gene is dominant, the mink will have brown fur.\n\n(B) BB Bb - This genotype has two copies of the B gene and one copy of the b gene.

This change can be driven by various factors, such as natural selection, sexual selection, and artificial selection.\n\nNatural selection is the process by which individuals with traits that are advantageous in their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to their offspring. This leads to the gradual change in the population's traits over time.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) Artificial selection: This is a term used to describe the process of selecting individuals with specific traits for a specific purpose, such as breeding or experimentation. It is not related to the gradual change in the size of horses over time.\n\n(B) Directional selection: This term refers to the process of selecting individuals with traits that are advantageous in a particular direction, such as increasing or decreasing a specific trait.
