Air resistance is not negligible.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the statements\nI. The ball's speed is zero at the highest point.\nII. The ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point.\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the statements\nI. The ball's speed is not zero at the highest point because it is moving upwards due to the force of the toss.\nII. The ball's acceleration is not zero at the highest point because it is experiencing a force due to gravity and air resistance.\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down because it is experiencing air resistance, which slows it down.\n\nStep 4: Determine the correct answer\nThe correct answer is (C) I & II only.",

It is not directly measured using the slope of the graph.\n\n(C) Velocity: Velocity is the rate of change of position with respect to time. It is not directly measured using the slope of the graph.\n\n(D) Inertial mass: Inertial mass is the mass of an object that is not affected by external forces. It is directly measured using the slope of the graph. The slope of the graph represents the ratio of the object's acceleration to its net force, which is the same as the ratio of its inertial mass to its gravitational mass.\n\nTherefore, the quantity directly measured using the slope of the graph is (D) Inertial mass.",
