Rob finished below Joe.\nOptions:\n(A) Ana finished third\n(B) Eve finished third\n(C) Ada finished third\n(D) Dan finished third\n(E) Rob finished third\n(F) Amy finished third\n(G) Joe finished third",
            "correct_answer": "(D)",
            "model_answer": "1. Dan finished third.\n2. Ana finished above Ada.\n3. Amy finished last.\n4. Dan finished below Rob.\n5. Eve finished below Ada.\n6. Rob finished below Joe.\n\nUsing statement 1, we know that Dan didn't finish first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh. That leaves only third place for Dan.\n\nUsing statement 2, Ana finished either first or second. But we know from statement 1 that Dan finished third. So Ana didn't finish third, which means she finished first or second. \n\nUsing statement 3, we know that Amy finished seventh.\n\nUsing statement 4, we know that Dan finished behind Rob, who didn't finish seventh. So Rob finished either first, second, or sixth.\n\nUsing statement 5, we know that Eve finished either third, fourth, fifth, or sixth. But we know from statement 2 that Ana finished above Ada, so Ada finished either sixth or seventh. If Eve finished below Ada, then Eve can only finish fifth or sixth. If Rob finished first or second, then Eve can only finish fifth. If Rob finished sixth, then Eve can finish fifth or sixth. \n\nUsing statement 6, we know that Rob finished either first, second, or sixth, and that Joe finished first or second. If Rob finished first and Joe finished second, then Eve would have to finish fifth and Ada would have to finish sixth. But we know from statement 2 that Ana finished above Ada, so this is not possible. If Rob finished second and Joe finished first, then Eve would have to finish sixth and Ada would have to finish fifth. But we know from statement 5 that Eve finished below Ada, so this is not possible. Therefore, Rob finished sixth and Joe finished first. \n\nSo the final order from first to last is: Joe, Rob, Dan, Ana, Eve, Ada, Amy. Therefore, the answer is (E) Rob finished third.",
