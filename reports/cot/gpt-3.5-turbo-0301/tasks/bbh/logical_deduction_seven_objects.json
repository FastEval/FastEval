In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Ana, Eve, Ada, Dan, Rob, Amy, and Joe. Dan finished third. Ana finished above Ada. Amy finished last. Dan finished below Rob. Eve finished below Ada. Rob finished below Joe.\nOptions:\n(A) Ana finished third\n(B) Eve finished third\n(C) Ada finished third\n(D) Dan finished third\n(E) Rob finished third\n(F) Amy finished third\n(G) Joe finished third",

            "model_answer": "1. Dan finished third.\n2. Ana finished above Ada.\n3. Amy finished last.\n4. Dan finished below Rob.\n5. Eve finished below Ada.\n6. Rob finished below Joe.\n\nWe know that Dan finished third and Rob finished below him, so Rob must have finished either fourth, fifth, or sixth. However, we also know that Rob finished below Joe, which means Joe must have finished first or second. If Joe finished first, then Ada, Eve, and Ana must have finished in some order of second, fourth, and fifth. But that would mean Amy finished sixth, which is not consistent with the fact that she finished last. Therefore, Joe finished second and Ada, Eve, and Ana finished in some order of first, fourth, and fifth. Since Ana finished above Ada, Ada must have finished fourth and Eve must have finished first. This leaves Ana in fifth and Amy in seventh.\n\nAnswer: (B) Eve finished third.",

            "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a bus, a motorcyle, a hatchback, a station wagon, a minivan, a truck, and a limousine. The station wagon is the fourth-newest. The motorcyle is newer than the truck. The station wagon is older than the hatchback. The minivan is newer than the hatchback. The bus is newer than the minivan.

            "model_answer": "1. The station wagon is the fourth-newest.\n2. The motorcyle is newer than the truck.\n3. The station wagon is older than the hatchback.\n4. The minivan is newer than the hatchback.\n5. The bus is newer than the minivan.\n6. The truck is newer than the limousine.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the station wagon is older than three other vehicles. And from statement 3, we know that the station wagon is older than the hatchback. Therefore, the hatchback must be one of the three vehicles older than the station wagon. \n\nUsing statement 4, we know that the minivan is newer than the hatchback. Therefore, the minivan cannot be one of the three vehicles older than the station wagon. \n\nUsing statement 5, we know that the bus is newer than the minivan. Therefore, the bus cannot be one of the three vehicles older than the station wagon. \n\nUsing statement 2, we know that the motorcyle is newer than the truck. Therefore, the truck must be one of the three vehicles older than the station wagon. \n\nUsing statement 6, we know that the limousine is newer than the truck. Therefore, the limousine cannot be one of the three vehicles older than the station wagon. \n\nTherefore, the only three vehicles left to be considered are the hatchback, the minivan, and the truck. And from the previous analysis, we know that the hatchback must be the oldest of these three, the minivan cannot be the third-oldest, and the truck must be one of the three oldest. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (F) The truck is the third-oldest.",
