Since there are seven birds, the third from the right means that the blue jay is in the fifth position from the left.\n3. Use the statement \"The cardinal is the leftmost\" to determine the position of the cardinal. Since the cardinal is on the leftmost side, it must be in the first position from the left.\n4. Use the statement \"The hummingbird is the fourth from the left\" to determine the position of the hummingbird.

Use the statement \"The quail is to the right of the crow\" to determine the position of the crow and the quail. Since the quail is to the right of the crow, there are only two possible orders for the crow, quail, and robin: crow - quail - robin or robin - quail - crow.

So, the only possible position for the gray book is the third position, and the only possible positions for the white book is the seventh position.\n2. The orange book is the second from the left and the black book is to the right of the yellow book. Therefore, the only possible positions for the orange book and the yellow book are positions two and four respectively.\n3. The black book is the third from the left, so the only possible positions for the black book are positions three and six.\n4. The green book is to the left of the gray book. Therefore, the only available positions for the green book are positions one and two.\n\nNow, we know that the possible positions for each book are:\n- White book: position 7 \n- Gray book: position 3\n- Orange book: position 2 \n- Yellow book: position 4 \n- Black book: positions 3 and 6 \n- Green book: positions 1 and 2 \n- Purple book: unknown\n\nThe only way to satisfy all the given conditions is if the black book is in position 6 and the green book is in position 1. This would make the yellow book position 4, gray book position 3, orange book position 2, white book position 7, and leave the purple book in position 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) the yellow book is the second from the right.",

Since the black book is already in position 2, the green book cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the green book must be either in position 1 or position 3. \n\nUsing statement 5, we know that the green book is also to the right of the orange book. Since the green book cannot be in position 2, it must be in position 3, and therefore the orange book must be in position 2. \n\nUsing statement 3, we know that the brown book is to the right of the yellow book. Since the black book is already in position 2, the yellow book must be in position 1.
