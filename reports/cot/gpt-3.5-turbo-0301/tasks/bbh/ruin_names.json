Option B, \"rains man,\" does not really change the meaning of the original title, and therefore cannot confer humor due to the substitution of \"rains\" for \"rain.\" Option C, \"rain men,\" is a more promising answer, as it not only pluralizes the titular character but also emphasizes the possible absurdity of multiple \"Rain Men\" existing in the world. Finally, option D, \"rainmman,\" is simply a misspelling and therefore not a humorous alteration of the original title. Therefore, the answer is (C) rain men.",

This one is interesting since it replaces the 'p' with 'g', resulting in a new and unusual word.
