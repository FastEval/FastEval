            "model_answer": "To find a movie similar to Batman, The Mask, The Fugitive, and Pretty Woman, we need to determine the common theme or genre among these movies. Batman and The Mask are both superhero movies, while The Fugitive and Pretty Woman are both thrillers. However, all four movies have a strong sense of action and adventure. With this in mind, we can eliminate The Front Page and The Lion King, as both are comedies and dramas, respectively. Maelstrom and Lamerica are both dramas, but they do not have a similar sense of action and adventure as the four original movies. Therefore, the answer is (D) Lamerica.",

            "model_answer": "To find a movie similar to The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, Forrest Gump, and The Shawshank Redemption, we need to look for movies that have elements of mystery, physics/philosophy, historical events, and prison. \nOption A, Street Fighter II The Animated Movie, does not fit any of these criteria. \nOption B, The Sheltering Sky, has elements of travel and cultural exploration, but doesn't fit the specific criteria we're looking for. \nOption C, The Boy Who Could Fly, has a fantasy element, but doesn't have any of the specific elements we're looking for. \nOption D, Terminator 2 Judgment Day, has elements of physics and philosophy with the concept of time travel and artificial intelligence, and also has the setting of a prison. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Terminator 2 Judgment Day.",
