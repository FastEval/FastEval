Each instruction is represented by one letter and possibly followed by one or more parameters. The \"M\" command moves the pen to the coordinates specified by the coordinates (x,y) and sets the starting point for a new subpath, while the \"L\" command draws a line from the current point to the point specified by (x,y). \n\nStarting at point (64.00, 63.00), the path draws a line to point (44.00, 63.00), then to (44.00, 50.00), then to (64.00, 50.00), then to (64.00, 45.00), then to (85.00, 57.00), then to (64.00, 68.00), and finally back to (64.00, 63.00). \n\nThe resulting shape consists of four sides of equal length, and two sides of different lengths connecting at a right angle. This shape is a (H) rectangle. \n\nAnswer: H",
