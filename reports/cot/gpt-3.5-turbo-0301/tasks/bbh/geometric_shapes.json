Each pair represents a point on the path, and the path element moves from point to point following a certain pattern. In this case, the path starts at point (55.57, 80.69), moves to point (57.38, 65.80), and continues through several more points before ending back at the starting point. However, all of the points are connected by lines, so the SVG path element draws a (E) line.",
