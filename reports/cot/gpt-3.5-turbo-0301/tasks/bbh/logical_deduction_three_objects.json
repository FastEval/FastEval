The blue jay is to the right of the hummingbird, so the order must be hummingbird, blue jay, raven. We are asked which bird is the rightmost, meaning furthest to the right. Since the raven is already in the middle, it cannot be the rightmost. The blue jay is to the right of the hummingbird, so it cannot be the rightmost either.
