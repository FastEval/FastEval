            "question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "correct_answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18",
            "model_answer": "The number of eggs Janet has available to sell every day is the total number of eggs her ducks lay minus the number she eats for breakfast and the number she uses for baking muffins. That is:\n16 - 3 - 4 = 9\nSo she has 9 fresh duck eggs available for sale every day.\n\nShe sells each egg for $2, so the total amount of money she makes every day at the farmers' market is:\n9 x $2 = $18\n\nTherefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "correct_answer": "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3",
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Start by finding out how much white fiber the robe takes. We know it takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. If it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the white fiber will be 1 bolt.\n\nStep 2: Add the amount of blue and white fiber needed. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber, for a total of 3 bolts.\n\nAnswer: 3",
