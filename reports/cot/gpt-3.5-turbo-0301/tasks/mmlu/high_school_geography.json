            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Subsistence economies are those that focus on producing enough food and basic necessities to survive, rather than producing for trade and the market. In such economies, the main goal is to meet the basic needs of the individual or family, rather than generating wealth. \n\nOption A, a currency, is not necessarily a requirement for subsistence economies, as a barter system can be used instead. \n\nOption B, a well-connected transportation infrastructure, would certainly help in accessing markets and expanding trade, but is not the main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically. \n\nOption C, government activity, can actually hinder economic advancement in some cases, as government regulations and restrictions may limit entrepreneurial activity. \n\nOption D, a banking service, is often crucial for economic advancement as it allows for savings, loans, and investments. Without access to banking services, it is difficult to accumulate wealth or expand businesses.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) a banking service.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The term \"replacement fertility\" refers to the level of fertility at which each woman has only enough children to replace herself and her partner, resulting in a stable population size. If a population continues to grow beyond this level, it is experiencing demographic momentum, which is caused by a relatively high proportion of individuals in the childbearing ages and a delay in the effect of declining fertility rates on population growth. Therefore, the answer is (D) demographic momentum.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "When people consider leaving their home to migrate to a new location, they often weigh the benefits of the new location against the costs and difficulties of leaving their current residence. Often, the benefit of the new location is related to job opportunities, access to resources, and other factors that will make life easier or more fulfilling. \n\nHowever, as the distance between the current residence and the potential new location increases, the costs and difficulties of moving also increase. People may be reluctant to leave their current home if it is too far away from the new location, especially if they have ties to the community and family members nearby. This tendency for migration to decrease with distance is known as distance decay.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) distance decay.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements is TRUE concerning women in the labor force?\n\n(A) Most women work in agriculture\n(B) The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide\n(C) The percentage of women in the total labor force declined\n(D) Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Let's first analyze statement (A) - \"Most women work in agriculture\". This statement may or may not be true, but we cannot say for certain without data or context. However, we do know that this statement is not universally true worldwide, as women's labor force participation varies greatly by region and industry.\n\nStep 2: Now, let's move on to statement (B) - \"The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide\". This statement is true. According to data from the International Labour Organization, the global labor force participation rate for women decreased slightly from 49.6% in 2005 to 47.4% in 2020. This decline is thought to be due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes, economic crises, and cultural and social barriers.\n\nStep 3: Next, we examine statement (C) - \"The percentage of women in the total labor force declined\". This statement is false. While the proportion of women in the labor force may have decreased in certain regions or industries, the overall number of women in the labor force has increased over time. This is due to factors such as population growth, increasing education levels for women, and changes in social norms and policies.\n\nStep 4: Finally, we consider statement (D) - \"Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia\". This statement is false. According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, women on average work fewer hours per day than men in all OECD countries, including Anglo America (which includes the United States and Canada) and Australia. The gender gap in hours worked tends to be largest in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and smallest in Scandinavia and some Western European countries.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question.\nThe question is asking us to identify which of the four factors listed is not considered a pull factor for migration.\n\nStep 2: Define pull factor.\nA pull factor is something that attracts people to a new location, such as job opportunities, education, or a better quality of life.\n\nStep 3: Analyze each option.\nOption A: Safety - Safety can be a pull factor for migration, especially if people are leaving a dangerous or unstable area for a safer one.\nOption B: Better Climate - Climate can also be a pull factor for migration, as people may want to move to a location with a more desirable climate.\nOption C: Better Schools - Education is often cited as a pull factor for migration among families who want their children to have access to better schools.\nOption D: Overcrowding - Overcrowding is not typically considered a pull factor for migration. In fact, it is more likely to be a push factor, as people may leave an overcrowded area in search of more space.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer.\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that option D (overcrowding) is not considered a pull factor for migration.\n\nAnswer: D",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand what a relict boundary is. A relict boundary is a former boundary that still has political or cultural meaning even though the physical boundary no longer exists. \n\nNext, we need to determine which of the countries listed has a well-known example of a relict boundary. \n\nStarting with (A) Vietnam, Vietnam does have an example of a relict boundary - the DMZ (demilitarized zone) that once divided North and South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. \n\nMoving on to (B) United Kingdom, the United Kingdom also has an example of a relict boundary - Hadrian's Wall, which marked the northernmost boundary of the Roman Empire in Britain. \n\nGoing to (C) Germany, Germany has several examples of relict boundaries, such as the Berlin Wall, which divided East and West Berlin during the Cold War, and the former inner German border, which separated East and West Germany. \n\nFinally, we come to (D) Bolivia. While Bolivia has a number of important boundaries, including borders with Brazil, Peru, and Chile, there is not a well-known example of a relict boundary in Bolivia. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Bolivia.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Farm workers from another country are most likely to be practicing circular migration during the year. This is because circular migration involves the repeated movement of individuals between two or more countries, typically for work purposes. As farm work is often seasonal, it makes sense that workers would engage in circular migration to work on farms during the growing season and return to their home country during the off-season. Therefore, the answer is (C) Circular migration.",

            "model_answer": "Centrifugal forces are typically those that pull a country apart or create divisions within it. \n\n(A) Religious differences can certainly create divisions within a country, as different groups may hold opposing views on important issues and struggle for power.\n\n(B) A national holiday is unlikely to be a centrifugal force, as it is typically a unifying event that brings people together to celebrate a common cultural tradition or historical event.\n\n(C) An attack by another country could potentially create a sense of national defense and unity, rather than a centrifugal force.\n\n(D) A charismatic national leader could also potentially have a unifying effect on a country, as they may be able to bring people together and rally them around a common cause or vision. However, if their leadership is divisive or controversial, it could potentially create centrifugal forces within the country.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Religious differences.",
