            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Subsistence economies are based on the idea of producing enough for survival, with little or no surplus. To advance economically, they need to be able to produce more than just enough, which requires being able to sell the surplus. This requires some sort of exchange mechanism, which is typically provided by a currency. Therefore, the main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically is the lack of (A) a currency.",

            "model_answer": "When people migrate, they are often influenced by factors that either push them away from their current location or pull them toward a new location. However, distance can also play a role in migration patterns. As distance increases, it becomes increasingly difficult for people to move to a new location due to various barriers such as transportation costs and cultural differences.\n\nTherefore, the tendency for migration to decrease with distance is called (C) distance decay.",

            "model_answer": "Burgess's concentric zone model of urban form suggests that cities have concentric zones, each with different characteristics. The outermost zone is characterized by newer housing, middle-class families, and suburbanization.

The zone that contains low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration is the third zone, which is also known as the \"Zone of Transition.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Third.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Let's start by analyzing statement (A) - \"Most women work in agriculture\". This statement seems unlikely to be true since in many countries women have moved away from agricultural work and into other sectors. Moreover, the question refers to \"women in the labor force\" indicating that we are talking about women who are economically active. Thus, we can eliminate option (A). \n\nStep 2: Moving on to statement (B) - \"The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide\". This statement is also unlikely to be true since there has been a trend of increasing participation by women in the labor force in many countries over the years. Hence, we can eliminate option (B). \n\nStep 3: Let's analyze statement (C) - \"The percentage of women in the total labor force declined\". It is possible that the percentage of women in the total labor force declined if the number of men in the labor force increased at a higher rate. However, without any further context or data, it is difficult to determine the veracity of this statement. Therefore, we cannot eliminate option (C) yet. \n\nStep 4: Finally, we come to statement (D) - \"Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia\". This statement seems plausible since there have been studies showing that women work longer hours than men in many countries. Moreover, the exception of Anglo America and Australia may be due to the fact that these regions have enacted policies to promote work-family balance. Therefore, we will select option (D) as the correct answer. \n\nAnswer: D",

People might choose to migrate to a place where they feel safer, especially if they are facing violence or persecution in their home country.\n\n(B) Better climate can also be a pull factor, especially if the person's home country has extreme weather conditions or a harsh climate.\n\n(C) Better schools can be a significant pull factor for families who are seeking better opportunities and education for their children. \n\n(D) Overcrowding is a push factor rather than a pull factor. Overcrowding can make living conditions unbearable and might lead people to seek a new place to live. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

            "model_answer": "Relict boundaries are boundaries that no longer have any current political function but still exist as reminders of past events. \n\nVietnam was once divided into two countries, North and South Vietnam, with a clear boundary between them. After the Vietnam War, the two countries were reunited and the boundary between them became a relict boundary. So Vietnam has a well-known example of a relict boundary.\n\nThe United Kingdom has several examples of relict boundaries, including the old city walls of York and the Antonine Wall, which marked the northern boundary of the Roman Empire in Britain.\n\nGermany also has a well-known example of a relict boundary, namely the Berlin Wall, which separated East and West Berlin during the Cold War. Although the Berlin Wall no longer exists, parts of it have been preserved as a reminder of the country's division.\n\nBolivia does not have a well-known example of a relict boundary. While the country has had several boundary disputes with neighboring countries, resulting in the recognition of new boundaries, there is no known example of a former boundary that still exists as a relict boundary.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Bolivia.",

            "model_answer": "Centrifugal forces are those that pull a country apart or create divisions within it. Religious differences fit this definition as they can create conflicts and divide people. A national holiday, on the other hand, is a unifying force and brings people together. An attack by another country can also bring people together in defense of their country, rather than pull them apart. A charismatic national leader can be a unifying force, but it is not necessarily a centrifugal force.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Religious differences.",

            "model_answer": "Early settlements and high population density along coastlines and rivers can be attributed to the access to trade routes. When people settle near water bodies, it is usually because it provides them with a means of transportation and communication with other settlements. This promotes trade and commerce, which in turn boosts the economy. Additionally, water bodies provide a reliable source of water for domestic, commercial, and agricultural activities. While Mediterranean climate, limited forest cover, and growth of manufacturing may influence settlement patterns, they do not provide a sufficient explanation for the concentration of settlements and high population density along coastlines and rivers. Therefore, the best answer is (D) Access to trade routes.",
