Therefore, we can eliminate them.\n\nStep 3: Compare between the remaining options.\nThe Retail Merchants Association and Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. could both potentially provide information on the credit rating of retail businesses. However, Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. is a well-known credit reporting agency, so it is more likely to have the necessary information. Therefore, we can choose option (C) as the answer.\n\nAnswer: C",

            "model_answer": "The answer to this question can be found by understanding the temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) of each material. TCR is a measure of how much the resistance of a material changes with temperature. A material with a lower TCR will have a resistance that is least affected by temperature changes.\n\n(A) Copper:\nCopper has a TCR of about 0.0039 (1/\u2103), which means its resistance increases as temperature increases. Therefore, copper is not the answer.\n\n(B) Carbon:\nThe TCR of carbon can vary depending on its form (e.g. graphite vs diamond), but generally speaking, it has a negative TCR around -0.0005 to -0.0008 (1/\u2103). This means its resistance decreases as temperature increases, but it is still affected by temperature changes. Therefore, carbon is not the answer.\n\n(C) Germanium:\nGermanium has a positive TCR of about 0.46 (1/\u2103), which means its resistance increases significantly as temperature increases. Therefore, germanium is not the answer.\n\n(D) Silicon:\nSilicon has a TCR of about 0.0005 (1/\u2103), which is lower than copper and germanium, and even lower than carbon. This means its resistance is least affected by temperature changes. Therefore, the answer is (D) Silicon.",
