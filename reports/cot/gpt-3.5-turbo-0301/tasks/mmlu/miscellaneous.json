Option A, the Retail Merchants Association, and option B, the local chamber of commerce, are not specialized in credit ratings. Option D, the United States Retail Credit Association, sounds like a credible source, but it does not exist. Therefore, the correct option is C, Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., which provides credit ratings for many businesses. \n\nAnswer: (C)",

Which of the following best describes this instructional strategy?\n\n(A) Conferencing\n(B) Discipline-based inquiry\n(C) Self-Regulated Strategy Development\n(D) Introduction-Body-Conclusion strategy",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The instructional strategy described here involves presenting students with examples of a genre and working with them to identify defining characteristics. This is likely to be part of a larger unit on writing short stories, and the goal is to help students understand the elements that make up the genre. Option (B) Discipline-based inquiry seems like the best fit for this strategy, as it involves engaging students in exploring a particular discipline or subject area. Option (A) Conferencing may involve one-on-one or small group meetings with students to discuss their individual progress or goals, which doesn't seem to match the scenario. Option (C) Self-Regulated Strategy Development is a specific method for teaching students to become more effective writers, but it doesn't necessarily involve exploring genre characteristics. Option (D) Introduction-Body-Conclusion is a common organizational structure for writing, but it doesn't address the process of identifying the elements that make up a specific genre. Therefore, the answer is (B) Discipline-based inquiry.",

Organic compounds typically undergo combustion (burning) at temperatures ranging from 300 to 600 degrees Celsius (572 to 1112 degrees Fahrenheit). Therefore, paper will burn at a temperature lower than 2125 degrees Fahrenheit, which eliminates option (B) from consideration. Option (C) is also too high, as it is above the melting point of iron. Option (A) is close to the correct range, but a bit too low. The correct answer is (D), 451 degrees Fahrenheit, which is also known as the autoignition temperature of paper.",
