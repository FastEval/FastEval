            "question": "Digital images are often represented by the red, green, and blue values (an RGB triplet) of each individual pixel in the image. A photographer is manipulating a digital image and overwriting the original image. Which of the following describes a lossless transformation of the digital image?\n\n(A) Compressing the image in a way that may lose information but will suffer only a small loss of image quality.\n(B) Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image. The new value of each pixel represents a shade of gray, ranging from white to black.\n(C) Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed.\n(D) Modifying part of the image by taking the pixels in one part of the picture and copying them to the pixels in another part of the picture.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what a lossless transformation means. A lossless transformation is one where the original information is preserved and no data is lost. Therefore, option (A), compressing the image, is not a lossless transformation because it may lose information.\n\nOption (B), creating a grayscale image by averaging the RGB values, is a lossless transformation because all the original information is preserved. This is because the new grayscale value is calculated using the original RGB values, so no data is lost.\n\nOption (C), creating the negative of an image, is also a lossless transformation because all the original information is preserved. This is because we simply subtract the RGB values from 255 to obtain the new values, so all the original information is still present.\n\nOption (D), modifying parts of the image by copying pixels, is not necessarily a lossless transformation. It depends on how the copying is done and whether any data is lost in the process. Therefore, it is not a valid answer.\n\nSo, the answer is either (B) or (C). Both options are lossless transformations of the digital image. However, (C) involves a more significant change to the image, as the colors are completely reversed. Therefore, the better answer is (B). \n\nAnswer: B",
