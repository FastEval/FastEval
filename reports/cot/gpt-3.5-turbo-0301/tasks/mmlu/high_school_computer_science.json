It shifts the bits of the first operand (in this case, x) to the left by the number of positions specified in the second operand (in this case, 3).\n\nSo, x << 3 will shift the bit of 1 to the left by 3 positions, which will result in the binary number 1000, which is equivalent to the decimal number 8.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 8.",
