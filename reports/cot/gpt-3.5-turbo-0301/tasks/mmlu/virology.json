            "model_answer": "Step 1: AIDS activism began in the U.S. in the 1980s and was born out of a need for action due to the devastating impact of the AIDS epidemic.\n\nStep 2: Activists, many of them members of the LGBTQ+ community, demanded action from the government and pharmaceutical companies to address the crisis and find a cure for AIDS.\n\nStep 3: One major outcome of AIDS activism was the reform of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Activists criticized the FDA for its slow and bureaucratic approval process for new drugs and demanded that it be streamlined to allow faster access to potentially life-saving treatments.\n\nStep 4: As a result of this pressure, the FDA created the fast-track drug approval process for investigational drugs, also known as \"compassionate use.\" This allowed patients with life-threatening illnesses to access drugs that were still in the testing phase but showed promise for treating their condition.\n\nStep 5: AIDS activism also led to changes in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S. For example, activists pushed for greater patient involvement in medical decision-making, as well as for more equitable access to healthcare.\n\nStep 6: Given all of these outcomes, the correct answer is (D) All of the above.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to look at statistics on global causes of death. According to the World Health Organization, the leading cause of death worldwide in 2019 was cardiovascular disease, accounting for 17.9 million deaths. However, this option is not given in the question. \n\nNext, we can eliminate options based on their prevalence. While each of the given options are major causes of death globally, we can narrow down the choices by looking at their prevalence relative to each other. According to the WHO, in 2019, the number of deaths caused by respiratory infections was 3.0 million, by diarrheal diseases was 1.5 million, by malaria was 409,000, and by tuberculosis was 1.4 million. This means that respiratory infections and tuberculosis are more prevalent than diarrheal diseases and malaria. \n\nTherefore, the most probable answer is either A or D. To choose between them, we need to look at more recent statistics. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, and respiratory infections became a leading cause of death worldwide. According to the WHO, as of August 2021, COVID-19 has caused over 4 million deaths globally. Therefore, the answer is (A) Respiratory infections.",

This is also a recommendation by AAP.\nConsidering the limited access to safe water and low levels of education in the countries mentioned in the question, it may be challenging to prepare formula safely and maintain proper hygiene. Therefore, exclusive breastfeeding would be the best option to reduce the risk of infections and provide optimal nutrition to the infants.\nBased on this, the answer is (B) Exclusively breastfed for six months.",

According to this theory, the adoption of a new idea or product typically follows a bell curve, with certain segments of society being more likely to adopt the change than others. \n\nThe first segment is the Innovators, who are a small percentage of the population who are the first to adopt a change. They are risk-takers and often have high levels of education and exposure to information. However, they typically have limited influence over others in society.\n\nThe second segment is the Early Adapters, who are also a relatively small percentage of the population. They are influential and respected in their communities and are often opinion leaders. Their early adoption of a change can help to gain wider acceptance of the change among others.\n\nThe third segment is the Middle Adapters, who are typically the majority of the population. They are not as quick to adopt changes as the first two segments but are not resistant to change either. They need more information and social proof before they are willing to adopt the change.\n\nThe fourth and final segment is the Late Adapters, who are the most resistant to change and typically only adopt changes that are widely accepted by society or considered necessary. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n(C) Middle adapters",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The adaptive immune system is characterized by its ability to respond specifically to pathogens that it has encountered previously. This specificity is mediated by molecules on the surface of T and B cells, which can recognize and bind to specific molecules on the surface of pathogens. This recognition event leads to the activation of the adaptive immune response and the production of effector cells, such as antibody-secreting plasma cells and cytotoxic T cells, that can eliminate the pathogen. \n\nWhile all of the options listed are important components of the adaptive immune response, the most special characteristic is likely (C) Memory T cells. Memory T cells are a subset of T cells that are formed after an initial encounter with a pathogen. These cells are long-lived and can persist in the body for years or even decades, maintaining a \"memory\" of the pathogen. If the same pathogen is encountered again, memory T cells can quickly mount an immune response, leading to faster and more effective clearance of the pathogen. This ability to \"remember\" previous pathogen encounters is a hallmark of the adaptive immune system and is critical for providing long-term protection against infectious diseases. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",
