            "model_answer": "The AIDS epidemic in the U.S. during the 1980s and 1990s led to widespread activism by affected communities and their allies. This activism pushed for changes in government policies and medical practices to better address the crisis. Some of the specific outcomes of this activism include the following: \n\n- Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reforms, which helped accelerate the approval process for HIV/AIDS drugs and allowed for greater patient input in drug development (A)\n- Easier access to investigational drugs, which allowed people with HIV/AIDS to try new treatments that had not yet been approved by the FDA (B)\n- Changes in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S., including the development of new models of care that emphasized patient autonomy and community involvement (C)\n\nConsidering these outcomes, it can be concluded that the correct answer is (D) All of the above.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we can start by looking at the WHO's global burden of diseases report. According to the latest report, respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases are the top two causes of deaths globally. However, malaria and tuberculosis are also significant causes of mortality. \n\nTo determine which one of these four options is the most deadly globally, we need to look at the specific numbers. According to the same WHO report, in 2019, there were an estimated 2.6 million deaths due to lower respiratory infections and 1.6 million deaths due to diarrheal diseases. In comparison, there were 409,000 deaths due to malaria and 1.4 million deaths due to tuberculosis.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (A) Respiratory infections, as they cause the most deaths globally.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's consider the recommendation for infants in general. The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, followed by continued breastfeeding along with the introduction of other complementary foods.\n\nNext, we need to take into account the limited access to safe water and low levels of education in the countries in question. If safe water is not available, it may be difficult or even impossible to prepare formula safely. Additionally, if education around safe preparation and handling of formula is low, there may be an increased risk of contamination and illness for the infant.\n\nGiven these factors, it is likely that exclusive breastfeeding would be the safest and most feasible option for newborn infants in countries with limited access to safe water and low levels of education.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Exclusively breast fed for six months.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer to this question can be found by examining the diffusion of innovation theory. According to this theory, different segments of society adopt new ideas or innovations at different rates.\n\nThe first segment to adopt a new idea or innovation are the innovators. These individuals are typically adventurous, risk-taking, and willing to try out new things. However, their numbers are relatively small and they usually only have a small impact on the larger community.\n\nThe second segment to adopt a new idea are the early adapters. These individuals are also open to new ideas, but tend to be more practical and rational than innovators. They are often influential within their communities and can help to spread the word about the advantages of the new innovation.\n\nThe third segment to adopt a new idea are the middle adapters. These individuals may be somewhat skeptical or cautious about new ideas, and may take some convincing before they are willing to try something new. However, once they are convinced, they can help to bring about widespread adoption of the innovation.\n\nThe fourth and final segment to adopt a new idea are the late adapters. These individuals are often resistant to change and may only be convinced to adopt a new innovation once it has become widely accepted and established within their community.\n\nTherefore, achieving effective change in a community is usually dependent on the early adapters (B). These individuals are willing to try new things and are influential within their community, which can help to spread awareness of the innovation and encourage others to try it out as well.",

Therefore, it is less likely to be the correct answer.\n\nOption B mentions paying drug users for negative urine specimens, which is a common application of contingency management in the context of substance abuse. This is done to promote abstinence and reduce the risk of relapse, by providing a tangible reward for staying clean. \n\nOption C mentions paying sex workers to use condoms, which is not a common application of contingency management. Although this strategy could have some benefits in terms of promoting safer sex practices, it is not typically used as part of a contingency management program.\n\nOption D mentions paying drug users to use condoms, which is not a common application of contingency management. While it is important to promote safe sex practices among drug users, this particular strategy is not typically used as part of a contingency management program.\n\nTherefore, the most likely correct answer is (B) Paying drug users for negative urine specimens.\n\nAnswer: B",

This is in contrast to the innate immune system, which provides a more general, non-specific response to pathogens. \n\n(A) Antibodies are produced by B cells in response to specific pathogens, and are important in neutralizing or tagging pathogens for destruction by other immune cells. While important, the production of antibodies is not unique to the adaptive immune system, as non-adaptive immune cells such as NK cells can also produce antibodies.\n\n(B) T cells are a type of lymphocyte that play an important role in coordinating immune responses and directly attacking infected host cells. While T cells are a critical component of the adaptive immune system, they are not unique to this system, as they can also be activated by innate immune mechanisms.\n\n(C) Memory T cells are a type of T cell that \"remember\" specific pathogens, allowing for a faster and more effective response upon subsequent exposure. This ability to form immunological memory is a defining characteristic of the adaptive immune system, as it allows for long-term protection against recurring infections.\n\n(D) Clonal expansion refers to the process by which a small number of immune cells specific to a pathogen rapidly proliferate in response to infection, generating a large population of effector cells. This process is essential for the adaptive immune response to be effective, but is not unique to this system, as non-adaptive immune cells such as NK cells can also undergo clonal expansion.\n\nTherefore, the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is (C) Memory T cells.",
