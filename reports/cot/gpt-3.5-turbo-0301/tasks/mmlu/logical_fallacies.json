            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what a disjunctive syllogism is.\n\nA disjunctive syllogism is a valid argument form that infers a conclusion from a disjunctive premise. A disjunctive premise is a statement that presents a choice between two or more alternatives, such as \"Either A or B.\"\n\nIn a valid disjunctive syllogism, the major premise must affirm one of the disjuncts or deny the other. This means that it must either affirm the antecedent (the first part) or deny the consequent (the second part). For example, \"Either I will go to the store or I will stay home. I will not go to the store. Therefore, I will stay home.\" Here, the major premise affirms the second disjunct and the conclusion follows logically.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent.",
