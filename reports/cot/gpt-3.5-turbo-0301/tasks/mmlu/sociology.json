            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\nMass-society theory is a perspective that suggests that the media plays a powerful role in shaping society and culture.\n\nOption (A): This option suggests that market forces determine the content of the media. While market forces do have an impact, this option implies that the media is solely driven by commercial interests and ignores other factors that may influence media content. Furthermore, this option does not address the potential consequences of media content on society as a whole.\n\nOption (B): This option suggests that members of the subordinate classes are subjected to and influenced by the ideology of the ruling class through the media. While this perspective emphasizes the power dynamic inherent in media representation, it does not necessarily suggest that the media manipulate or control audiences.\n\nOption (C): This option suggests that the media manipulate \"the masses\" as vulnerable and passive consumers. This perspective places a great deal of power in the hands of the media and implies that audiences are incapable of making their own choices. However, audience members are not passive and may actively interpret and respond to media messages.\n\nOption (D): This option suggests that audiences make selective interpretations of media messages. This perspective recognizes the active role of the audience in the interpretation of media messages and implies that audiences have agency in their responses to media representation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand who Becker was and his perspective on cannabis use. Howard Becker was a sociologist who studied deviance and social processes. He believed that deviance is not inherent in an act, but rather a result of the societal reaction to that act. \n\nFrom this perspective, we can eliminate options (C) and (D) because they suggest a value judgment on cannabis use rather than an objective observation. \n\nNext, we need to examine the options that remain. Option (A) suggests that cannabis use was increasing among all youth in the 1970s. This is possible, but we need more information to confirm or refute this claim. \n\nOption (B) suggests that cannabis use is learned gradually through a deviant career. This is in line with Becker's perspective and research on deviance. We know that Becker studied drug use and believed that it was learned behavior. Therefore, we can confidently choose option (B). \n\nAnswer: B",

This is a characteristic of the middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century as urbanization increased and the middle classes became involved in community organizations and activities.\n\nStep 4: Answer choice (B) states that the middle classes were too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness. This may be true to some degree, but it is not a defining characteristic of the middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century.\n\nStep 5: Answer choice (C) states that the middle classes were often involved in 'white collar' work. This is a characteristic of the middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century as industrialization and the growth of the service sector created new job opportunities in areas such as management, finance, and administration.\n\nStep 6: Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that answer choice (D) is correct as it includes all of the above characteristics that are true of the middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century.\n\nAnswer: D",

This is true as companies can collect data from consumers through various technological forms of surveillance such as tracking cookies, browsing history, etc. and use it for targeted marketing or even sell it to third-party companies.\n\nOption (B) states that technological surveillance can reduce prison overcrowding by the use of electronic tagging. Technological surveillance in the form of electronic tagging can help reduce prison overcrowding by allowing some offenders to serve their sentences in the community while still being monitored.\n\nOption (C) states that technological surveillance can monitor employees' activities at work. This is true as companies can use various forms of technological surveillance such as monitoring software, CCTV cameras, etc. to keep track of employees' activities at work.\n\nConsidering all the options, it can be concluded that (D) all of the above is the correct answer. \n\nAnswer: D",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "1. First, we need to understand what the concept of gemeinschaft entails. It is a German term meaning \"community\" or \"society\" and was developed by sociologist Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies in the 19th century.\n2. T\u00f6nnies argued that gemeinschaft was characterized by close-knit relationships based on personal bonds, shared values, and a sense of belonging. In such communities, people know each other well and are tightly interconnected.\n3. Next, we need to identify which of the options listed in the question describes similar relational characteristics as gemeinschaft. \n4. Option (C) gesellschaft is also a term coined by T\u00f6nnies, which he used to describe societies that are more formal and impersonal. In gesellschaft, social relationships are based on legal rules and individual interests rather than on personal bonds.\n5. Option (A) organic solidarity is a concept developed by Emile Durkheim and describes a sense of solidarity and interdependence among individuals in a society where people perform different specialized tasks and rely on each other to meet their needs. \n6. Option (B) mechanical solidarity, also proposed by Durkheim, refers to social cohesion based on shared traditions, customs, and values.\n7. Option (D) anomie describes a state of normlessness, lack of social norms or moral guidance, and feelings of confusion and uncertainty that may occur when social influences on behavior are weakened or absent. \n8. Therefore, option (B) mechanical solidarity is the closest to gemeinschaft in terms of relational characteristics, as they both involve a strong sense of social cohesion based on shared traditions, customs, and values that unify individuals within a society. \n\nThe answer is (B).",

            "model_answer": "Option (C) is the correct answer.\nIn option (A), if income tax rates increased equally for all occupational groups, then income inequality would not have increased in the 1980s as everyone would be impacted in the same way.\nIn option (B), if there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them, then this would actually decrease income inequality as more people would be employed in higher-paying jobs.\nIn option (D), if growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits, then this would likely increase income inequality as those on welfare benefits would likely have lower incomes compared to those employed.\nOption (C) states that the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings, which is a plausible explanation for income inequality as this would mean that people's purchasing power would decrease and those with higher incomes would still be able to afford the higher costs, while those with lower incomes would struggle more.
