            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\nThe Mass-society theory is a perspective that views society as dominated by media, technology, and propaganda. It suggests that:\n\n(A) Market forces determine the content of the media - while this may be true to some extent, it is not the core idea of the mass-society theory. Therefore, this option is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\n(B) The subordinate classes are dominated by the ideology of the ruling class - this refers to the idea that the media serves the interests of the elites and reinforces their dominant ideology. This is a key idea of the mass-society theory and therefore a possible answer.\n\n(C) The media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers - this is also a key idea of the mass-society theory and suggests that the media are powerful in shaping people's beliefs and behaviors. Therefore, this option is also a possible answer.\n\n(D) Audiences make selective interpretations of media messages - while this may be true, it is not a main premise of the mass-society theory. Therefore, this option is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the possible answers are (B) and (C). To choose between them, we need to look for the one that is more central to the theory. Since the idea of the media reinforcing the ideology of the elites is a common theme in social theories, while the notion of the media manipulating the masses as passive consumers is more specific to the mass-society theory, the correct answer is (C).\n\nAnswer: (C)",

            "question": "The ecological approach to urban sociology involved studying:\n\n(A) how social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources\n(B) the forms of wildlife and natural habitats that could be found on the edges of the city\n(C) the way in which people organized collective protests about environmental issues\n(D) how men and women used the city's public spaces differently",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The ecological approach to urban sociology suggests that we need to understand how people interact with their environment in urban areas. This includes not only the built environment, but also the natural environment. Therefore, option (B) about studying the forms of wildlife and natural habitats on the edges of the city seems like a plausible answer. However, it is important to note that the ecological approach is focused on the relationships between social groups and their environment. Therefore, option (A) about studying how social groups colonize different areas of the city and compete for resources is also a valid option. Option (C) about studying collective protests about environmental issues seems too narrow, as the ecological approach is not only concerned with protests, but with broader patterns of social and environmental interaction. Option (D) about studying how men and women use public spaces differently is not directly related to the ecological approach, although it may be a related research question. \n\nTherefore, the answer is either (A) or (B). However, based on the emphasis on studying the relationships between social groups and their environment, and the fact that option (B) only focuses on the edges of the city, option (A) is a more comprehensive and accurate answer. \n\nAnswer: A",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what Becker's views were on cannabis use. We can eliminate option C, as Becker did not view it as a dangerous pastime that young people should not be allowed to pursue. \n\nNext, option D is not entirely accurate as Becker did not necessarily say that cannabis use was not enjoyable. \n\nOption A is plausible, as Becker did suggest that cannabis use was increasing in popularity among young people in the 1970s. \n\nOption B is the most accurate as Becker proposed the idea of the \"marijuana user career\" and argued that the use of cannabis was learned gradually through social processes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B).",

            "model_answer": "First, let's consider statement A: Were the middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century urban and involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations? This is likely true, as the development of modern cities and an increase in social mobility allowed for the creation of a more participatory and engaged middle class.\n\nMoving on to statement B: Were the middle classes too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness? This is a bit more challenging to determine definitively, but it seems plausible that with increased diversity in terms of occupation, education, and social status within the middle class, a cohesive sense of shared class identity may have been more difficult to achieve.\n\nFinally, let's consider statement C: Were the middle classes often involved in 'white collar' work? This seems quite likely, as the expansion of the service sector during the nineteenth century led to a growth of work in managerial, administrative, and professional roles that would come to define the 'white collar' class.\n\nTaken together, it seems that all of these statements are true and can be summarized as follows:\n\n(D) all of the above",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking which statement is true regarding technological forms of surveillance. \n\nOption (A) is true because technological forms of surveillance, such as internet tracking and data mining, allow for easier access and exchange of personal information about consumers. \n\nOption (B) is not necessarily true, as it is a specific use case for electronic tagging and not applicable to all forms of technological surveillance.\n\nOption (C) is also true because many companies use surveillance technology to monitor employees and their activities at work, including internet usage and time spent at their desks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) all of the above.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies introduced the concept of Gemeinschaft, which refers to a traditional society where people form close-knit relationships based on kinship and mutual support. Organic solidarity, introduced by \u00c9mile Durkheim, refers to a modern society where people are interdependent based on a complex division of labor. Thus, organic solidarity is not the same as gemeinschaft. Mechanical solidarity, another concept introduced by Durkheim, refers to a traditional society where people are interdependent based on a similar division of labor, but without strong personal relationships. This is somewhat similar to gemeinschaft, but not exactly the same. Gesellschaft, also introduced by T\u00f6nnies, refers to a modern society where people form social relationships based on mutual self-interest rather than traditional ties. This is opposite to gemeinschaft. Anomie, introduced by Durkheim, refers to a situation in modern society where there is a breakdown of social norms and values, leading to a sense of normlessness and confusion. This is not related to gemeinschaft either. Therefore, the answer is (C) gesellschaft.",

They argue that patriarchy isn't just a cultural or social phenomenon, but rather arises from the economic and material conditions of society. As such, they explain patriarchy in terms of the relationship between capitalism and male domination, with both systems reinforcing each other. They argue that women's exploitation and subjugation is rooted in their role as a reserve army of labor for capitalism, as well as in the gendered division of labor that relegates women to unpaid domestic work. This gendered division of labor is shaped by capitalism, which creates a hierarchy of labor that devalues women's work and prioritizes men's work.
