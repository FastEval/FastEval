            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "London dispersion forces are a type of intermolecular force that arises due to temporary dipoles created by the position of electrons around the nuclei in a molecule. These temporary dipoles are a result of random fluctuations in electron distribution. This means that at any given time, there may be a slightly unequal distribution of electrons around a molecule, which results in the formation of a temporary dipole. This dipole can induce a dipole in a neighboring molecule, leading to an attractive force between the two molecules. Hence, the correct answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The first ionization energy is the energy needed to remove one electron from a neutral atom in the gas phase. Elements with a smaller atomic radius generally have a higher ionization energy because the electrons are closer to the nucleus and therefore more strongly attracted to it. Carbon has a relatively small atomic radius of 77 pm, suggesting that it should have a relatively high first ionization energy.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option (A) has a smaller atomic radius and a higher first ionization energy than carbon, so it is not a likely candidate. Option (B) has a larger atomic radius and a lower first ionization energy than carbon, making it a less likely candidate. Option (C) has a much larger atomic radius and a much lower first ionization energy than carbon, making it highly unlikely. Option (D) has a smaller atomic radius than carbon, suggesting a higher first ionization energy, which is plausible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 40 pm, 995 kJ/mol.",
