            "model_answer": "London dispersion forces are caused by the temporary dipoles created by the position of electrons around the nuclei in a molecule. This is because even in nonpolar molecules, there is always a slight variation in electron density which can result in temporary, instantaneous dipoles. These dipoles can then induce similar dipoles in neighboring molecules, creating a weak force of attraction between them. Therefore, the answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "The first ionization energy is the energy required to remove one electron from an atom in the gas phase. The greater the ionization energy, the more difficult it is to remove the electron. Therefore, the larger the atomic radius, the lower the ionization energy. \n\nCarbon has a relatively small atomic radius of 77 pm, which means it has a strong attraction between the positively charged nucleus and its negatively charged electrons. This also means that it would require a significant amount of energy to remove an electron, which is reflected in the high first ionization energy of 1086 kJ/mol. \n\nBased on this information, we can eliminate options (A) and (C) since they suggest a larger atomic radius, which would result in a lower first ionization energy. \n\nOption (B) suggests a slightly larger atomic radius of 86 pm, which would still result in a relatively high first ionization energy, making it a plausible answer. \n\nOption (D) suggests an extremely small atomic radius of 40 pm, which is not consistent with the known properties of carbon. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 86 pm, 898 kJ/mol.",

This rules out nonpolar covalent bonding, which has weak intermolecular forces. The substance's poor conductivity and insolubility in water also suggest that it does not have freely moving ions or polar molecules, further ruling out ionic bonding. Covalent network bonding involves strong covalent bonds between atoms in a repeating network structure, which would also result in a high melting point and poor conductivity.

So this cannot be the reason for sulfuric acid being a stronger acid.\n\nB) While the number of oxygen atoms in a compound can affect its acidity, this is not always the case. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid despite having no oxygen atoms. Therefore, the number of oxygen atoms alone is not a sufficient explanation for the difference in acidity between sulfurous acid and sulfuric acid.\n\nC) This is a possible explanation, as electronegativity can affect the strength of an acid. When a more electronegative atom is bonded to hydrogen, it will draw the electron density away from the hydrogen, making it more likely to dissociate and release a proton. Therefore, sulfuric acid may be more acidic than sulfurous acid due to the higher electronegativity of the sulfur atom.\n\nD) This is not a valid explanation for the difference in acidity between sulfurous acid and sulfuric acid.
