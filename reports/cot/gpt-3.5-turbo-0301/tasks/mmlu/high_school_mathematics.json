This is a diagonal line with a slope of 1 that passes through the origin (0,0).\n\nNext, we use the formula for reflecting a point across a line to find the coordinates of each vertex of P' by switching the x and y coordinates of each vertex of P and plugging them into the equation of the line of reflection.\n\nFor example, the first point of P is (-2, -4). If we switch the x and y coordinates, we get the point (-4, -2). To reflect this point across the line y = x, we plug in x = -2 and y = -4 into the equation y = x to get:\n\nx = y\n-4 = x\n\nSo the reflected point is (-4, -4).
