            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "When crimes are committed on board vessels, the question of which State has jurisdiction over the crime can be complex. However, as a general rule, it is the flag State that ordinarily exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels flying its flag. This is because the flag State has primary responsibility for regulating and enforcing laws on its vessels, even when they are in international waters. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) the flag State.",

            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to define Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention. R2P is a principle that states that the international community has a responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, is when a state or group of states intervenes in another state to protect the population from gross human rights abuses.\n\nOption (A) can be ruled out because we know that these two concepts have different names and are discussed separately in international relations. \n\nOption (B) is partially correct. R2P does require a call for assistance by the State in distress, but it also allows for intervention without such a call, if the State is unwilling or unable to protect its population. \n\nOption (C) is the correct answer. R2P is less arbitrary than humanitarian intervention because it requires some input from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis. This means that R2P is not solely based on the interests of individual states and their political agendas, but rather on the goal of preventing human suffering. \n\nOption (D) is incorrect because R2P does not always involve armed force. In fact, non-violent measures such as diplomacy, mediation, and economic sanctions are preferred over military intervention whenever possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what is meant by \"peaceful settlement of disputes.\" This refers to the resolution of conflicts or disagreements between countries without resorting to the use of force or violence.\n\nOption (A) states that it is an obligation of result, which means that states are strictly obligated to resolve their disputes as soon as possible. This is not entirely accurate as there may be situations where a peaceful resolution is not possible or may take time to achieve.\n\nOption (B) states that it is an obligation of conduct, which means that states have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means, but this does not necessarily mean that they are obligated to resolve the disputes entirely. This is a more accurate representation of the obligation of peaceful settlement of disputes.\n\nOption (C) states that it is a peremptory norm of international law and all states have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute. This is also accurate as the peaceful settlement of disputes is considered a fundamental principle of international law and any violation of this norm is considered a breach of international law.\n\nOption (D) states that it is an obligation which concerns solely international courts and tribunals. This is not accurate as the obligation of peaceful settlement of disputes applies to all states and not just international courts and tribunals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) - It is an obligation of conduct, ie States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means.

            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what Protocol 14 is and what changes it made to the European Court of Human Rights. Protocol 14 was an amendment to the European Convention on Human Rights, aimed at improving the efficiency of the European Court of Human Rights. It was adopted in 2004 and came into force in 2010.\n\n(A) Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three judge to a one judge formation: This statement is true. Protocol 14 did indeed change the formation of the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three-judge to a single-judge formation.\n\n(B) Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility: This statement is also true. Protocol 14 added a new admissibility criterion, which requires applicants to demonstrate that the case raises a serious question affecting the interpretation or application of the Convention or its protocols, or which raises serious issues of general importance.\n\n(C) Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights: This statement is false. The Commission of Human Rights was actually abolished by Protocol 11, which came into force in 1998, not Protocol 14.\n\n(D) Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights: This statement is false. Protocol 14 did not extend the judicial term of office for the judges of the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is: (C) Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights.",

Non-state actors such as international organizations and individuals may also have international legal personality.\n\nOption C is incorrect because challenging the authority of States is not necessarily a characteristic of international legal personality. \n\nOption D is partially correct in that international legal personality distinguishes between legal and physical persons under international law.

It was created by the UN General Assembly and is responsible for addressing human rights violations around the world, but it is not specifically tied to any one human rights treaty.\n\nOption C, the UN Universal Periodic Review, is also not a treaty-based human rights mechanism. It is a process by which the human rights records of UN member states are reviewed and evaluated, but it is not created by any human rights treaty.\n\nOption D, the UN special mandates, refers to various experts and working groups appointed by the UN to investigate and report on specific human rights issues. While some of these mandates may be created by human rights treaties, the term \"UN special mandates\" is not specific enough to determine whether it is a treaty-based human rights mechanism or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) The UN Human Rights Committee.",
