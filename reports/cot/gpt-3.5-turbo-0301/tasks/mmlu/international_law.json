            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "When crimes are committed on board a vessel, the question of which State has jurisdiction over the matter arises. Generally, there are three possible States that may exercise jurisdiction: the coastal State, the flag State, and all States. \n\nThe coastal State, as the name suggests, refers to the State that has sovereignty over the coast where the vessel is located. The coastal State may exercise jurisdiction over crimes that occur within its territorial sea or the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which extends up to 200 nautical miles from the coast. \n\nThe flag State, on the other hand, refers to the State whose flag the vessel is flying. This State has jurisdiction over crimes committed on board the vessel itself, regardless of where it is located in the world. This is known as the principle of flag state jurisdiction. \n\nFinally, all States enjoy the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows them to exercise jurisdiction over certain crimes, such as piracy, that are considered to be a threat to the international community as a whole.\n\nIn the case of crimes committed on board a vessel, the State that ordinarily exercises jurisdiction is the flag State (B).",

            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\nThe term \"justiciability\" has \"justice\" as its root, indicating that it likely has to do with some aspect of justice or fairness.\n\nOption A defines justiciability as the possibility of enforcement of a right, but this does not necessarily have anything to do with justice or fairness. It is simply a logistical question of whether the right can be enforced.\n\nOption B uses the word \"just\" but does not actually define or explain what it means by this. It also does not seem to relate to a court's ability to enforce a right.\n\nOption C says that justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether non-enforcement of a right conforms to principles of justice. This seems very plausible, as it suggests that when a court determines a right is justiciable, they are determining if it is fair and just to enforce that right through the court system.\n\nOption D refers to a state's obligation to enforce a right, but this does not seem to be what justiciability means, as it does not necessarily involve the act of assessment or determination by a court of justice.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n(C)",

            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Firstly, it is important to define Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention. R2P is a principle agreed upon by United Nations member states in 2005, which holds that the international community has a responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. Humanitarian intervention is similar in that it involves the use of military force to protect civilians, but it is not based on a formalized principle like R2P.\n\nNext, we can examine the ways in which R2P is different from humanitarian intervention. Option (A) suggests that they are essentially the same, but this is not the case. R2P is a specific principle that outlines the responsibility to protect populations, whereas humanitarian intervention is a broader concept that can be used in a variety of contexts.\n\nOption (B) suggests that R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress. This is partially true - R2P does require a state to be in distress before action is taken, but it does not necessarily require a call for assistance. In some cases, the international community may be aware of a situation and intervene without waiting for a formal request.\n\nOption (C) suggests that R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis. This is partially true as well - R2P does involve some input from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and its primary objective is to prevent humanitarian crises. However, it is not necessarily less arbitrary than humanitarian intervention. The decision to intervene is still based on subjective interpretations of what constitutes a humanitarian crisis.\n\nOption (D) suggests that R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not. This is false - R2P does not always involve armed force. It is a principle that encompasses a range of measures, including diplomatic interventions, sanctions, and peacekeeping operations.\n\nBased on these considerations, the correct answer is (C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we need to first understand the concept of the Lotus principle. The principle derives from a famous international law case, the Lotus case, which involved a collision between two ships on the high seas. The Lotus principle, as established in this case, holds that States are generally free to act as they choose within the bounds of international law, and that restrictions upon their independence cannot be presumed. \n\nOption (A) accurately describes this principle, stating that \"restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed\", and that \"whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law\". Option (B) is incorrect because it refers to a different principle, namely the principle of forum prorogatum, which allows States to choose the Court that will hear their disputes. Option (C) is also incorrect because it refers to the principle of enforcement jurisdiction, which concerns a State's power to enforce its laws on the high seas. Finally, option (D) refers to the general concept of customary international law, but does not specifically relate to the Lotus principle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).",

The UK operates under an unwritten constitution, which means that there is no single document that outlines the rules and principles that govern the country.

The UK does not have a system of judicial review like that found in the United States.\n\nStatement (C) is accurate. The UK Constitution is uncodified and is made up of a variety of sources, including Acts of Parliament, court decisions, and conventions.\n\nStatement (D) is not accurate.

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Read the question and options carefully.\nStep 2: Understand the concept of peaceful settlement of disputes in international law.\nStep 3: Option A states that it is an obligation of result, which means that states have a strict obligation to resolve their disputes as soon as possible. This seems too extreme and unrealistic, as not all disputes can be resolved immediately.\nStep 4: Option B seems more reasonable, as it states that states have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means, but it does not entail an obligation to actually resolve them. This aligns with the concept of an obligation of conduct.\nStep 5: Option C is a peremptory norm of international law, which means that it is a fundamental principle that cannot be violated by any state. This seems like a stronger statement than option B, but it also seems to encompass it, as safeguarding the application of the norm would include trying to resolve disputes through peaceful means.\nStep 6: Option D seems completely off-topic, as it concerns only international courts and tribunals, and not the general obligation of peaceful settlement of disputes among states.\nStep 7: Based on the above analysis, the best answer seems to be either option B or C. Option B seems more specific and focused, while option C is broader and more fundamental.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question and the options given.\n\nThe question is asking us to identify the false statement among the given options. We need to go through each statement and determine if it is true or false.\n\nStatement A: Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three judge to a one judge formation.\n\nStatement B: Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility.\n\nStatement C: Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights.\n\nStatement D: Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the truth of Statement A\n\nTo evaluate the truthfulness of Statement A, we need to understand what Protocol 14 did. Protocol 14 is an amendment to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which is also known as the European Convention on Human Rights. It was adopted on 13 May 2004 and entered into force on 1 June 2010.\n\nAccording to the European Court of Human Rights website, Protocol 14 aimed to improve the efficiency of the Court by, among other things, streamlining the processing of cases and reducing the workload of the Court. \n\nTo evaluate the truthfulness of Statement A, we need to know what an admissibility case is and what changes Protocol 14 made to the committee that hears these cases. An admissibility case is a case that is brought before the European Court of Human Rights to determine whether it meets the criteria for being heard by the Court. \n\nAccording to the website of the European Court of Human Rights, prior to the implementation of Protocol 14, admissibility cases were heard by a committee of three judges. Protocol 14 changed this by establishing a single-judge formation. This means that a single judge can determine the admissibility of a case, rather than a committee of three judges.\n\nTherefore, Statement A is true.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the truth of Statement B\n\nTo evaluate the truthfulness of Statement B, we need to know what criterion for admissibility existed before Protocol 14 and what new criterion was added by Protocol 14.\n\nAccording to the website of the European Court of Human Rights, before the implementation of Protocol 14, an application was admissible if it met three criteria: the application must be lodged by someone who can claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention; the application must be lodged against a state that has ratified the Convention; and the application must be lodged within six months of the final decision in the domestic proceedings.\n\nProtocol 14 did not add a new criterion for admissibility. Therefore, Statement B is false.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the truth of Statement C\n\nTo evaluate the truthfulness of Statement C, we need to know what the Commission of Human Rights is and whether Protocol 14 abolished it.\n\nThe Commission of Human Rights was a body established under the European Convention on Human Rights to examine individual complaints and to try to reach a friendly settlement between the parties. According to the website of the European Court of Human Rights, the Commission ceased to exist on 1 November 1998. Protocol 14 did not abolish the Commission of Human Rights because it no longer existed at the time Protocol 14 was adopted.\n\nTherefore, Statement C is false.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the truth of Statement D\n\nTo evaluate the truthfulness of Statement D, we need to understand what the term of office is for judges of the European Court of Human Rights and whether Protocol 14 extended it.\n\nAccording to the website of the European Court of Human Rights, before the implementation of Protocol 14, judges of the Court were elected for a term of six years and they could be re-elected. Protocol 14 extended the term of office for judges to nine years.\n\nTherefore, Statement D is true.\n\nStep 6: Output the answer\n\nBased on our evaluation of each statement, we can conclude that Statement B is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",
