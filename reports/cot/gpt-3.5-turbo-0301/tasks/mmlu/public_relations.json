            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Media tour.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- Media release typically involves sending out a written statement or announcement to journalists through various channels such as email, fax, and/or newswire services. This tactic is used to inform the media about news or events related to an organization or product.\n\n- Press room is a physical or digital space set up by an organization to provide journalists with resources and information such as press releases, images, and multimedia content. Journalists can access this information at any time, but it does not necessarily involve a physical visit.\n\n- Promotional days/weeks involve organizing special events or activities to promote a product or service. These events may include contests, giveaways, and product demonstrations, but they may not necessarily involve journalists visiting specific locations.\n\n- Media tour is a common public relations tactic that involves inviting journalists to visit a specific location such as a factory, office, or research facility. The purpose is to give journalists a firsthand experience of the organization or product in question. This tactic is often used in industries such as tourism, food, and technology. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Media tour.",

            "question": "You are the vice president of public relations for a corporation that produces a well-known brand of food products. In the Albany, New York, market, one of your products has recently been found to have some contamination. While apparently not fatal, it has given a large number of consumers severe stomach cramps and other intestinal problems. The cause has been traced back to your product, which is sold throughout the nation. Your CEO wants to know what you would advise to keep the situation from becoming a public relations disaster. What should you recommend?\n\n(A) Quickly investigate to make certain your product is definitely the cause of the illness.\n(B) Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product.\n(C) Stop sales of the product in the Albany, New York, market and issue a recall for that product.\n(D) Issue a press release to the Albany, New York, market explaining how to treat the symptoms.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: The first step is to ensure that the product is actually the cause of the illness. Therefore, option (A) should be recommended as the initial step.\n\nStep 2: Once the product has been confirmed as the cause, the next step should be to contain the issue by stopping the sales of the product. Therefore, options (B) and (C) are possible solutions.\n\nStep 3: Since the contamination has affected a large number of consumers, it is important to issue a recall for the product to ensure that no further harm is done. This makes options (B) and (C) more viable solutions.\n\nStep 4: Option (D) is not a suitable option in this case. Providing information on how to treat symptoms is not a solution to the underlying issue of contamination.\n\nTherefore, the recommended solution is to stop sales of the product in the Albany, New York, market and issue a recall for that product. The answer is (C).",

Kendall (1999) developed the Strategy-Structure-Process (SSP) framework, which emphasizes the alignment of strategic goals, organizational structure, and business processes. Merston (1963) proposed a five-step planning model that includes goal setting, environmental analysis, strategy formulation, program development, and implementation. Parkinson and Ekachai (2006) developed the Strategy Implementation Process (SIP) model, which emphasizes the importance of communication, coordination, and control in implementing strategy.\n\nFrom these models, we can see that the common elements are strategy and implementation.
