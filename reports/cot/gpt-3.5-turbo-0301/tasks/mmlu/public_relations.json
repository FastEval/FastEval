Kendall (1999) may focus on strategy and evaluation, as he is known for his work on strategic planning. Merston (1963) may have focused on implementation in his planning model, as implementation is a crucial aspect of turning plans into action. Parkinson and Ekachai (2006) may have emphasized strategy and implementation, given that their book is titled \"The Art of Strategy Implementation.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the common elements among the four planning models are likely to be strategy and evaluation. Both Kendall and Parkinson and Ekachai focus on strategy, while Hendrix and Merston emphasize evaluation. Strategy and evaluation are both essential components of effective planning, as strategies must be evaluated to ensure they are achieving the intended objectives.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Strategy and evaluation.",
