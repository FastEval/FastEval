            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of a low-grade fever, cough, and runny nose. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04).

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question and given information. \n\nThe question asks us to interpret the results of a clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The trial was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo. The p-value is given as 0.04.\n\nStep 2: Determine the level of statistical significance.\n\nThe p-value given is 0.04, which means that there is a 4% probability that the results observed in the study are due to chance. The conventional threshold for statistical significance is 0.05, which means that results with a p-value less than 0.05 are considered statistically significant. Since the given p-value is less than 0.05, the results are statistically significant.\n\nStep 3: Determine the clinical significance.\n\nClinical significance refers to the practical importance of the findings in terms of their impact on patients' health and well-being. In this case, we need to ask ourselves whether a difference of 0.3 days in the mean time for resolution of symptoms is clinically significant for patients with the common cold.\n\nStep 4: Consider the magnitude of the effect.\n\nThe difference between the mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug and the placebo is only 0.3 days, which is a relatively small difference. It is possible that this difference might not be noticeable or important to patients in terms of their symptoms or overall health.\n\nStep 5: Make a conclusion based on both statistical and clinical significance.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the findings are statistically significant (because of the low p-value), but clinically insignificant (because of the small magnitude of the effect). Therefore, the most appropriate interpretation of these study results is (B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant.",

The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.

The weak femoral pulses and radiofemoral delay suggest aortic coarctation. The patient's age and history of pneumonia make the possibility of a ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus less likely. In terms of potential complications, aortic coarctation can lead to hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, which increase the risk of aortic aneurysm, cerebral hemorrhage, and heart failure.

She is crying all the time, will not get out of bed, and has rated her pain as 1-2 on a 10-point scale. She has hypertension and major depressive disorder and is currently on oxycodone, hydrochlorothiazide, and fluoxetine. On examination, she has a firm, distended abdomen with moderate tenderness over the liver. The most appropriate next step in management is to (B) assess for suicidal ideation. Patients with advanced cancer are at high risk for depression and suicidal ideation, and the patient's persistent crying and lack of engagement are concerning. The physician should assess the patient for suicidal ideation and intervene as needed. Reassurance alone is not appropriate, as the patient's symptoms may indicate a need for additional intervention. Dextroamphetamine therapy would not be indicated in this patient, as it is not a first-line treatment for depression and may be inappropriate for a patient with a history of hypertension. Increasing the oxycodone dosage may provide additional pain relief, but it is not likely to address the patient's emotional symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) assess for suicidal ideation.",
