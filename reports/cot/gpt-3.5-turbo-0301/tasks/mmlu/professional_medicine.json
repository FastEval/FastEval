            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "The patient is in active labor at 39 weeks' gestation. However, she is now only having intermittent, weak contractions and has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated. These findings suggest a diagnosis of hypotonic uterine dysfunction (C), which is characterized by weak, ineffective contractions leading to a prolonged latent phase of labor. This is in contrast to primary dysfunctional labor (D), which is characterized by inadequate contractions leading to stalled active labor. Braxton Hicks contractions (A) are irregular, painless contractions that occur in late pregnancy, and do not lead to cervical dilation and effacement. A lower uterine retraction ring (B) is a sign of obstructed labor, which is not present in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is hypotonic uterine dysfunction (C). \n\nAnswer: (C)",

            "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of a low-grade fever, cough, and runny nose. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04). Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation of these study results?\n\n(A) The findings are clinically and statistically significant\n(B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant\n(C) The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant\n(D) The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the terms \"clinically significant\" and \"statistically significant.\" \"Clinically significant\" refers to whether the difference in outcomes between the treatment group and control group is meaningful or important in a practical sense. \"Statistically significant\" refers to whether the difference in outcomes between the treatment group and control group is likely due to chance or if it is a real difference that can be attributed to the treatment.\n\nIn this case, the study found that the mean time for resolution of symptoms was 6.4 days for patients receiving the new drug and 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo. The fact that there was a difference between the two groups suggests that the drug may be effective in treating the common cold.\n\nThe p-value of 0.04 indicates that the probability of observing a difference as large or larger than this one due to chance alone is 4%, which is below the usual threshold of 5% for statistical significance. Therefore, we can say that the difference in outcomes between the treatment and control groups is statistically significant.\n\nHowever, the fact that the difference in mean time for resolution of symptoms is only 0.3 days suggests that the clinical significance of this difference may be small. In other words, while the drug may have some effect on reducing the duration of symptoms, it may not make a big difference in how patients actually feel or function during their illness.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate interpretation of these study results is (B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant.",

She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?\n\n(A) Median nerve at the wrist\n(B) Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm\n(C) Radial nerve at the forearm\n(D) Ulnar nerve at the elbow",

The fact that palpation of the right elbow produces severe pain in these fingers suggests nerve entrapment at the elbow.
