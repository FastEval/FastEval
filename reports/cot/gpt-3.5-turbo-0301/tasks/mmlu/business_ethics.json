            "model_answer": "The first blank mentions \"bitcoin\" and the following sentence talks about \"ethical implications\" and \"financial crime\", suggesting that we are talking about cryptocurrencies and their association with crime. So, option (A) and (B) can be eliminated. Now, we need to decide between options (C) and (D). The sentence mentions that cryptocurrencies are \"more secure\" which rules out option (D). Hence, the answer is (C) Cryptocurrencies, Cheap, Secure, Financial crime.",

            "model_answer": "The first part of the sentence says that advertising regulatory bodies suggest that adverts must not encourage something. Looking at the options, we can eliminate (C) and (D) since they both have \"safe practices\" which contradicts the idea of not encouraging something. \n\nThe next part of the sentence says that adverts must not cause \"unnecessary\" something. This eliminates (B) since it has \"serious\" after fear, which implies that fear may be necessary in some cases. \n\nThis leaves us with (A), which suggests that adverts must not encourage unsafe practices, cause unnecessary wants or fear, and must not cause trivial offense. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

The answer cannot be (A) or (B) because those options are referring to the rights of employees, which are the entitlements that employees have, and not their obligations. Option (C) could be a plausible answer, as employers also have duties towards their employees, but the question specifically asks for the responsibilities of workers towards their employer.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking which normative theory is most similar to corporate profit maximization, even though it is not directly prescribed by any major normative theory. \n\nHedonistic utilitarianism is a normative theory that states the best action is the one that maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain for the greatest number of people. It is not necessarily similar to corporate profit maximization, as the focus is on maximizing overall pleasure rather than profit.\n\nPreference utilitarianism is similar to hedonistic utilitarianism, but instead focuses on maximizing the satisfaction of individuals' preferences. Again, this is not necessarily similar to corporate profit maximization, as it does not solely focus on profit.\n\nThe Categorical Imperative is a deontological normative theory developed by Immanuel Kant. It states that one should act in such a way that one's actions could become a universal moral law. This theory is quite different from corporate profit maximization, as it is concerned with fulfilling one's duty and acting morally, rather than maximizing profit.\n\nThe ethics of care is a normative theory that emphasizes the importance of caring and relationships in moral decision-making. While it may seem quite different from corporate profit maximization, there may be some similarities in that the well-being of those involved in the corporation could be seen as a type of caring relationship. However, this is still not the most similar normative theory.\n\nTherefore, the normative theory to which corporate profit maximization is most similar is (A) hedonistic utilitarianism.",

This implies that the regulation is imposed by a higher authority, which rules out individual or voluntary forms of regulation. \n\nOption A (Legal) and Option D (Environmental) both fit this description as they are often imposed by governments or other regulatory bodies and go beyond voluntary agreements between CSOs and businesses. \n\nThe second blank refers to the connection or partnership between CSOs and businesses. Both options A and D use the word \"mechanics\" which does not fit the context as it refers to the technical details of how something works, rather than the relationship between organizations. \n\nThis leaves us with Option B (Civil) and Option C (Political) as the only choices, with Option B using the word \"Relations\" and Option C using the word \"Interactions\". Both of these words accurately describe the type of partnership that CSOs have with businesses. \n\nThe third blank refers to the focus of the regulation, which goes beyond just the partnership between CSOs and businesses. Option B (Outcomes) and Option C (Outcomes) both fit this description, while Options A (Mechanics) and D (Mechanics) do not. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Political.",

The term \"dynamic\" also implies a level of adaptability and responsiveness, but it does not specifically refer to fluidity in all three categories mentioned. \"Fluid\" matches the description provided, but \"flexible\" also seems to fit. \"Modern\" is a vague term and does not provide any specific information about the working practices in question. \n\nTherefore, the answer is either (B) Fluid or (C) Flexible.",
