            "model_answer": "The first blank refers to a type of currency that is becoming increasingly mainstream and has ethical implications. The second blank states that this currency is more of something (we don't yet know what) and expensive. Based on this, we can eliminate option (B) since it states that the currency is cheap. Option (D) can also be eliminated since it states that traditional currency is expensive, which is not accurate.\n\nNow, we are left with options (A) and (C). The third blank states that this currency is also secure, which means it cannot be option (A). Therefore, the answer is (C) Cryptocurrencies, Cheap, Secure, Financial crime.",

            "model_answer": "The term \"preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities\" suggests that the answer is related to the balance between work and other aspects of life. \n\nOption A, Presenteeism, refers to the act of being present at work but not being fully productive due to illness or other distractions. This is not related to the preferred ratio mentioned in the question. \n\nOption B, Absenteeism, refers to the act of not showing up for work. Again, this is not related to the preferred ratio mentioned in the question. \n\nOption C, Work-play balance, is a plausible answer as it refers to the balance between work and leisure activities. However, the more commonly used term for this is \"work-life balance,\" which is a more accurate description of the preferred ratio mentioned in the question. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Work-life balance.",

            "model_answer": "The key phrase in the question is \"comprising of a balanced network of interdependent organisms and their environments\". This suggests that the answer is related to ecosystems. \n\nOption (C), \"Ecological ecosystems\", is redundant since the word \"ecological\" already indicates that we are talking about ecosystems. \n\nOption (D), \"Corporate ecosystems\", seems to focus specifically on companies and industries rather than the entire network of organisms and environments, so it is unlikely to be the answer. \n\nOption (A), \"Industrial supply loops\", sounds like it could be related to interdependence and sustainability, but it doesn't include the idea of a balanced network of organisms and environments. \n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is option (B), \"Industrial ecosystems\", which includes the idea of interdependence and a balanced network of organisms and environments within an industrial context. \n\nAnswer: (B)",

The second blank refers to one party gaining more from the collaboration, which is referred to as benefits. This rules out option (B), which mentions resources instead of benefits.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Normative theories are frameworks that provide guidelines for making ethical decisions. Corporate profit maximization is often criticized as it can lead to unethical behavior, such as exploiting workers or damaging the environment, solely for the purpose of increasing profits. Therefore, we are looking for a normative theory that is similar to corporate profit maximization in the sense that it focuses on maximizing one value or goal.\n\nHedonistic utilitarianism is a normative theory that suggests we should act to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. This theory is not similar to corporate profit maximization as it focuses on the well-being of all individuals, not just the interests of a corporation.\n\nPreference utilitarianism is a normative theory that suggests we should act to maximize the satisfaction of preferences. Like hedonistic utilitarianism, it does not prioritize the interests of a corporation.\n\nThe Categorical Imperative is a normative theory developed by Immanuel Kant. It suggests that actions should be based on ethical principles that can be universally applied to all individuals. This theory is not similar to corporate profit maximization, which prioritizes the interests of a corporation over other individuals or groups.\n\nThe ethics of care is a normative theory that prioritizes the relationships and interdependence between individuals. While this theory emphasizes the importance of caring for others, it does not prioritize the interests of a corporation.\n\nTherefore, the normative theory most similar to corporate profit maximization is (A) hedonistic utilitarianism, which prioritizes the maximization of pleasure or happiness, a single goal, and in corporate profit maximization, the single goal is the maximization of profit.",

            "model_answer": "Milton Friedman was a prominent economist who believed in the principles of free market capitalism. He argued that businesses should focus solely on maximizing profits and increasing shareholder value. In his view, the only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders. This means that businesses should strive to make as much money as possible within the bounds of the law, and should not be expected to take on social or environmental issues unless they are directly related to the profitability of the company. Therefore, the answer is (A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders.",

This implies that it has to do with the government or legal system. Therefore, option (A) and option (B) are eliminated.\n\nThe third blank is describing what is being regulated. \"Mechanics\" in option (A) does not fit the context as it does not make sense for regulation to concern the mechanics of a process. \"Outcomes\" fits better as regulation often aims to achieve particular outcomes.

            "model_answer": "The question is asking for a term that describes working practices involving fluidity in three specific areas: temporal, spatial, and task-related. \n\nThe word \"fluidity\" suggests that these working practices are adaptable and able to change with circumstances. \n\nThe term \"modern\" is too vague to be the correct answer, as it does not give any indication of the specific characteristics of these working practices. \n\nThe term \"flexible\" is a possibility, as it suggests the ability to adapt and change. However, it does not specifically mention the three areas of temporal, spatial, and task-related fluidity. \n\nThe term \"dynamic\" is also a possibility, as it suggests movement and change. However, it could also refer to working practices that are high-energy and constantly active, which may not necessarily involve the three areas mentioned in the question. \n\nThe term \"fluid\" seems to be the best fit, as it directly relates to the idea of fluidity mentioned in the question. It also does not have any other connotations that could lead to confusion. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Fluid.",
