            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Type-Ia supernovae are characterized by the complete destruction of a white dwarf star. One possibility for this to happen is when the white dwarf is in a binary system and increases in mass due to accretion from its companion star, until it reaches a critical mass and undergoes a thermonuclear explosion, completely destroying it. Therefore, (A) is true for a type-Ia supernova. However, (B) and (C) are not true, as type-Ia supernovae can occur in both young and old galaxies, and they do not produce gamma-ray bursts. Additionally, (D) is partially true, as type-Ia supernovae do produce X-rays, but not necessarily high amounts of them. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D).\n\nWhen you know both the actual brightness and the apparent brightness of an object, you can use the inverse square law to estimate the distance to the object. The inverse square law states that the apparent brightness of an object decreases as the distance from the object increases squared. Therefore, if you know the actual brightness of the object and you measure the apparent brightness from your location, you can estimate the distance to the object using the inverse square law. This is useful in astronomy to estimate the distance to stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects.",

The scientific method involves forming a hypothesis (in this case, the attractive force between all objects), designing and conducting experiments to test the hypothesis, analyzing the data, and drawing a conclusion. If the results consistently support the hypothesis, it can become a widely accepted theory. However, even widely accepted theories can be challenged or revised in the future if new evidence emerges.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Let's first define what the \"outer solar system\" means. The outer solar system refers to the region of our solar system beyond the asteroid belt, which is roughly past the orbit of Mars.\n\nStep 2: Let's analyze statement (A). It claims that Titan is the only outer solar system moon with a thick atmosphere. We know that the outer solar system contains four giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each of these planets has many moons, some of which are larger than the planet Mercury. Examples include Ganymede (a moon of Jupiter) and Triton (a moon of Neptune). We also know that several of these moons have atmospheres, such as Ganymede and Callisto (both moons of Jupiter) and Triton. However, statement (A) claims that Titan is the only one with a \"thick\" atmosphere. Therefore, statement (A) is either true or false.\n\nStep 3: Let's analyze statement (B). It claims that Titan is the only outer solar system moon with evidence for recent geologic activity. Geologic activity refers to things like volcanoes, earthquakes, and tectonic activity. We know that some outer solar system moons exhibit such activity, such as Io (a moon of Jupiter) which has active volcanoes. However, statement (B) says \"recent\" geologic activity. Therefore, statement (B) is either true or false.\n\nStep 4: Let's analyze statement (C). It claims that Titan's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrocarbons. This is actually true. The atmosphere of Titan is mostly nitrogen, followed by methane and other hydrocarbons.\n\nStep 5: Let's consider statement (D), which says that both (A) and (C) are true. We know that (C) is true, but we're not sure about (A) yet. If (A) is true, then (D) is true. If (A) is false, then (D) is false.\n\nStep 6: Now let's piece everything together. Statement (C) is true. Statement (B) is false because there are other moons with recent geologic activity. Therefore, options (A) and (D) are the only possible correct answers. We already know that (C) is true, so we just need to determine whether (A) is true or false. We previously noted that several outer solar system moons have atmospheres, but the claim in (A) is specifically about \"thick\" atmospheres. Titan is indeed the only outer solar system moon with a thick atmosphere. Therefore, (D) is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: D",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "We know that the minimum impact speed occurs when the comet and the earth's escape velocities are equal. Setting the two equal and solving for the velocity yields:\n\nsqrt(2GM/R) = sqrt(2Gm/v)\n\nSquaring both sides and cancelling out the 2's yields:\n\nGM/R = Gm/v\n\nSolving for v gives:\n\nv = sqrt(GM/R)\n\nNow, to find the total energy released in the impact, we can use the formula:\n\nE = 0.5*m*v^2 + 0.5*M*v^2\n\nSubstituting the value we found for v, we get:\n\nE = 0.5*m*(GM/R) + 0.5*M*(GM/R)\n\nFactoring out the common term, we get:\n\nE = 0.5*(GM/R)*(m + M)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nE = (GMm)/(2R^2) + (GMM)/(2R^2)\n\nCombining the two terms, we get:\n\nE = (GM(m+M))/(2R^2)\n\nThis is equivalent to answer choice (C).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",
