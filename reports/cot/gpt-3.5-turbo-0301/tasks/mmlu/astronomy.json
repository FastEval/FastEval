            "model_answer": "Type-Ia supernovae are known as \"standard candles\" because they have a consistent luminosity, making them useful for measuring distances in astronomy. They result from the explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system, where the white dwarf accretes matter from its companion until it exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit and undergoes a runaway nuclear fusion reaction.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D).\n\nExplanation:\nThe apparent brightness of an object depends on its actual brightness as well as its distance from the observer. The farther away an object is, the dimmer it appears. Therefore, if you know both the actual brightness and the apparent brightness of an object, you can use the inverse square law to estimate its distance:\n\ndistance = sqrt(actual brightness / apparent brightness)\n\nYou cannot estimate the object's speed, composition, or size with just this information.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is C. \n\nThe reason for this is because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, where light waves in the atmosphere are scattered by gas molecules and particles in the air. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than other colors, so it gets scattered more easily, making the sky appear blue to us on the ground. This is why at sunrise and sunset, when the sun is low on the horizon, the sky takes on orange and red hues, because the longer wavelengths of light are scattered more.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "We can use conservation of energy to find the total energy released in the impact. Initially, the comet has kinetic energy given by 0.5*m*v^2, where v is the minimum impact speed. \n\nUpon impact, the kinetic energy will be converted into other forms of energy such as heat, sound, and deformation of the earth. Let E be the total energy released in the impact. By conservation of energy, we have:\n\n0.5*m*v^2 = E\n\nTo find E, we need to express v in terms of M and R. We can use the concept of escape velocity, which is the minimum speed needed for an object to escape the gravitational pull of a celestial body. For the earth, the escape velocity is given by:\n\nv_esc = sqrt(2GM/R)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant. The minimum impact speed is less than the escape velocity, so we can write:\n\nv = f*v_esc, \n\nwhere f is a dimensionless factor less than 1. We do not know the exact value of f, but we know that it is related to the coefficient of restitution, which governs how much of the kinetic energy is converted into other forms of energy upon impact. For simplicity, we assume that f is a constant.\n\nSubstituting for v, we get:\n\n0.5*m*(f^2)*(2GM/R) = E\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nE = 0.5*m*(f^2)*(2GM/R)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

The given information mentions that some of the water is frozen in the soil and ice caps while some was lost due to solar wind stripping. However, much of the original water is believed to have been lost through another mechanism. Option (A) suggests that the magnetic field stripped away the water when it rapidly decreased in strength, but there is no mention of this in the given information. Option (C) can be eliminated as it is not a scientifically supported explanation. Option (D) suggests that the water was vaporized during a period of intense volcanism and lost to space through thermal escape, which is a possible explanation based on scientific evidence. Option (B) states that the water was broken down into hydrogen and oxygen by ultraviolet light and the hydrogen was lost through thermal escape, which is also a scientifically plausible explanation.

Radioactive dating of lunar samples has revealed that they are, on average, about 4.5 billion years old, while the oldest rocks on Earth are around 3.8 billion years old.
