That is, $d_i$ can only be 1, 2, 4, or 8.\n\nIf there is an element of order 8 in $G$, then there must be no elements of order 4 (since any element of order 4 would generate a subgroup of order 4, which is not possible), and there can be at most one element of order 2 (since any two elements of order 2 would combine to give an element of order 4).

Therefore, there are 5^8 polynomials in P, so the dimension of P is 5^8.\n\nNext, we need to determine the dimension of the range r of D. Since the derivative of a polynomial reduces its degree by 1, the degree of p\u2032(x) is less than or equal to 6. Therefore, the coefficients of p\u2032(x) correspond to the coefficients of p(x) with degree 1 or higher. This means that the first coefficient of p(x) does not affect p\u2032(x), so we can set it to any value. The remaining 7 coefficients have 5 possible values each. Therefore, the dimension of the range r of D is 5^7.\n\nFinally, we need to determine the dimension of the null space n of D. If p\u2032(x) = 0, then p(x) is a constant polynomial (i.e. degree 0).
