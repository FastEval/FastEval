            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The term for a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome of negotiations between parties is not \"bargaining,\" as bargaining refers to the process of making offers and counteroffers in order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. \"Accepting\" is also not the correct term, as it implies that one party simply agrees to the other party's demands without any negotiation or compromise. \"Compromising\" comes closer to the correct answer, as it involves both parties making concessions in order to reach an agreement. However, the term that specifically refers to a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome is \"satisficing.\" This term combines \"satisfy\" and \"suffice\" and refers to the decision-making strategy of choosing an option that is not optimal but that meets the minimum criteria for acceptance. Therefore, the answer is (B) Satisficing.",

Among these five forces, the type of competitive activity that exists between organizations is the level of rivalry (D).

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we first need to understand what a 'transformational' leader is. Transformational leadership is a leadership style where the leader inspires and motivates followers to achieve a shared vision and work towards common goals. Transformational leaders are often seen as charismatic, visionary, and able to create meaningful change within an organization or society.\n\nNow, considering the given options, it's clear that Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachov, and Nelson Mandela are all political leaders who have been described as transformational leaders. Margaret Thatcher was known for her conservative economic policies and leadership during the Cold War, Mikhail Gorbachev was instrumental in the liberalization and democratization of the Soviet Union, and Nelson Mandela was a key figure in the anti-apartheid movement and worked to promote racial reconciliation in South Africa.\n\nBill Clinton, on the other hand, while certainly a prominent political leader, may not necessarily be considered a 'transformational' leader in the same way as the other options. While he did achieve some notable accomplishments during his presidency, such as balancing the federal budget and signing the Family and Medical Leave Act, his leadership style was not necessarily as 'visionary' or inspiring as the other leaders mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the political leader who could not be termed a 'transformational' leader is (D) Bill Clinton.",

He is known for his work on poverty and social inequality, but he was not an industrialist.\n\n(C) Henry Ford was an industrialist who revolutionized the automobile industry with his mass production techniques. However, he was not particularly known for his philanthropy, despite the fact that he did provide his workers with higher wages than other factories at the time.\n\n(D) Max Weber was a sociologist and philosopher who is known for his work on bureaucracy and the rise of capitalism.
