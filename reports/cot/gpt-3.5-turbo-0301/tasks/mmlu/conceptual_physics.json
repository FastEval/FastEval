            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "We can find the horizontal component of the force by using the cosine of the angle of 45\u00b0. Specifically, we can use the formula:\n\nhorizontal component = force * cos(angle)\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nhorizontal component = 10 N * cos(45\u00b0)\n\nUsing a calculator or reference table, we can find that cos(45\u00b0) is equal to \u221a2 / 2, or approximately 0.707. Substituting this value, we get:\n\nhorizontal component = 10 N * 0.707\n\nMultiplying these values, we get:\n\nhorizontal component = 7.07 N\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 7 N.",

            "model_answer": "According to Archimedes' principle, when an object is submerged in a fluid, it experiences an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. This means that the buoyant force acting on the object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. \n\nTherefore, an object that is completely submerged will displace a volume of fluid equal to its own volume. The weight of this volume of fluid will be equal to the weight of the object, since the two weights are equal according to the principle of conservation of mass. \n\nSo the answer is (B) volume of fluid.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer to this question involves understanding the concept of refraction and the critical angle.\n\nStep 1: When light travels from one medium to another (e.g. from water to air), it changes direction. This is called refraction.\nStep 2: The amount of refraction depends on the angle at which the light hits the surface between the two media (called the angle of incidence) and the refractive indices of the two media.\nStep 3: The refractive index of water is higher than that of air, so light traveling from water into air bends away from the normal (perpendicular) to the surface.\nStep 4: The critical angle is the angle of incidence at which light is refracted at an angle of 90 degrees to the normal. Beyond this angle, light no longer passes into the second medium but is instead totally internally reflected back into the first medium.\nStep 5: To determine whether the beam of light in this scenario will pass into the air or totally internally reflect, we need to compare the angle of incidence (20 degrees) with the critical angle for water-air interface (which can be determined using Snell's law).\nStep 6: Using Snell's law, the critical angle for water-air interface is approximately 49 degrees. Since the angle of incidence in the scenario is less than the critical angle, the beam of light will pass into the air above and not totally internally reflect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) passes into the air above.",

This change in magnetic field can be due to various reasons such as the relative motion of the loop and the magnetic field, changing the strength of the magnetic field, or a time-varying electric current flowing through nearby conductors. Option (B) aligning with the electric field is incorrect because the electric field and magnetic field are perpendicular to each other in electromagnetic waves.
