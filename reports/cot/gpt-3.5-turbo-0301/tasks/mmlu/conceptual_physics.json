            "model_answer": "When a force is applied at an angle, it can be split into its horizontal and vertical components using trigonometry. \n\nThe horizontal component of a force at an angle is given by the formula: \n\nhorizontal component = force * cos(angle)\n\nIn this case, the force is 10 N and the angle is 45\u00b0. \n\nSo, the horizontal component = 10 N * cos(45\u00b0) \n\nUsing a calculator, we find that cos(45\u00b0) is equal to \u221a2/2. \n\nSubstituting this value, we get: \n\nhorizontal component = 10 N * \u221a2/2 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nhorizontal component = 5\u221a2 N \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 5.",

So using the equation E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light, we can find which color has the most energy per photon. \n\n- Red light has the longest wavelength among the options, which means it has the lowest frequency and energy per photon. \n- Yellow-green light has a shorter wavelength than red, so it has a slightly higher frequency and energy per photon. \n- Blue light has an even shorter wavelength than yellow-green, so it has a higher frequency and energy per photon than both red and yellow-green. \n- Violet light has the shortest wavelength among the options, which means it has the highest frequency and energy per photon. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) violet.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) All of these.\n\nGeneral relativity is a theory of gravity developed by Albert Einstein. According to this theory, mass distorts spacetime. This means that objects with mass, like planets and stars, actually bend the fabric of spacetime around them, causing other objects in the vicinity to move towards them.\n\nGravity affects not just objects, but also time. As per Einstein's theory of relativity, time passes more slowly in stronger gravitational fields. Therefore, clocks in stronger gravitational fields will tick slower than clocks in weaker gravitational fields.\n\nBlack holes are objects where the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape from them. Since light cannot escape from within the \"event horizon\" of a black hole, we cannot see or detect anything that falls inside it. Therefore, we call them black holes.\n\nThus, all the statements (A), (B), and (C) are true according to general relativity. Therefore, the answer is (D) All of these.",

The primary coil is connected to the input voltage source, while the secondary coil is connected to the output load. As current flows through the primary coil, it creates a magnetic field that induces voltage in the secondary coil. The ratio of the number of turns in the secondary coil to the number of turns in the primary coil determines the amount of voltage step-up. Therefore, the answer is (A) voltage.",

When these excited electrons return to their original energy levels, they release energy in the form of light. This light is not continuous, but rather composed of distinct lines at specific wavelengths, known as the element's spectral lines. \n\nThese lines are not chaotic, as they occur at predictable and specific wavelengths for each element. They are not positioned by amplitude, as the amplitude of the spectral lines does not carry any information about the element itself. They are also not in phase, as each spectral line represents a unique wavelength that is not synchronized with any other line. \n\nTherefore, the spectral lines of the elements are ordered. \n\nThe answer is (B).",
