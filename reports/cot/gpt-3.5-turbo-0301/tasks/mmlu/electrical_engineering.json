            "model_answer": "First, let's define an oscillator. An oscillator is a circuit that generates a periodic signal without an input signal. Now, let's look at the Barkhausen criterion. \n\nThe criterion states that for an oscillator to work, the loop gain should be equal to 1 and the phase shift around the feedback loop should be an integer multiple of 360 degrees. \n\nThis means that the output signal, when fed back into the input, is in phase with the original input signal. If the loop gain is less than 1, the signal will decay over time, and the circuit will not oscillate. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Both A and C.",

However, when using a potentiometer, the circuit is loaded moderately, meaning that the potentiometer has a high enough resistance to not significantly affect the circuit, but still provides enough current to measure the voltage accurately. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because loading the circuit to its maximum extent would not give an accurate reading and could damage the circuit being measured. Option (C) is incorrect because potentiometer method can use a voltmeter or a centre zero galvanometer. Option (D) is incorrect because the potentiometer does load the circuit to some extent, but it does so moderately and therefore does not significantly affect the circuit being measured.",

            "model_answer": "The firing angle control range refers to the range of the angle \u03b1 at which the thyristor is triggered in each cycle of the AC signal. In order to calculate the firing angle control range, we need to use the equation for the load voltage of a single phase one pulse controlled circuit, which is given by:\n\nV_load = E - I_load * R\n\nIn this equation, I_load is the current flowing through the load, which can be calculated using Ohm's law:\n\nI_load = V_load / R\n\nSubstituting this expression for I_load back into the equation for V_load, we get:\n\nV_load = E - V_load / R * R\nV_load = E - V_load\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nV_load = E / 2\n\nThis means that the load voltage will be half of the counter emf E, since the thyristor only conducts current during the second half of the AC cycle.\n\nNow we can use this expression for V_load to calculate the firing angle control range. When the load counter emf is 200 V, the load voltage is 100 V. In order to calculate the firing angle, we need to use the expression for the waveform of the load voltage:\n\nV_load = V_peak * sin(\u03c9t + \u03b1)\n\nwhere V_peak is the peak voltage of the AC signal, \u03c9 is the angular frequency of the signal, t is time, and \u03b1 is the firing angle.\n\nSince we know that the peak of the sine wave is 400 V, we can solve for \u03b1 at two different points of the waveform where the load voltage is at 100 V:\n\n100 = 400 * sin(\u03c9t + \u03b1)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that the solutions to this equation are:\n\n\u03c9t + \u03b1 = 30\u00b0 and 150\u00b0\n\n\u03c9t + \u03b1 = 210\u00b0 and 330\u00b0\n\nWe only need to consider the first pair of solutions, since the second pair falls outside of the range of possible firing angles. Therefore, the firing angle control range is:\n\n\u03b1 = 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0\n\nThe answer is (A).",

The Gaussian surface encloses no charges, so by Gauss's law, the electric flux through the end caps is zero. \n\nSince the area of the end cap inside the gap is equal to the area of the end cap outside the gap, the magnitude of the electric field between the plates is the same as the electric field due to one plate alone. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) same as that produced by one plate.",
