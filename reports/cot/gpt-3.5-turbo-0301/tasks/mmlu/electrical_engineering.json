            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the Barkhausen criterion for an oscillator. The Barkhausen criterion is a necessary condition for sustained oscillations in an electronic circuit. It states that the loop gain should be unity and the phase shift around the loop should be an integer multiple of 360 degrees.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate option A. Option A states that the loop gain should be unity. This statement is consistent with the Barkhausen criterion.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option B. Option B states that the loop gain should be less than unity. This statement is inconsistent with the Barkhausen criterion.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option C. Option C states that the phase of a feedback signal with respect to the input should be 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0. This statement is also consistent with the Barkhausen criterion.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate option D. Option D states that both A and C are correct. From our analysis in steps 2 and 4, we see that both options A and C are consistent with the Barkhausen criterion. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: D",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A).\n\nThe potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter because it loads the circuit moderately. This helps to minimize any errors caused by the impedance of the voltmeter and other factors that can affect the accuracy of the measurement. By comparison, a direct measurement with a voltmeter can load the circuit to a greater extent, leading to more significant errors in the measurement.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because loading the circuit to the maximum extent would actually decrease the accuracy of the measurement.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because while the potentiometer method does use a centre zero galvanometer, this is not the main reason why it is more accurate.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the potentiometer method does load the circuit, albeit moderately.",

One way to determine if a set of gates is universal is to see if you can create all the other gates using just those gates.\n\nOption A includes NOR and NAND gates. It is known that using just NOR or just NAND gates, you can create all other gates. Therefore, option A is a set of universal gates.\n\nOption B includes XOR, NOR, and NAND gates. While XOR gates are not universal, you can create any gate using just NOR and NAND gates (as shown in option A). Therefore, option B is also a set of universal gates.\n\nOption C includes OR, NOT, and AND gates. While OR and AND gates are very commonly used, they are not considered universal as you cannot create all other gates using just these gates. Therefore, option C is not a set of universal gates.\n\nOption D includes NOR, NAND, and XNOR gates. While NOR and NAND gates are universal (as shown in option A), XNOR gates are not.

            "model_answer": "We know that the firing angle control range depends on the load voltage and the source voltage. In this case, the load voltage is given as 400 sin(314 t), but we need to find the range for a load counter emf of 200 V. To do this, we can simply divide the load voltage by 2, since the counter emf is half the load voltage.\n\nSo, the load counter emf for this problem is 200 V. We also know that the source voltage is given by E = 400 sin(314 t). The firing angle control range is given by:\n\n\u03b8 = cos^-1(1 - Vload/Vsource)\n\nwhere Vload is the load counter emf and Vsource is the source voltage. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n\u03b8 = cos^-1(1 - 200/400)\n\u03b8 = cos^-1(0.5)\n\u03b8 = 60\u00b0\n\nSo, the firing angle control range is 60\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 (D).",

The current through the coil creates an electromagnetic field which interacts with the magnetic field, resulting in a rotational force on the coil.\n\nThe torque produced is proportional to the product of the current and the magnetic field strength. The coil is connected in series with a high resistance, and the voltage drop across this resistance is proportional to the current, allowing the power to be measured.\n\nTherefore, the resistance in the circuit of the moving coil of a dynamometer wattmeter should be almost zero to ensure minimal voltage drop across the coil and to achieve high sensitivity.
