            "model_answer": "As an AI language model, I do not have the expertise to provide professional opinions and advice in the domain of auditing. However, I can explain the meanings of the given statements.\n\n(A) Nonsampling risk refers to the risk that the auditor reaches the wrong conclusion despite performing the audit procedures correctly. This risk is not related to the sample size but arises from factors such as reliance on management representations, ineffective audit procedures, or misinterpretation of audit findings. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n(B) This statement is referring to detection risk, which is the risk that the auditor fails to detect a material misstatement in the financial statements. Detection risk can arise from a lack of understanding of the client's business or industry, inadequate testing, or misinterpretation of evidence. Nonsampling risk is a broader concept that includes detection risk as well as other risks that affect the audit conclusion. Therefore, this statement is partially correct.\n\n(C) Sampling risk is the risk that the auditor's conclusion based on a sample may be different from the conclusion that would be reached if the auditor tested the entire population. This risk arises from the fact that a sample is only a subset of the population and may not be fully representative. The statement correctly describes the source of sampling risk.\n\n(D) This statement is also correct. Sampling risk can arise from selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate for the specific objective, such as using a less efficient or effective sampling technique, failing to follow the sampling plan, or using a sample size that is too small.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C).",

Calculate the total value of all coupon payments over the life of the bond: $5 x 3 = $15. \n\n3. Calculate the present value of the coupon payments using the formula: coupon payment / (1 + yield)^n, where n is the number of periods until the payment is received. \n- For the first coupon payment received in one year: $5 / (1 + 0.06)^1 = $4.72 \n- For the second coupon payment received in two years: $5 / (1 + 0.06)^2 = $4.46 \n- For the third coupon payment received in three years: $5 / (1 + 0.06)^3 = $4.21 \n\n4.

            "model_answer": "First, we need to calculate how much of the taxable income of the C corporation is allocated to Carson.
