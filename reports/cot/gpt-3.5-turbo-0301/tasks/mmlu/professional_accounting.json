If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",

            "model_answer": "Firstly, let's calculate the daily revenue: \n2 hours * $245 per hour = $490\nNow let's calculate the daily profit: \n$490 - $50 (daily costs) = $440\nSince the limousine will be rented every day of the year, the annual revenue will be:\n365 days * $490 = $178,850 \nThe annual profit will be: \n365 days * $440 = $160,600 \nTo calculate the estimated yield, we divide the profit by the initial investment and multiply by 100 to get a percentage: \n($160,600/$98,000) * 100 = 164% \nTherefore, the answer is (A) 164%.",

            "model_answer": "If the credit purchase of merchandise was not recorded, it means the accounts payable and the inventory accounts were not affected. However, since the merchandise was included in the physical inventory, the inventory balance was higher than what was recorded in the accounting records. This results in an understatement of the inventory account, which is considered an asset. Therefore, the balance sheet is understated in assets. The omission does not affect liabilities.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, it is important to understand the terms. Audit sampling is the process of selecting a subset of data from the entire population of data to reach conclusions about the entire population. There are two types of risks associated with audit sampling: sampling risk and nonsampling risk.\n\nSampling risk is the risk that the auditor's conclusion based on the sample may be different from the conclusion they would have reached if they had tested the entire population. This risk arises because the auditor is only testing a sample, not the entire population.\n\nNonsampling risk is the risk that the auditor will not detect a material misstatement even though they have performed the audit correctly. This risk can arise due to a number of factors, such as errors in judgment or failure to recognize misstatements.\n\nFor nonissuers, the correct statement about audit sampling risks is (B) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements. This is because when auditing nonissuers, the risk of incorrect conclusions due to a sample is generally lower compared to sampling risk for issuers. Therefore, nonsampling risk is the more significant risk to consider.",

These events may require adjustment to the financial statements or disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. An auditor would generally perform procedures to identify subsequent events and evaluate their impact on the financial statements. \n\nOption (A) is related to cutoff testing and may be performed during the audit, but it is not specifically related to subsequent events. \n\nOption (B) is related to testing internal controls, which is a separate audit objective. \n\nOption (C) is related to bank reconciliations and cutoff testing and may be performed during the audit, but it is not specifically related to subsequent events. \n\nOption (D) is the correct answer as the comparison of the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited can help identify subsequent events that may require adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.

Therefore, using the straight-line method to amortize the premium would result in lower interest expense and higher net income in the earlier years of the bond's life, and higher interest expense and lower net income in the later years. \n\nSince the error was made at June 30 year 12, this means that the bond would have been fully amortized by July 1 year 12 and the carrying value would be the face value of the bond. Therefore, at June 30 year 12, there would be no difference in the carrying value of the bond whether the straight-line or effective interest method was used. \n\nHowever, since the straight-line method would have resulted in lower interest expense and higher net income in the earlier years, retained earnings would be overstated at June 30 year 12. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Overstated Understated.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the price of a three-year bond with a face value of $100, paying 5% coupons and a yield of 6%, we follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the semi-annual coupon payment. Since the coupon rate is annual, we divide it by 2 to get the semi-annual coupon rate: 5% / 2 = 2.5%. The semi-annual coupon payment is therefore $100 x 2.5% = $2.50.\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate the number of coupon payments over the life of the bond. Since the bond has a maturity of three years and pays coupons semi-annually, there are 6 coupon payments: 3 years x 2 semi-annual periods per year = 6.\n\n3. We can now calculate the present value of the bond's cash flows. To do this, we need to discount each semi-annual coupon payment and the face value by the semi-annual yield to maturity. The yield to maturity is 6%/2 = 3% per semi-annual period. Using the formula for the present value of an annuity, we get:\n\nPV of coupon payments = $2.50 x [1 - (1 + 3%)^-6] / (3%) = $12.96\nPV of face value = $100 / (1 + 3%)^6 = $83.70\nTotal PV = $12.96 + $83.70 = $96.66\n\n4. Finally, we round the price to the nearest cent. The closest answer choice is (C) $96.71.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",
