            "model_answer": "For a rapid blood transfusion, you would want to use a larger cannula to allow for a faster flow rate. Smaller cannulas may cause hemolysis or damage to the blood cells. \n\nThe most commonly used cannula size for a rapid blood transfusion is 18 gauge. This size allows for a flow rate of approximately 200-300 mL/min. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 18 gauge.",

Strength and power may be important for short bursts of speed, but they are not as crucial for marathon running.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A).\n\nDuring high-intensity exercise, the body relies heavily on anaerobic metabolism to produce energy. As the intensity of exercise increases and longer sprints are performed, the body's reliance on anaerobic metabolism progressively increases due to the limited oxygen supply to the muscles. This leads to an accumulation of lactic acid, which contributes to the decrease in pH of the muscle. However, the blood glucose concentration does not necessarily fall below 3 mmol/L during sprints. While the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism may increase slightly during longer sprints due to the body's attempt to meet the energy demands, it is still the anaerobic system that primarily contributes to energy production. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) anaerobic contribution progressively increases.",

Option B is not always true as the false image can be either the outer or inner image depending on the cause of the diplopia. Option D is also incorrect as a sixth nerve palsy causes a convergent squint.\n\nStep 3: Consider option C\nA fourth nerve palsy affects the superior oblique muscle, which is responsible for downward and outward eye movement.
