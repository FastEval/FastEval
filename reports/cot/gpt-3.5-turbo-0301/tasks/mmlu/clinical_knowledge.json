            "model_answer": "When administering a blood transfusion, a larger bore cannula is required to allow for the rapid flow of blood. A smaller bore cannula can cause hemolysis (the breaking down of red blood cells) and clotting, which can be dangerous for the patient. \n\nTypically, an 18 gauge cannula is used for rapid blood transfusions. This size allows for a large enough bore to accommodate the flow of blood without causing hemolysis or clotting. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 18 gauge.",

            "model_answer": "Dementia is a medical condition characterized by the decline of cognitive abilities, including memory impairment, reasoning, and communication skills. There are several types of dementia, and they can have different causes. The question asks for the commonest cause of dementia in the UK among four options: Alzheimer's disease, Cerebrovascular (stroke) disease, Lewy body dementia, and HIV infection. \n\n(A) Alzheimer's disease is a type of dementia that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is caused by the irregular functioning and loss of brain cells. According to the Alzheimer's Society, Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK. \n\n(B) Cerebrovascular disease refers to a group of medical conditions that affect the blood vessels in the brain and can lead to strokes. Strokes can cause brain damage and cognitive impairment, and may lead to vascular dementia, which is a type of dementia caused by reduced blood flow to the brain. While stroke and vascular dementia are common conditions, they are not the commonest cause of dementia in the UK.\n\n(C) Lewy body dementia is a type of dementia that shares symptoms with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, including memory loss and movement problems. It is caused by the buildup of abnormal protein deposits in the brain. Lewy body dementia is not as common as Alzheimer's disease, and it is not the commonest cause of dementia in the UK.\n\n(D) HIV infection is a viral infection that attacks the immune system. While HIV can affect brain function, it is not a common cause of dementia in the UK.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Alzheimer's disease.",

            "model_answer": "Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. Symptoms can include difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, hives or rash, and others.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to determine which of the symptoms listed is NOT characteristic of anaphylaxis.\n\nA. Stridor is a high-pitched wheezing sound that occurs when there is a blockage or narrowing of the airways, and it can be a symptom of anaphylaxis. \n\nB. Bradycardia is a slow heartbeat, which is not typically associated with anaphylaxis. \n\nC. Severe wheeze is a common symptom of anaphylaxis as there may be constriction or blockage in the airway. \n\nD. Rash is one of the symptoms of anaphylaxis that can appear with hives.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Bradycardia.",

Based on this information, option (A) can be eliminated as it describes a semi-formed or liquid output. Option (B) is a possibility as patients with colostomies may have a formed stool output. However, more information is needed to determine if closed pouches are always used in this situation. Option (C) may be true in some cases, but it is not a definitive reason for using a closed pouch. Option (D) can be eliminated as closed pouches are not typically used for patients with urostomies. Therefore, the answer is (B).",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "With an increasing number of sprints, there is a higher demand for energy production. The initial source of energy is ATP, followed by the breakdown of phosphocreatine. These two sources provide immediate energy without the need for oxygen. As the sprints continue, the body starts to rely more on anaerobic metabolism, specifically glycolysis. Glycolysis breaks down glucose without the need for oxygen and produces lactic acid as a byproduct. Lactic acid makes the muscle environment more acidic, lowering the pH. This environment eventually reaches a point where glycolysis can no longer function effectively. At this point, the body will start to rely more on aerobic metabolism, which requires oxygen and breaks down glucose into carbon dioxide and water. Therefore, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases with an increasing number of sprints. The answer is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Option A is incorrect because diplopia can occur even if one eye is covered. This is because diplopia is caused by an imbalance in the eye muscles and not by the fact that both eyes are open. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the false image can be either the outer or the inner image depending on the cause of diplopia. \n\nOption C is partially correct because a fourth nerve palsy can cause diplopia specifically when the affected eye looks downwards and slightly outwards, not upwards. \n\nOption D is correct because a sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint, also known as an outward deviation of the affected eye, which can result in diplopia. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",

            "model_answer": "Sodium bicarbonate acts as a buffer that can neutralize excess acid in the body, including the buildup of hydrogen ions that occurs during exercise. This suggests that the answer is either (A) or (C), since both involve elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid. However, we need to consider which effect would actually improve running performance. In this case, we are looking for a faster removal of hydrogen ions from muscle, which would reduce the muscle fatigue and allow for greater endurance.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Fatty acids need to be transported into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation to occur. The first step in this process is the formation of fatty acyl CoA, which occurs in the cytosol. This requires the activation of the fatty acid through the use of ATP by an enzyme called acyl-CoA synthetase. \n\nThe fatty acyl CoA cannot directly cross the mitochondrial membrane, so it must be transported across via a shuttle system. This shuttle system involves the formation of a fatty acyl carnitine molecule, which is able to cross the membrane via a specific transporter. \n\nOnce inside the mitochondria, the carnitine is then removed from the fatty acid and replaced with a CoA molecule. This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) carnitine.",
