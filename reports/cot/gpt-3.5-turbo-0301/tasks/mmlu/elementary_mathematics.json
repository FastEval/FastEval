Since 0.06 can go into 2 thirty-three times (0.06 x 33 = 1.98), we write 33 above the 6:\n\n```\n    0.06 | 2.16\n     0.06|     \n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n```\n\nWe then multiply 0.06 by 33 to get 1.98 and write it below the 2.16:\n\n```\n    0.06 | 2.16\n     0.06| 1.98\n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n```\n\nWe subtract 1.98 from 2.16 to get 0.18:\n\n```\n    0.06 | 2.16\n     0.06| 1.98\n         | -----\n         | 0.18\n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n```\n\nWe bring down the next digit (which is 6) and see how many times 0.06 goes into 0.18. It can go in three times (0.06 x 3 = 0.18), so we write 3 next to the 33:\n\n```\n    0.06 | 2.16\n     0.06| 1.98\n         | -----\n         | 0.18\n     0.06|     \n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n```\n\nWe then multiply 0.06 by 3 to get 0.18 and write it below the 0.18:\n\n```\n    0.06 | 2.16\n     0.06| 1.98\n         | -----\n         | 0.18\n     0.06| 0.18\n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n         |     \n```\n\nWe subtract 0.18 from 0.18 to get 0, which means we are done:\n\n```\n    0.06 | 2.16\n     0.06| 1.98\n         | -----\n         | 0.18\n     0.06| 0.18\n         | -----\n         | 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the quotient of 2.16 \u00f7 0.06 is 36.
