            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The term \"murtis\" is commonly used in Hinduism to refer to physical representations of deities. These representations can be in various forms, including statues or images. To determine the most accurate translation for \"murtis,\" we can examine the cultural and religious context in which the term is used. \n\nOption (A), \"offerings,\" is not an accurate translation for \"murtis,\" as the term specifically refers to the physical representation of a deity and not something offered to the deity. \n\nOption (B), \"prayers,\" is also not an accurate translation for \"murtis,\" as the term does not have any inherent association with prayer. \n\nOption (C), \"apparitions,\" does not accurately capture the meaning of \"murtis,\" as it implies a sense of visibility or manifestation that may not be present in every use of the term. \n\nOption (D), \"idols,\" is the most accurate translation for \"murtis,\" as it acknowledges the physical representation aspect of the term while also recognizing the controversial nature of such representations in some religious contexts. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Idols.",

The Yin-Yang School, while related to Daoism, is specifically focused on the balance of opposing forces and may not necessarily have a focus on natural elements and processes.\n4. Mengzi is a Confucian philosopher who emphasized the importance of human nature and morality, so he is unlikely to be associated with naturalists who concentrate on natural elements and processes.\n5.
