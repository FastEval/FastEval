Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands.

The question asks for an example of nativism, which is the belief in the superiority of native-born people and a desire to limit the influence of immigrants. Therefore, we should look for a legislative act that aims to restrict immigration or promote the interests of native-born Americans. \n\n(A) The Wagner Act of 1935 is not an example of nativism. It was a labor law that protected workers' right to form unions and engage in collective bargaining. \n\n(B) The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 were a series of four laws that aimed to limit the activities of foreigners in the United States and suppress political dissent. They were a response to fears of war with France and the influence of French immigrants in American politics. These acts could be viewed as an example of nativism because they favored native-born Americans and restricted the rights of immigrants. \n\n(C) The Espionage Act of 1917 was a law that made it a crime to interfere with military operations, promote mutiny or insubordination in the armed forces, or obstruct military recruitment. This act was not related to immigration, so it is not an example of nativism. \n\n(D) The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 abolished the national origins quota system that favored immigrants from western and northern Europe and restricted immigration from other parts of the world. This act was a significant liberalization of U.S. immigration policy and aimed to promote family reunification and attract highly skilled workers.
