As the object slides down the incline, it loses potential energy due to a decrease in height. This potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. However, the incline is described as having a rough surface, so there must be frictional forces acting on the object as it slides down. These frictional forces will work to convert some of the mechanical energy of the object into thermal energy, which means that the object will not have as much kinetic energy at the bottom of the incline as it would if there were no friction.
