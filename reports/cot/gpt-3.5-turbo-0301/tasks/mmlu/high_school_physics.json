            "model_answer": "The formula for capacitance is C = Q/V, where C is capacitance, Q is charge, and V is potential difference.\n\nRearranging this formula gives Q = CV, which can be used to find the charge on the positive plate.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get Q = (2 mF)(5 V) = 10 mC.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the charge on the positive plate only, not the total charge. Since the potential difference is positive, we know that the positive plate has more potential energy than the negative plate, which means it has a greater charge. Thus, the answer is greater than half of the total charge, which would be 5 mC.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 0.02 C.",

            "model_answer": "The key idea at play in this problem is the balance of forces that keeps the small block from sliding off the larger block. When the spring-block system is at maximum displacement from equilibrium, there is tension in the spring and the force from the small block pressing down on the large block is at a maximum. At the equilibrium position, there is no tension in the spring and the force from the small block is at a minimum. The force of friction between the blocks must be greater than the force from the small block in order to prevent it from sliding off.\n\nTo determine which answer choice is correct, we need to find the condition under which the force of friction is sufficient to keep the small block in place. Let's start with the equations of motion for the combined block and small block system:\n\nm(M+m)x'' = -kx - mg - Ff\n\nwhere x is the displacement of the combined system from equilibrium, x'' is its second derivative with respect to time, Ff is the force of static friction between the blocks, and we have assumed that the small block is not slipping on top of the larger block (otherwise there would be kinetic friction).\n\nAt maximum displacement, x = A, and we can say that x'' = -(k/(M+m))A. Plugging these values in, we get:\n\nm(M+m)(-k/(M+m))A = -kA - mg - Ff\n\nSimplifying, we find that the force of friction required to balance the forces at maximum displacement is:\n\nFf = (M+m)g - kA\n\nAt the equilibrium position, x = 0, and we can say that x'' = 0. Plugging these values in, we get:\n\n0 = -mg - Ff\n\nSolving for Ff, we find that the force of friction required to balance the forces at equilibrium is:\n\nFf = -mg\n\nSo the condition for the small block not to slide off is that the force of friction is greater than or equal to these values at every point in the motion of the spring-block system. Plugging in the expressions we derived for Ff at maximum displacement and at equilibrium, we find:\n\nFf >= (M+m)g - kA   (at maximum displacement)\nFf >= -mg   (at equilibrium)\n\nWe can simplify the first condition using the fact that A/k is the period of oscillation of the spring-block system:\n\nFf >= (M+m)g - (m/k)(kA) = (M+m)g - mA/(M+m)\n\nWe can now compare this to the answer choices. Choice A is incorrect because it has the wrong inequality (it should be greater than or equal to, not just greater than). Choice C is incorrect because it has the wrong combination of variables - the denominator should be (M+m) not kA. That leaves choices B and D, which have the correct combination of variables and inequality but different signs. We can eliminate choice B by plugging in some numbers: if the coefficient of static friction were equal to kA/[(M+m)g], then the force of friction would only be kA and would not be sufficient to balance the forces at the equilibrium position. Therefore the correct answer is (D).",
