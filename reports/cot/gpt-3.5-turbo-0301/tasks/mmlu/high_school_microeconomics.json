            "model_answer": "Marginal revenue is the additional revenue gained from producing one more unit. Marginal cost is the additional cost incurred from producing one more unit. \n\nTo find the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, we need to compare the change in revenue from producing one more unit with the change in cost from producing one more unit. If the change in revenue is larger than the change in cost, then producing one more unit will increase profit. If the change in cost is larger than the change in revenue, then producing one more unit will decrease profit.\n\nOption (A) mentions \"total revenue\" and \"total cost\" but these do not directly relate to the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. \n\nOption (B) is closer to the concept we need, but it refers to total revenue being equal to total cost which is not the same as the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. \n\nOption (C) mentions marginal product being at its highest point but this is not directly related to marginal revenue or marginal cost. \n\nOption (D) mentions total product being at its highest point, but this too is not directly related to marginal revenue or marginal cost. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B).",

Currently, the marginal product per dollar of labor is 100 (200/2) and for capital, it is 50.

            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n- An externality is a cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. \n- This means that there is a third-party involved in a transaction between two other parties (buyer and seller). \n- The third-party can either be positively or negatively affected by the transaction. \n- If the third-party is negatively affected (e.g. pollution), then the cost to society is greater than the cost to the buyer and seller alone. \n- If the third-party is positively affected (e.g. education), then the benefit to society is greater than the benefit to the buyer and seller alone. \n- In both cases, the equilibrium price that the buyer and seller agree upon is not the socially optimal price. \n- In the case of a negative externality, the equilibrium price is artificially low, meaning that the price does not reflect the true cost to society. \n- In the case of a positive externality, the equilibrium price is artificially high, meaning that the price does not reflect the true benefit to society. \n- Therefore, the answer is (D). \n\nAnswer: D",

This can lead to a number of negative consequences, which is why the government discourages collusion. One reason is that collusive output levels tend to decrease or increase (depending on the type of collusion) which can drive the price up or down to non-competitive levels.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "When rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase, it means that the demand for the oligopolist's product is highly dependent on the prices set by its rivals. If the oligopolist increases its price, the demand for its product will decrease significantly as consumers switch to its lower-priced rivals. However, if the oligopolist decreases its price, its rivals are likely to follow suit, and the oligopolist will not gain many new customers because its product is still relatively more expensive than its rivals.\n\nThis scenario is best represented by a highly elastic demand curve. An elastic demand curve means that a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity demanded. In this case, if the oligopolist raises its price even slightly, consumers will switch to its rivals and the oligopolist will lose a significant portion of its market share. On the other hand, if the oligopolist lowers its price, it will not gain many new customers because its rivals are also lowering their prices. Therefore, the demand curve facing the oligopolist is highly elastic.\n\nAnswer: (C)",

Control of resources such as raw materials or key suppliers can limit the ability of new firms to acquire what they need to enter the market. Economies of scale can make it prohibitively expensive for new firms to achieve the same level of efficiency as established firms, while exclusive licenses can limit the availability of technologies or products to competitors. \n\nTherefore, all of these factors are barriers to entry. \n\nThe answer is (D).",
