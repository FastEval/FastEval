            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Marginal revenue is the additional revenue earned from producing one additional unit of output. Marginal cost is the additional cost incurred from producing one additional unit of output. \n\nWhen marginal revenue equals marginal cost, it means that the last unit produced is adding the same amount of revenue as it is costing to produce it. This is the point of profit maximization for a firm. \n\nOption (B) states that total revenue is equal to total cost. This could be true, but it doesn't necessarily mean that marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The firm could be producing at a point where it is earning zero profit. \n\nOption (C) states that marginal product is at its highest point. Marginal product measures the increase in output resulting from an additional unit of input. While high marginal product can lead to higher profits, it doesn't necessarily mean that marginal revenue and marginal cost are equal. \n\nOption (D) states that total product is at its highest point. Total product is the total output produced by a firm. Again, while high total product can lead to higher profits, it doesn't necessarily mean that the firm is producing at the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance. This is because the difference between total revenue and total cost is the highest at this point, indicating maximum profit for the firm. At this point, marginal revenue equals marginal cost and the firm is producing at the point of profit maximization.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The firm should aim to maximize its total production while minimizing its costs. In this case, the marginal product of labor and capital indicate the additional production gained from each additional unit of input. As the price of labor is higher than the price of capital, the firm should strive to use less labor and more capital to produce the same amount. Therefore, the optimal decision is to decrease labor and increase capital. However, we also need to consider the effect on marginal product. If the marginal product of capital rises as a result of this decision, while the marginal product of labor falls, then it would be beneficial. Therefore, the answer is (B) Increase capital and decrease labor so that the marginal product of capital rises and the marginal product of labor falls.",

            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\nAn externality is a cost or benefit that affects a third party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. This means that the market price does not reflect the full societal cost or benefit of the good or service being exchanged.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because if the externality causes the equilibrium price to be artificially high, it means that the cost to society is too high, which is not a benefit. This contradicts the definition of externality, which includes costs and benefits.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because if the externality causes the equilibrium price to be artificially low, it means that the benefit to society is too high, which is not a cost. Again, this contradicts the definition of externality.\n\nOption (C) is not necessarily true because markets can still reach equilibrium even with externalities. However, the equilibrium price and quantity will not reflect the full societal cost or benefit, and thus the market outcome may be suboptimal.\n\nOption (D) is correct because externalities lead to a difference between the private cost or benefit to the individuals involved in the transaction and the total social cost or benefit to society as a whole. As a result, the market outcome will not maximize the total benefit to society.\n\nAnswer: D",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "When rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase, it means that the oligopolist has some market power and can influence the price to some extent. However, if they increase the price, the rivals will not follow suit and the oligopolist will lose market share. This implies that the demand curve is more elastic when the oligopolist increases the price compared to when they decrease the price. Therefore, the demand curve facing the oligopolist is likely to be less elastic when the price is lowered by the oligopolist and rivals follow suit. Option (B) can be ruled out because a highly inelastic demand curve would mean that the oligopolist can increase the price without losing much market share. Option (A) can also be ruled out because a perfectly horizontal demand curve would mean that the oligopolist has no market power and has to accept the market price. Option (D) is unlikely because the demand curve is usually continuous. Therefore, the answer is (C) highly elastic demand curve.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Let's interpret the information given. The industry that makes plastic army figures uses only a small fraction of plastic demanded for all purposes. This means that the plastic used by the army-figures industry is a very small percentage of the total plastic demanded for all purposes.\n\nStep 2: Based on the interpretation, we need to determine what type of industry the army-figures industry is most likely to be. There are three types of industries - increasing-cost, constant-cost, and decreasing-cost.\n\nStep 3: An increasing-cost industry is one in which the cost of production increases as output increases. For example, if the army-figures industry were an increasing-cost industry, then the cost of making each individual figure would increase as more and more figures were produced. This would be because the demand for plastic would increase, driving up the cost of plastic.\n\nStep 4: A constant-cost industry is one in which the cost of production remains the same regardless of output. For example, if the army-figures industry were a constant-cost industry, then the cost of making each individual figure would remain the same no matter how many figures were produced. This would be because the army-figures industry only uses a small fraction of plastic, and so the demand for plastic would not increase significantly with increased production.\n\nStep 5: A decreasing-cost industry is one in which the cost of production decreases as output increases. For example, if the army-figures industry were a decreasing-cost industry, then the cost of making each individual figure would decrease as more and more figures were produced. This would be because the demand for plastic would increase, but the increased demand would result in lower prices for plastic.\n\nStep 6: Based on the interpretation in Step 1, we can conclude that the army-figures industry is most likely a constant-cost industry. This is because the army-figures industry only uses a small fraction of plastic, and so the cost of plastic would not increase significantly with increased production. Therefore, the cost of making each individual figure would remain the same regardless of how many figures were produced.\n\nAnswer: (B)",
