            "model_answer": "The stylomastoid foramen is a small opening in the skull base that the facial nerve passes through as it exits the skull. If there is compression of the facial nerve at this location, it will affect the function of the nerve. The facial nerve is responsible for controlling the muscles of facial expression, taste sensation on the anterior 2/3 of the tongue, and lacrimation (tear production) and salivation (secretion of saliva) from the submandibular and sublingual glands. \n\nTherefore, a lesion causing compression of the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen will cause ipsilateral (meaning on the same side as the lesion):\n(A) paralysis of the facial muscles. \n\nAnswer: A",

            "question": "A \"dished face\" profile is often associated with\n\n(A) a protruding mandible due to reactivation of the condylar cartilage by acromegaly.\n(B) a recessive maxilla due to failure of elongation of the cranial base.\n(C) an enlarged frontal bone due to hydrocephaly.\n(D) defective development of the maxillary air sinus.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what a \"dished face\" profile looks like. This refers to a facial structure with a concave shape from the forehead to the nose to the upper lip. \n\nOption (A) suggests that a protruding mandible is responsible for a dished face profile. However, this would create a convex (not concave) shape in the lower part of the face, which is opposite to a dished face appearance. \n\nOption (B) proposes a recessive maxilla as the cause. The maxilla is the upper jaw bone, and a recessed maxilla would create a concave appearance in the mid-face region, which is consistent with a dished face profile.\n\nOption (C) suggests an enlarged frontal bone, which refers to the forehead. While a larger forehead can contribute to a dished face appearance, it is not the primary cause.\n\nOption (D) proposes defective development of the maxillary air sinus. The maxillary sinuses are the air-filled spaces located in the cheeks. Defective development of these sinuses could potentially cause a concave appearance in the mid-face area and contribute to a dished face profile.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B).",

Hair in the nose can help to filter out larger particles, but it is not the main defense mechanism. Osteoblasts are cells involved in bone formation and are not directly related to the defense against bacteria. Saliva contains enzymes that can kill some bacteria, but it is not the main defense mechanism either. The primary defense mechanism against environmental bacteria is the mucous membranes. These membranes line various parts of the body, including the respiratory, digestive, and urinary tracts, and produce mucus to trap and expel bacteria.

During embryonic development, they start out as soft tissue that is separated by a groove called the primary palate. The primary palate is formed during the fourth week of gestation, and the palatine processes begin to form around the same time. \n\nAround the sixth week of gestation, the palatine processes start to move towards the midline of the embryo, where they will eventually fuse with each other. This is a crucial step in the development of the palate, as it is necessary for the closure of the oral cavity and the separation of the nasal and oral cavities. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) six weeks post-fertilization.",
