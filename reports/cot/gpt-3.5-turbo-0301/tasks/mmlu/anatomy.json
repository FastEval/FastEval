            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The stylomastoid foramen is the bony canal through which the facial nerve exits the skull. Any lesion causing compression of the facial nerve at this point would affect the function of the nerve. The facial nerve innervates the muscles of facial expression, affects taste sensation in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and controls the lacrimation and salivation functions of the lacrimal and salivary glands respectively.\n\nTherefore, a lesion causing compression of the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen would result in ipsilateral (meaning on the same side as the lesion):\n\n(A) paralysis of the facial muscles. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

            "question": "A \"dished face\" profile is often associated with\n\n(A) a protruding mandible due to reactivation of the condylar cartilage by acromegaly.\n(B) a recessive maxilla due to failure of elongation of the cranial base.\n(C) an enlarged frontal bone due to hydrocephaly.\n(D) defective development of the maxillary air sinus.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what a \"dished face\" profile means. This term refers to a facial profile where the forehead and upper third of the face are recessed compared to the midface and lower third of the face. \n\nOption (A) states that a dished face profile may be due to a protruding mandible caused by acromegaly. However, acromegaly is a condition where there is an overproduction of growth hormone, which causes enlargement of the bones of the hands, feet, and face. While acromegaly may cause a protruding mandible, it would not cause a dished face profile since the overall effect of the enlarged bones would be a more prominent and protruding facial structure.\n\nOption (B) suggests that a recessive maxilla due to failure of elongation of the cranial base may cause a dished face profile. The maxilla is the upper jawbone, and a recessive maxilla means that it appears to be pulled backward in relation to the rest of the face. This relative retraction of the maxilla can indeed cause a dished face profile.\n\nOption (C) states that an enlarged frontal bone due to hydrocephaly may cause a dished face profile. However, hydrocephaly is a condition where there is an excess of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, which causes enlargement of the brain and skull. Enlargement of the frontal bone alone would not cause a dished face profile since the midface and lower third of the face would not be affected.\n\nOption (D) suggests that defective development of the maxillary air sinus may cause a dished face profile. The maxillary air sinuses are located in the maxilla and are one of the largest sinuses in the skull. Defective development of the maxillary air sinus may indeed cause a recession of the maxilla, which can cause a dished face profile.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) a recessive maxilla due to failure of elongation of the cranial base.",

            "model_answer": "The human body has a variety of defense mechanisms against bacterial infections. The options given are hair in the nose, mucous membranes, osteoblasts, and saliva.\n\nHair in the nose is an important physical barrier that prevents large particles and organisms from entering the respiratory system. However, it is not very effective against smaller bacteria, which can easily pass through.\n\nMucous membranes, on the other hand, are an important line of defense against bacterial infections. They are found throughout the body, including in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems, and produce mucus that can trap and prevent bacteria from entering the body.\n\nOsteoblasts, which are cells that produce bone tissue, are not directly involved in the body's defense against bacteria.\n\nSaliva also has some antibacterial properties, but it is mainly involved in breaking down food during digestion and does not play a major role in the body's defense against environmental bacteria.\n\nTherefore, the best answer to this question is (B) Mucous membranes.",

            "model_answer": "In embryonic development, the palatine processes are structures that form the hard palate of the mouth. The hard palate separates the oral and nasal cavities. The hard palate forms from two palatine processes that grow and fuse in the midline. \n\nDuring embryonic development, the palatine processes begin to form at around the 6th week post-fertilization. However, it takes some time for them to fully fuse in the midline and form the hard palate. \n\nBased on this information, we can eliminate option (A) because the palatine processes are just beginning to form at that point. Option (B) is possible but seems too early for them to have fully fused. Option (D) is also possible but seems a bit late for the processes to still be fusing. \n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is (C) ten weeks post-fertilization, as this is a reasonable amount of time for the palatine processes to have fully fused and formed the hard palate. \n\nAnswer: (C)",
