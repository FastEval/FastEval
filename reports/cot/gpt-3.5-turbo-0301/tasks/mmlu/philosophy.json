            "model_answer": "The word \"aesthetics\" refers to the study of beauty and taste in art or design. Therefore, the objects that aesthetics deals with are likely related to art or design, rather than necessities for human survival. Option (A), objects essential to our existence, is not likely the correct answer. Option (B), objects unimportant to most people, may be true in some cases, but it is not a defining characteristic of the objects aesthetics deals with. Option (D), objects rarely viewed, is also unlikely, as an object's popularity or frequency of viewing does not determine its aesthetic value. Therefore, the best answer is (C) not essential to our existence.",

According to Plato, true beauty is not found in everyday objects, as they are changeable and imperfect. He also does not believe that beauty is nonexistent or everywhere in the natural world, as that would imply that beauty is subjective and varies from person to person.\n\nInstead, Plato argues that true beauty is not of this world, and is instead found in the realm of ideas or forms. Beauty is a universal and eternal concept that can only be understood through philosophy and contemplation. Therefore, the answer is (D) not of this world.",

It is when a person acts against their better judgment, especially in regards to their desires or passions. \n\nOption (A), \"one does not know that one\u2019s actions are wrong,\" does not capture the essence of incontinence. Incontinence involves knowing what is right but being unable to act on it.\n\nOption (C), \"one knows that one\u2019s feelings are inappropriate, and does not act on them,\" is not correct either. Incontinence is about failing to act on what one knows is right, not about suppressing or ignoring one's feelings.\n\nOption (D), \"one does the right action, but for the wrong reason,\" is a concept that is related but distinct from incontinence. This is known as acting in accordance with akratic beliefs, or having the correct action-guiding beliefs but failing to act on them.\n\nOption (B), \"one knows that one\u2019s actions are wrong, but does them anyway,\" is the correct answer.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what Nagel means by \"skeptical arguments.\" Nagel is likely referring to arguments that call into question commonly held beliefs or assumptions.\n\nNext, we need to examine each answer choice and determine which one best aligns with Nagel's view. \n\nAnswer choice (A) suggests that skeptics apply overly strict standards to their arguments, which could make it difficult for them to prove their point. This answer choice doesn't seem to fully capture Nagel's view, as he is more concerned with the logical foundations of skeptical arguments rather than the difficulty of proving them.\n\nAnswer choice (B) argues that many skeptical arguments are ultimately based on misunderstandings or confusions in language. While this may be a factor in some cases, it doesn't seem to be the root of the problem for Nagel. \n\nAnswer choice (C) suggests that skeptical arguments are logically self-defeating, meaning that they contradict themselves or rely on assumptions that also undermine their conclusion. This answer choice comes closer to Nagel's view that many skeptical arguments are flawed on a fundamental level.\n\nFinally, answer choice (D) proposes that skeptical arguments grow out of the consistent application of ordinary standards. This seems to be the opposite of what Nagel is arguing - that skeptical arguments often challenge or undermine these ordinary standards. \n\nOverall, answer choice (C) seems to best capture Nagel's position on skeptical arguments. He believes that many of these arguments fall apart because of logical inconsistencies or assumptions that undermine their own conclusions. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: C",

This means that our actions should not only take into account our own interests, but also those of other beings that can experience pleasure and pain.\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that Singer would suggest that compliance with his principle requires (A) modest changes to our personal habits, but not to our society as a whole. This is because it is difficult to imagine how personal changes alone could significantly reduce suffering and increase well-being for all sentient beings.\n\nOption (B) modest changes to our personal habits, as well as to society, is more likely to be correct. Singer has argued that we need to challenge societal norms and practices that perpetuate speciesism and exploitation of animals, and that this requires collective action and systemic change. However, he also emphasizes that individual actions matter and can have a significant impact, especially in terms of reducing demand for animal products and influencing social norms.\n\nOption (C) drastic changes to our personal habits, but not to our society, seems unlikely as well, as it is difficult to see how individual changes alone could lead to the kind of systemic change that Singer advocates for.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is (B) modest changes to our personal habits, as well as to society.",
