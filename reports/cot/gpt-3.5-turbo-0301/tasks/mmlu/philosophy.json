            "model_answer": "The word \"aesthetics\" is derived from the Greek word \"aisth\u0113sis,\" which means sensation or perception. Aesthetics is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of beauty, art, and taste, and how we perceive and appreciate them. Based on this definition, it is clear that aesthetics deals with objects or experiences that are related to beauty, art, and taste.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because aesthetics is not concerned with objects that are essential to our existence, such as food, water, and shelter. Option (B) is incorrect because aesthetics deals with objects that are considered important enough to be studied and appreciated for their beauty, artistry, and craftsmanship. Option (D) is incorrect because many objects that are related to aesthetics, such as paintings, sculptures, and music, are viewed by people on a regular basis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) not essential to our existence.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Socrates believed that an unexamined life is a tragedy. This means that a life that is not thought about critically and deeply is a sad and unfortunate one. Socrates also believed that an unexamined life results in harm. Now, we need to figure out what exactly is harmed. Socrates believed that the harm was to something fundamental to our being, something that defines us. So, we can rule out (A) the state and (B) the justice system, as these are external factors that do not define us. This leaves (C) the body and (D) the soul. While the body is certainly important, Socrates believed that the soul was the core of our being and therefore the most important thing to examine. Therefore, the answer is (D) the soul.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Kant's philosophy centers around the concept of the \"good will\" as the sole intrinsic good. He argues that actions and consequences can only be considered good if they are done out of a sense of duty, rather than a desire for personal gain or other external factors.

Therefore, we can eliminate this option.\n\nOption (B) describes precisely the situation that Aristotle associates with incontinence, as the person is aware of the moral implications of their actions, but fails to exert self-control. This is the correct answer.\n\nOption (C) refers to a state of emotional self-awareness and self-restraint, which is not in line with the idea of incontinence that Aristotle proposes. Therefore, we can eliminate this option.\n\nOption (D) suggests that the right action is done, but for the wrong reasons, which is a different concept from incontinence.

            "model_answer": "Nagel claims that most skeptical arguments grow from the consistent application of ordinary standards. This is because Nagel argues that skepticism often arises when we apply ordinary standards of justification to beliefs that we have not critically examined before. When we do this consistently, we may find that our beliefs are not as well justified as we previously thought, which can lead to skepticism about those beliefs. Therefore, the answer is (D).",

He argues that we should consider the interests of all beings affected by our actions, and give equal weight to their interests. \n\nTo comply with this principle, we would need to make changes in our behavior and in society as a whole. If we only made modest changes to our personal habits, we would not be doing enough to prevent harm and suffering on a large scale. Similarly, if we only made drastic changes to our personal habits but not to society as a whole, we would still be contributing to harm and suffering through our participation in harmful structures and systems.\n\nTherefore, Singer's principle requires (D) drastic changes to both our personal habits and to our society.",

In other words, we should not use other people as tools to achieve our own goals, but rather respect their inherent dignity as rational beings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws.",
