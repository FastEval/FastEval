            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "There are many ways to approach this question, but one common method is to look at data from reliable sources. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the prevalence of obesity among US adults was 39.8% and affected about 93.3 million adults during 2015-2016. Since overweight is often defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher, and obesity is defined as having a BMI of 30 or higher, it is safe to say that the percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who were overweight was higher than 39.8%. Therefore, the answer is likely to be either (C) 40% or (D) 80%. However, since 80% seems too high and there is no indication that the question specifically refers to obesity, it makes more sense to choose (C) 40% as a reasonable estimate for the percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who were overweight as of 2016. \n\n(C)",

            "question": "What was GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 when adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices?\n\n(A) About $300\n(B) About $3k\n(C) About $8k\n(D) About $15k",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Find the nominal GDP per capita in the United States in 1850.\n\nTo find the nominal GDP per capita in the United States in 1850, we can look at historical data. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the nominal GDP in the United States in 1850 was approximately $2.7 billion and the population was around 23 million people. Therefore, the nominal GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 was about $117.\n\nStep 2: Adjust for inflation using a price index.\n\nTo adjust for inflation, we need to find a price index that spans from 1850 to 2011. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a commonly used price index that measures changes in the cost of living over time. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the CPI in 1850 was 10.4 and the CPI in 2011 was 224.91.\n\nTo adjust the nominal GDP per capita from 1850 to 2011 dollars, we can use the following formula:\n\nReal GDP per capita = (Nominal GDP per capita / CPI in 1850) x CPI in 2011\n\nReal GDP per capita = ($117 / 10.4) x 224.91\n\nReal GDP per capita = $1325.47\n\nStep 3: Adjust for purchasing power parity (PPP) using an exchange rate.\n\nTo adjust for PPP, we need to find an exchange rate that accounts for the differences in the cost of living between countries. The World Bank publishes data on PPP exchange rates. According to the World Bank, the PPP exchange rate between the United States and an international basket of goods and services was 1.17 in 2011.\n\nTo adjust the real GDP per capita in 2011 dollars to PPP dollars, we can use the following formula:\n\nPPP-adjusted GDP per capita = Real GDP per capita / PPP exchange rate\n\nPPP-adjusted GDP per capita = $1325.47 / 1.17\n\nPPP-adjusted GDP per capita = $1132.89\n\nAnswer: (A) About $300",
