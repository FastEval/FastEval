To answer this question, we need to find a reliable source of information. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a government agency in the United States responsible for public health.\n3. According to the CDC, the prevalence of obesity among adults in the United States was 39.8% in 2016.\n4. While not all adults who are overweight are necessarily considered obese, we can use this number as an estimate for the percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who were overweight in 2016.\n5. Therefore, the answer is (C) 40%.",

            "question": "What was GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 when adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices?\n\n(A) About $300\n(B) About $3k\n(C) About $8k\n(D) About $15k",

            "model_answer": "To calculate the answer, we need to use historical GDP data and convert it to 2011 prices using the GDP deflator. We also need to adjust for purchasing power parity (PPP) to account for differences in the cost of living between 1850 and 2011.\n\n1. Find historical GDP data for the United States in 1850. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the nominal GDP for the US in 1850 was $2.14 billion.\n\n2. Use the GDP deflator to convert nominal GDP to real GDP. The GDP deflator for 1850 is not readily available, so we'll use the next closest year for which data is available: 1852. The GDP deflator for 1852 was 13.7. Dividing nominal GDP by the GDP deflator gives us real GDP: $2.14 billion / 13.7 = $156.2 million.\n\n3. Adjust for PPP using the ratio of the price level in 1850 to the price level in 2011. The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides a CPI inflation calculator that can be used for this purpose. According to the calculator, the price level in 1850 was 8.7% of the price level in 2011. Dividing real GDP by this ratio gives us GDP in 2011 prices adjusted for PPP: $156.2 million / 0.087 = $1.79 billion.\n\n4. Divide GDP by the population in 1850 to get GDP per capita. According to the US Census Bureau, the population of the US in 1850 was 23.2 million. Dividing GDP by population gives us GDP per capita: $1.79 billion / 23.2 million = $76.98.\n\n5. Convert GDP per capita to units of thousands of dollars (i.e. $3k, $8k, etc.) by dividing by 1,000 and rounding to the nearest whole number. $76.98 / 1,000 \u2248 $0.077, which rounds to $0.08. Therefore, GDP per capita in 1850 adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices was about $80k. The answer is not among those provided, so it is (E) None of the above.",

            "model_answer": "There have been several surveys conducted in the United States about attitudes towards homosexuality. One of the most well-known and reputable is the General Social Survey (GSS), which has been conducted by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago since 1972. The GSS has included questions about attitudes towards homosexuality since 1988.\n\nThe most recent GSS data available at the time of writing is from 2018. According to this data, 61% of respondents in the United States said that homosexuality should be \"acceptable\" rather than \"not acceptable\" or \"morally wrong.\" It's worth noting that the GSS does not use the term \"should be accepted by society,\" but rather asks whether homosexuality is \"acceptable.\"\n\nWhile the closest answer choice to 61% is (B) 62%, we cannot be certain that this is the correct answer as it is not an exact match.
