            "model_answer": "The responsibility to protect (R2P) is a principle of international law that aims to prevent the mass atrocities of the population in a state without compromising its sovereignty. It is composed of three main elements: the responsibility to prevent, the responsibility to react, and the responsibility to rebuild.\n\nThe responsibility to prevent refers to the obligation of states to address the root causes of conflict and possible atrocity crimes before they occur.\n\nThe responsibility to react refers to the obligation of the international community to respond appropriately to atrocity crimes when a state has failed to do so.\n\nThe responsibility to rebuild refers to the obligation of the international community to assist states in rebuilding their institutions and societies after atrocity crimes have occurred.\n\nThus, the element of responsibility to protect that is not included is (C) the responsibility to remain sovereign.",

            "question": "Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\n\n(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "model_answer": "Option (A) could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security, as it emphasizes the interconnectedness of the global economy and the importance of maintaining a free-market trading system. This view holds that conflict over energy reserves is unlikely as long as this economic order is maintained. Option (B) suggests that energy scarcity could lead to a shift towards state control and neo-mercantilism, which would not align with liberal ideologies. Option (C) argues that the current order is unjust and favors capitalist economic elites, which could be seen as a critique of liberal capitalism. Option (D) predicts that energy scarcity could lead to geopolitical confrontation and resource wars, which again would not align with liberal viewpoints. Therefore, the answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what the human security concept is. The human security concept is an approach to international security that prioritizes the individual and their well-being over the security and interests of the state.\n\nOption (A) suggests that the human security concept is neo-colonial. This criticism is based on the idea that the concept is promoted by Western countries and is used as a way to interfere in the internal affairs of other states. However, this criticism is not necessarily true for all cases of human security implementation.\n\nOption (B) suggests that human security promotes global capitalism. This criticism is based on the idea that the concept focuses on economic development as a means of achieving security, which could lead to the exploitation of resources and labor in developing countries. However, promoting economic development does not necessarily mean promoting global capitalism.\n\nOption (C) suggests that human security is too broad. This criticism is based on the idea that the concept encompasses a wide range of issues, from economic development to environmental protection, which could make it difficult to prioritize and implement specific policies. However, the broad scope of human security is also one of its strengths, as it acknowledges the interconnectedness of various issues and their impact on individuals' well-being.\n\nOption (D) suggests that all of the options are common criticisms of the human security concept. While each of the options could be a criticism, it is not necessarily true that all of them are common criticisms. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Human security is too broad.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated.\n(D) Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated.

            "question": "In what ways do theories of conventional and critical social constructivism differ?\n\n(A) Conventional constructivists view constructivism as a bridge between rationalist and reflectivist approaches, enabling both to benefit from the insights of the other. Conversely, critical constructivists argue that this approach simply reproduces the binary distinctions that characterize positivist methodology.\n(B) Critical constructivism regards the strength of social constructivism to be its ability to bridge rationalist and reflectivity approaches. Conversely, social constructivists regard this as an unhelpful regression to positivist binary frameworks of analysis.\n(C) Conventional constructivism refers to the earlier works of social constructivist theorists that are characterised by a rejection of positivist methodology.
