One way to approach this is to try to form some basic Boolean gates, such as AND, OR, and NOT gates, using only the given set of operators.\n\nOption (A) has both the AND and NOT operators, which are two of the basic gates. We can form an OR gate using De Morgan's laws: A OR B = NOT(NOT A AND NOT B). Thus, option (A) is complete.\n\nOption (B) has the NOT and OR operators. Using De Morgan's laws again, we can form an AND gate: A AND B = NOT(NOT A OR NOT B).
