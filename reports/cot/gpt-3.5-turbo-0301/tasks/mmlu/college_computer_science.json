The minimum number of connected components in any graph with 10 nodes and 6 edges would be 4, which can be achieved by taking a complete graph on 4 nodes and removing a total of 8 edges. The maximum number of connected components in any graph with 10 nodes is 10, which would be achieved in the case where there are 10 isolated nodes.\n\nNow, let's consider the constraint that there are no self-loops or multiple edges between any pair of nodes. With no self-loops, each node can be connected to at most 9 other nodes, which means that there can be at most 90 edges in the graph. Since we are given that there are 6 edges, this means that there must be at least one connected component with more than one node, as otherwise there would not be enough edges to connect all of the nodes.\n\nTherefore, we know that m = 1. To find the maximum number of connected components, we can consider the case where we add edges to the graph in a way that maximizes the number of components. One such way would be to start with the 10 isolated nodes and add edges one at a time in a way that does not create new components until it is required. We can do this by always choosing an edge between two nodes that are already in the same component. This way, we will only create a new component when all of the nodes are already connected to each other. Using this strategy, we can create a graph with 10 nodes and 6 edges that has only one connected component, so M = 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) M = 1, m = 1.",
