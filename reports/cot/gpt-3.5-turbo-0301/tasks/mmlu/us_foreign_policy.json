            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The United Nations Security Council is composed of 15 members, which includes 5 permanent members and 10 rotating members. The 5 permanent members are the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Russia, and France, and they hold veto power, which means they can block any substantive resolution from passing, regardless of the level of international support for the resolution. The 10 rotating members are elected for 2-year terms and do not hold veto power. Therefore, the structure of the United Nations Security Council is (A) 5 permanent members with veto power, 10 rotating members with no veto power.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the term \"nonstate actor.\" Nonstate actors are groups or individuals that operate outside the control of government and can potentially pose a threat to nation-states.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each option given and determine if it fits the definition of a nonstate actor.\n\n- (A) Terrorists: Terrorist groups, by their very nature, are nonstate actors that aim to achieve political goals through violent means. They are not controlled by any government and can pose a significant threat to nation-states.\n- (B) Organized crime: Organized crime groups, such as mafia or gangs, are also nonstate actors that operate outside the control of government. They engage in illegal activities such as drug trafficking, money laundering, and human trafficking, which can destabilize societies and pose a threat to nation-states.\n- (C) Drug traffickers: Like organized crime, drug traffickers are a nonstate actor that engages in illegal activity and operates outside government control. They can pose a significant threat to national security by destabilizing societies, increasing violence, and funding other illicit activities.\n- (D) China: While China is a powerful country, it is still a state actor that is recognized internationally. It has a government, a military, and a defined territory, and therefore does not fit the definition of a nonstate actor.\n\nStep 3: Determine which option is not a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States.\n\n(D) China is not a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The United States established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979. However, before that, there had been other contacts between the two countries. In the early 1970s, Henry Kissinger, the National Security Advisor and later Secretary of State under Presidents Nixon and Ford, had made secret trips to China to pave the way for a normalization of relations. This culminated in President Nixon's historic visit to China in February 1972, where he met with Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders. While this visit was a major step in the thawing of U.S.-China relations, it was not a formal recognition of the Chinese government, and it did not lead to immediate diplomatic relations. It wasn't until 1979, during the Carter administration, that the United States recognized the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China and established diplomatic relations. However, Carter did not visit China himself. That leaves us with two possible answers: (A) Richard Nixon, who visited China in 1972, or (D) Ronald Reagan, who was in office during the early 1980s, after the establishment of diplomatic relations. However, Reagan did not visit China either. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Richard Nixon.",

However, this movement is not specifically related to foreign policy, so we need to look for more information. \n\nStep 2: Look for information on how the 'New Populism' may have affected foreign policy. \n\nAfter further research, we find that the term 'New Populism' was also used in the early 21st century to describe a shift in American foreign policy towards increased incorporation of public opinion. This shift was driven by a desire to address the perceived disconnect between the American people and their government, and to promote greater accountability and transparency in foreign policy decision-making. \n\nStep 3: Determine the answer based on our research. \n\nFrom our research, we can determine that the 'New Populism' refers to increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making.

At the same time, the United States maintained a position of neutrality for the majority of the war and therefore was not directly affected by these economic pressures. As a result, the United States was able to become a creditor country, lending money to European nations to help finance their war efforts.
