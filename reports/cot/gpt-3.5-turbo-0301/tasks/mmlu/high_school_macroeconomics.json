From this it can be inferred that\n\n(A) inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus.\n(B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n(C) aggregate supply decreased.\n(D) aggregate demand is steeply sloped.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "If an expansionary fiscal policy leads to a large increase in real output and a small increase in the price level, it implies that the aggregate demand has increased, causing an increase in both the price level and real output. The fact that the increase in real output is larger than the increase in the price level suggests that the aggregate supply curve is relatively elastic, meaning that the economy initially had some unemployed resources. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods, while quotas are limits on the amount of a product that can be imported. \n\nWhen a tariff is imposed, it increases the cost of the imported product, making it more expensive than domestically produced goods. This leads to a decrease in demand for the imported product, which can result in a lower amount of the product sold domestically. However, because the price of the imported product has gone up, domestic producers of similar products may be able to charge higher prices, leading to (A) lower domestic prices.\n\nQuotas, on the other hand, limit the amount of a product that can be imported. This often leads to an increase in the price of the imported product, making it more expensive than domestic alternatives. This can increase demand for domestically produced goods, leading to (D) an increase in the amount of the product sold domestically. However, the increased demand may also lead to shortages and higher prices for the domestic product, making it less affordable for consumers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) sometimes raise and sometimes lower the amount of the product sold domestically.",

            "question": "A likely cause of falling Treasury bond prices might be\n\n(A) expansionary monetary policy.\n(B) contractionary monetary policy.\n(C) a depreciating dollar.\n(D) fiscal policy designed to reduce the budget deficit.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Falling Treasury bond prices suggest that demand for the bonds is decreasing relative to their supply. This could happen for a variety of reasons, including changes in monetary or fiscal policy that affect the overall economy. \n\nOption (A), expansionary monetary policy, involves increasing the money supply in order to stimulate spending and investment. This could potentially lead to an increase in demand for Treasury bonds, as investors seek safe and stable investments. Therefore, option (A) is not a likely cause of falling Treasury bond prices.\n\nOption (B), contractionary monetary policy, involves reducing the money supply in order to combat inflation. This could potentially lead to a decrease in demand for Treasury bonds, as investors seek higher returns elsewhere. Therefore, option (B) is a possible cause of falling Treasury bond prices.\n\nOption (C), a depreciating dollar, means that the value of the US currency is decreasing relative to other currencies. This could potentially lead to a decrease in demand for Treasury bonds from foreign investors, as they see weaker returns due to the value of their investments being reduced in their own currency. Therefore, option (C) is a possible cause of falling Treasury bond prices.\n\nOption (D), fiscal policy designed to reduce the budget deficit, involves the government cutting its spending and/or increasing taxes in order to reduce the deficit. This could lead to a decrease in demand for Treasury bonds if investors believe that the reduced spending or higher taxes will slow down economic growth and make the bonds less attractive. Therefore, option (D) is a possible cause of falling Treasury bond prices.\n\nBased on the above, the likely answer is (B) contractionary monetary policy.",
