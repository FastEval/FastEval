            "question": "Suppose that an expansionary fiscal policy leads to a large increase in real output and a small increase in the price level. From this it can be inferred that\n\n(A) inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus.\n(B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n(C) aggregate supply decreased.\n(D) aggregate demand is steeply sloped.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "If real output increased while the price level only increased slightly, this suggests that there was spare capacity in the economy before the fiscal policy was implemented. Specifically, the increase in output means that previously unemployed resources (e.g. labor, capital) have been put to work. At the same time, the small increase in the price level suggests that the aggregate supply curve is relatively elastic, meaning that producers were able to increase output without pushing prices up by much. Therefore, the answer is (B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.",

This restriction reduces competition for domestic producers, which can lead to an increase in the price of the domestic product. Additionally, the restriction can result in decreased availability of the imported product, which may lead to increased demand for the domestic product. \n\nTherefore, tariffs and quotas often result in lower amounts of the imported product sold domestically, which can lead to increased sales of the domestic product. \n\nHowever, it is also possible that the restriction on imports may lead to decreased availability and higher prices for both the imported and domestic products, which could lead to a decrease in sales overall. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) sometimes raise and sometimes lower the amount of the product sold domestically.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Falling Treasury bond prices indicate an increase in the yield of these bonds. This means that investors are demanding higher returns for lending money to the government, indicating a perception of increased risk. \n\nOption (A) expansionary monetary policy involves the central bank increasing the money supply by lowering interest rates. This would typically lead to lower bond yields, so it is not a likely cause of falling bond prices. \n\nOption (B) contractionary monetary policy involves the central bank decreasing the money supply by raising interest rates. This would likely lead to higher bond yields and may be a possible cause of falling bond prices. \n\nOption (C) a depreciating dollar refers to a situation where the US dollar loses value relative to other currencies. This may encourage foreign investors to sell US Treasury bonds, leading to a decline in prices. However, it is not the most likely cause of falling bond prices. \n\nOption (D) fiscal policy designed to reduce the budget deficit involves the government cutting spending or increasing taxes. This can reduce economic growth and may cause investors to demand higher returns for holding bonds, leading to falling bond prices. \n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of falling Treasury bond prices is (D) fiscal policy designed to reduce the budget deficit.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "When households perceive that the value of their assets is decreasing or there is a shortage of money, they may demand more money as an asset. \n\nOption (A) states that nominal GDP falls. This does not necessarily indicate a decrease in the value of assets or a shortage of money, so it is unlikely that households would demand more money as an asset in this scenario.\n\nOption (B) states that the nominal interest rate falls. When the interest rate is low, it may be less appealing for households to invest their money in other assets, such as bonds or stocks. Therefore, they may opt to hold onto more cash, resulting in a higher demand for money as an asset.\n\nOption (C) states that bond prices fall. When bond prices fall, it means that interest rates are increasing and the yield on bonds is higher. In this case, households may be more likely to invest in bonds and less likely to hold onto cash, resulting in a lower demand for money as an asset.\n\nOption (D) states that the supply of money falls. When the supply of money is low, it may become more difficult for households to obtain the cash they need for day-to-day expenses or investments. In this scenario, households may demand more money as an asset to ensure that they have enough cash on hand.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).",

It calculates the value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific time period. Hence, option (A) is correct - GDP measures production within a nation's borders.\n\nGDP includes not only the production by a nation's citizens but also production by foreigners within the country. However, production by a nation's citizens outside the country is not included. Hence, option (B) is incorrect.\n\nGDP can be calculated by either using the expenditure approach, income approach, or production approach.

Therefore, (C) is false. The natural rate of unemployment does not necessarily imply zero inflation, as there can be inflation due to factors such as increases in the cost of inputs or changes in demand.
