Thus we can write the given field extension as $Q(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{2}\\cdot 3)$. \n\nNext, we note that $Q(\\sqrt{2})$ and $Q(\\sqrt{3})$ are both quadratic extensions over $Q$, since the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{2}$ over $Q$ is $x^2-2$, and the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{3}$ over $Q$ is $x^2-3$. Thus $[Q(\\sqrt{2}):Q]=[Q(\\sqrt{3}):Q]= 2$. \n\nNow, we consider the element $\\alpha=\\sqrt{2}\\cdot 3$ in the field extension. The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $Q$ is $(x/3)^2-2$, or $x^2-18$. Thus $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}]=2$, since it is a quadratic extension over $Q$. \n\nSince each of the three extensions in $Q(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{2}\\cdot 3)$ is quadratic over $Q$, the total degree of the extension is the product of the degrees of each extension. Thus, $[Q(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{2}\\cdot 3) : Q] = [Q(\\sqrt{2}):Q]\\cdot [Q(\\sqrt{3}):Q]\\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2 = 8$. \n\nHowever, we count $Q$ as part of the field extension, so we subtract 1 from the total degree to get the answer. \n\nTherefore, the degree of the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is  $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 6}$.",

Another way is to use the fact that if a is a zero of the polynomial, then x-a is a factor of the polynomial. Therefore, we can try to factor the polynomial over Z_5 and see if we can find any linear factors.\n\nFirst, we note that the polynomial has degree 5, so it has at most 5 zeros in Z_5.

The forward direction is easy to prove: if a ring homomorphism is one to one, then the kernel must be {0}, because if there were any other element in the kernel, the homomorphism would not be one to one. \n\nFor the backward direction, we need to show that if the kernel is {0}, then the homomorphism is one to one. To do this, suppose that there exist elements a and b in the domain of the homomorphism such that f(a) = f(b). We need to show that a = b. \n\nSince f(a) = f(b), we can rewrite this as f(a) - f(b) = f(a-b) = 0, which means that a - b is in the kernel of f.
