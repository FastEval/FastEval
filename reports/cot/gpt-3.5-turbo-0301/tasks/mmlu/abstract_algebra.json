            "model_answer": "We can begin by noting that each of the square roots is algebraic over the base field Q, and in fact, we can simplify the given field extension since sqrt(18) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(3). Thus, we can re-write the extension as Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). \n\nTo find the degree of this extension, we can note that each square root gives a quadratic extension, since the roots of x^2 - 2 = 0 and x^2 - 3 = 0 are both included. However, it's possible that the two square roots aren't independent - they could be related by some polynomial. \n\nTo check if this is the case, we can consider the product of the two minimal polynomials, which is (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = x^4 - 5x^2 + 6. If this polynomial is irreducible over Q, then the degree of the extension is 4. Otherwise, the degree will be 2. \n\nWe can factor the polynomial as (x - sqrt(2) - sqrt(3))(x + sqrt(2) - sqrt(3))(x - sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))(x + sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)), which shows that the polynomial is indeed irreducible over Q. Therefore, the degree of the extension is 4. \n\nSo the answer is (B) 4.",

This is true because given a homomorphism from G to some other group H, we can define a normal subgroup N of G by taking the kernel of the homomorphism (i.e., the set of all elements in G that are mapped to the identity element in H). Then, the homomorphic image of G is isomorphic to the factor group G/N, which is a subgroup of G consisting of all the cosets of N. \n\nOn the other hand, Statement 2 says that the homomorphic images of G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G.

The factor groups of G are Z/nZ (the integers modulo n under addition), where n is any positive integer.
