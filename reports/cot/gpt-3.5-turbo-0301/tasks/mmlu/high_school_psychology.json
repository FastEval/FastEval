            "model_answer": "Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is a condition where a person can see objects up close clearly but has difficulty seeing objects far away. This means that the light rays are not properly focused on the retina at the back of the eye. \n\nOne possible cause of nearsightedness is the shape of the cornea and lens. If they are too curved, light is focused too much in front of the retina, causing distant objects to appear blurry. \n\nOption (A) states that nearsightedness results from too much curvature of the cornea and lens. This is a correct explanation, as it matches the definition of myopia. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

A statistic that provides information about this variation or spread would be most useful in this case.\n\nThe mean and median are measures of central tendency and do not provide information about the spread directly. Therefore, options (B) and (D) can be eliminated.\n\nThe range is the difference between the highest and lowest scores in a distribution and provides some information about the spread, but it is sensitive to extreme scores that may not be representative of the overall dataset. Thus, option (C) may not be the best choice.\n\nVariance, on the other hand, measures the average distance of each score from the mean of the data. Standard deviation is the square root of variance. Since variance takes into account all the scores in a distribution, it provides a more accurate and comprehensive measure of the spread. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

However, the NASP position statement does not limit the supervision to only those who are not fully certified or licensed. Instead, it states that school psychologists who provide supervision must have the appropriate credentials and expertise to provide effective and responsible supervision to all school psychology professionals, including both interns and fully certified or licensed school psychologists. Therefore, option (A) is inaccurate.\n\n(B) The option states that school psychologists should provide professional but not administrative supervision. The NASP position statement does not make a distinction between professional and administrative supervision. Instead, it emphasizes that supervisors should provide a variety of types of supervision, including both individual and group supervision, and that these types of supervision should be designed to meet the needs of the supervisee. Therefore, option (B) is not entirely accurate.\n\n(C) The option states that school psychologists are eligible to serve as supervisors after one year of experience as a school psychologist. The NASP position statement does not specify a specific timeline for when a school psychologist is eligible to serve as a supervisor. Instead, it states that school psychologists who provide supervision should have appropriate credentials and expertise, as well as a thorough understanding of the specific supervision needs of the supervisee. Therefore, option (C) is inaccurate.\n\n(D) The option states that school psychologists should hold the Nationally Certified School Psychologist credential or the state school psychologist credential. The NASP position statement specifies that school psychologists who provide supervision must have the appropriate credentials and expertise to provide effective and responsible supervision. This may include the Nationally Certified School Psychologist credential or the state school psychologist credential, but it is not limited to these credentials. Therefore, option (D) is not entirely accurate.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the most accurate answer concerning school psychologists who will be supervising in a school district is (B) They should provide professional but not administrative supervision.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Erikson's psychosocial stage theory.\n\nExplanation:\n- Piaget's cognitive development theory focused on how children construct knowledge and understanding of the world. It did not specifically address personality development over the lifespan.\n- Kohlberg's moral development theory focused on how individuals reason about moral dilemmas. While it may have some implications for personality development, it does not directly address personality characteristics.\n- Ainsworth's social attachment theory focused on how infants develop attachments to their primary caregivers. While attachment may have some influence on personality, this theory did not address personality development over the lifespan.\n- Erikson's psychosocial stage theory proposes that individuals encounter a unique developmental challenge during each of eight stages of life, from infancy to old age. These challenges, if resolved successfully, contribute to healthy personality development. Therefore, Erikson's theory is the developmental stage theory that explains how experiences in infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age influence later personality characteristics.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Erikson's psychosocial stage theory.",
