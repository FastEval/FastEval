            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is a condition in which a person can see nearby objects clearly but objects at a distance appear blurry. This occurs because the light entering the eye is focused in front of the retina instead of directly on it. \n\nThe curvature of the cornea and lens are the primary refractive surfaces of the eye that focus incoming light. If the curvature is too steep, the light will be focused too strongly and cause images to appear blurry. Conversely, if the curvature is too flat, the light will not be focused enough and again cause blurry vision. \n\nThe iris is responsible for controlling the size of the pupil and regulating the amount of light entering the eye. It does not play a direct role in refracting light and focusing it on the retina. \n\nTherefore, option (B) too little curvature of the cornea and lens would result in nearsightedness. \n\nAnswer: B",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Delusions of grandeur are beliefs that one is much more powerful or important than they really are. These delusions are not based in reality and can often lead to feelings of being superior to others. \n\nOne disorder that is often associated with delusions of grandeur is schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and abnormal behaviors. Delusions of grandeur can be a symptom of schizophrenia, but it is important to note that not all people with schizophrenia experience these types of delusions.\n\nOCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) typically involves obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors that are performed in an effort to alleviate anxiety or distress. While delusions of grandeur may occur in people with OCD, these types of delusions are not typically associated with this disorder.\n\nConversion disorder is a condition in which an individual experiences symptoms that mimic a neurological disorder but have no known biological cause. Symptoms can include weakness, paralysis, blindness, or seizures. Delusions of grandeur are not typically associated with conversion disorder.\n\nAntisocial personality disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a disregard for the feelings of others and a lack of remorse for actions that may harm others. While individuals with this disorder may have an exaggerated sense of self-importance, it is not typically characterized by delusions of grandeur.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) schizophrenia.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Hierarchy of needs.\n\n- Abraham Maslow proposed the idea that some motives are more imperative to survival than others.\n- Maslow developed the concept of the hierarchy of needs, which suggests that certain needs must be satisfied before others.\n- The hierarchy is typically represented as a pyramid, with basic physiological needs at the bottom and self-actualization needs at the top.\n- The lower needs (physiological and safety) are considered more imperative to survival than the higher needs (love/belonging, esteem, and self-actualization).\n- Therefore, the approach that expresses Maslow's idea that some motives are more imperative to survival than others is the Hierarchy of needs approach. \n\nThus, the answer is (D) Hierarchy of needs.",

Riles was a case that challenged the use of IQ tests to disproportionately place Black students in special education classes.

This is because the first few items have had the most rehearsal time and are therefore stored in the long-term memory, while the last few items are still fresh in the short-term memory. Since Dan read the list of 30 vocabulary words only once, we can assume that he did not rehearse them extensively, and therefore the items he remembers two days later are likely to follow the serial position effect.
