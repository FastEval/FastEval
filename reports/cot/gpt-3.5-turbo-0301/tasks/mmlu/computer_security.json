            "model_answer": "To determine which style of fuzzer is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the given program, we need to consider the characteristics of each style.\n\nA generational fuzzer typically generates new test cases based on the results of previous ones. This means it may not explore paths that have not been encountered before.\n\nA blackbox fuzzer uses only inputs and outputs to generate test cases. It does not have any knowledge of the internal workings of the program.\n\nA whitebox fuzzer has knowledge of the internal workings of the program and uses this information to generate test cases.\n\nA mutation-based fuzzer creates variations of a seed input and tests each variation. It may not explore paths that are significantly different from the seed input.\n\nBased on these characteristics, the style of fuzzer that is most likely to explore paths covering every line of code is (C) Whitebox, as it has knowledge of the internal workings of the program and can use this information to generate test cases that exercise different parts of the code. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

Option (A) does not specify how the server distinguishes between expired and valid tickets, and therefore cannot be considered correct. Option (B) describes a timer that is set when a client connects to a server, but this has nothing to do with the ticket's maximum lifetime. Option (D) is close, but it does not explain how the KDC determines whether the ticket is still valid or not. \n\nOption (C) is the correct answer because it explains that the server compares the ticket's expiration time to its current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket has expired.
