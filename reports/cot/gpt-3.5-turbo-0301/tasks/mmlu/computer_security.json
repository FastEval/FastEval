Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don\u2019t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.\n2.

Therefore, the answer is (A) True, True. \n\n- TLS provides integrity and confidentiality protection for data in transit, which means that any replayed bytes will fail the integrity check and therefore be detected as invalid.\n- TLS includes server authentication through a certificate that is validated by the client, and uses cryptographic keys to ensure that the server is who it claims to be, preventing server impersonation.",

While it may allow remote access to the infected computer, it is primarily focused on stealing sensitive data and does not fit the definition of a remote Trojan. \n\n(D) Game-Troj - This is a type of Trojan that is typically disguised as a legitimate game or software download.
