As a result, more of the taller individuals are able to obtain nutrients and survive to pass along their genetic information. This is an example of\n\n(A) directional selection.\n(B) stabilizing selection.\n(C) sexual selection.\n(D) disruptive selection.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The environmental change is favoring the tallest individuals in the population. This means that there is selection pressure towards taller individuals. As a result, more of the taller individuals are able to survive, reproduce, and pass along their genetic information to the next generation. This is an example of directional selection, because the selection pressure is leading to a shift in the population towards taller individuals. Therefore, the answer is (A) directional selection.",

            "model_answer": "The start codon in mRNA is AUG, which codes for methionine. \n\n(A) A deletion of a single nucleotide after the start codon would cause a frameshift mutation, changing the reading frame of the mRNA and likely resulting in a premature stop codon. This would have a deleterious effect, but it may still allow for the production of a truncated protein.\n\n(B) A deletion of a nucleotide triplet after the start codon would also cause a frameshift mutation, but it would have an even greater deleterious effect as more amino acids would be affected and the resulting protein would likely be nonfunctional.\n\n(C) A single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the first codon position would change the amino acid coded for by the start codon from methionine to a different amino acid. This would have a deleterious effect, but it may still allow for the production of a modified protein.\n\n(D) A single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the third codon position would result in a different nucleotide coding for the same amino acid as before. This is due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, where different codons can code for the same amino acid. Therefore, this would likely have the least deleterious effect.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

In other words, despite not being closely related, they develop similar characteristics due to similar selective pressures. \n\n(A) The pectoral fins of fish and the front legs of cats are not good examples of convergent evolution as they are both derived from limbs. Fish and cats are not closely related and neither share a recent common ancestor with limbs. \n\n(B) The presence of a notochord in all chordate embryos is a shared derived trait, meaning it evolved early in the evolutionary history of the group and was inherited by all descendants. This is not an example of convergent evolution. \n\n(C) The wings of an insect and the wings of a bird are a classic example of convergent evolution. Both insects and birds have developed wings independently as a way to fly, despite not being closely related. \n\n(D) The leaves of an oak tree and the spines of a cactus are not a good example of convergent evolution as they serve different functions. Oak leaves are for photosynthesis while cactus spines are for defense. \n\nTherefore, the best example of convergent evolution is (C) the wings of an insect and the wings of a bird. \n\nAnswer: C",

Therefore, we are looking for a tissue or structure that is actively growing or repairing. \n\nOption A, cross section of muscle tissue, is unlikely to show mitotic cell divisions as muscle cells are post-mitotic (no longer able to divide). \n\nOption B, cross section of an anther, may show mitotic cell divisions as it is a site of pollen production, which requires cell division. However, this is not the most likely option. \n\nOption C, longitudinal section of a shoot tip, is the best option as it contains actively dividing cells responsible for plant growth.
