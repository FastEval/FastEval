            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the type of selection occurring in the giraffe population.\n- The environmental change is favoring individuals who are tallest.\n- This means that individuals who are taller are able to obtain more nutrients and survive better.\n- Therefore, more of the taller individuals will be able to pass along their genetic information.\n- This is an example of selection.\n\nStep 2: Determine the type of selection.\n- Directional selection occurs when individuals at one end of a phenotypic spectrum have higher fitness than those in the middle or at the other end.\n- Stabilizing selection occurs when individuals in the middle of a phenotypic spectrum have higher fitness than those at either end.\n- Sexual selection occurs when certain traits increase an individual's mating success, but may not necessarily increase survival.\n- Disruptive selection occurs when individuals at both ends of a phenotypic spectrum have higher fitness than those in the middle.\n\nStep 3: Apply the definitions of the types of selection to the information about the giraffes.\n- The environmental change is favoring individuals who are tallest, meaning the individuals at one end of the phenotypic spectrum.\n- Their ability to obtain more nutrients and survive better gives them higher fitness than those who are not as tall.\n- Therefore, we can conclude that the giraffe population is undergoing directional selection.\n\nStep 4: Output the answer.\n(A) directional selection.",

            "question": "Which of the changes below following the start codon in an mRNA would most likely have the greatest deleterious effect?\n\n(A) a deletion of a single nucleotide\n(B) a deletion of a nucleotide triplet\n(C) a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the first codon position\n(D) a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the third codon position",

            "model_answer": "The start codon in an mRNA is AUG. Any changes following this codon would affect the coding sequence of the protein. \n\n(A) A deletion of a single nucleotide would shift the reading frame by one and cause a frameshift mutation. This would lead to the formation of an entirely different amino acid sequence downstream from the point of the deletion, resulting in a non-functional or truncated protein. This change would have a deleterious effect.\n\n(B) A deletion of a nucleotide triplet would cause the loss of an entire codon. This would also lead to a frameshift mutation and the formation of an entirely different amino acid sequence downstream from the point of the deletion, resulting in a non-functional or truncated protein. This change would have a more deleterious effect than option (A).\n\n(C) A single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the first codon position would change the amino acid encoded by the first codon. However, the amino acid may still be functional and the overall protein structure may not be affected. This change would have a lesser deleterious effect than options (A) and (B).\n\n(D) A single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the third codon position would still encode for the same amino acid as the original codon due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. This change would have the least deleterious effect of all the options.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

These cells are present in invertebrates and play a crucial role in their immune defenses. \n\nCytotoxic T-lymphocytes, B-cells, and Helper T-cells are all components of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates, which invertebrates do not have.

This can help to prevent more intense and destructive fires from starting, which can be beneficial for both the ecosystem and adjacent human communities. Option (B) is incorrect as wildfires do not leach nutrients from the soil but instead enrich it.
