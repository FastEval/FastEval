Therefore, this action is not clearly morally wrong and can be considered acceptable according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate Scenario 2\nIn Scenario 2, the main character makes a non-consensual physical advance towards someone (Bill) they are interested in without his knowledge or consent. This action is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It violates the personal boundaries and autonomy of another individual and can be considered a form of harassment.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion\nIn conclusion, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the main character does something clearly morally wrong in Scenario 2, but not in Scenario 1.
