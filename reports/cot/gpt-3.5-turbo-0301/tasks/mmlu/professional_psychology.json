However, this statement only addresses sexual functioning in females and does not provide information about sexual functioning in males.\n\nStep 3: Statement (B) suggests that aging is associated with an increase in the frequency and number of orgasmic contractions in both sexes. This statement addresses sexual functioning in both males and females and provides specific details about changes that occur with aging.\n\nStep 4: Statement (C) suggests that there is no significant relationship between aging and sexual responses in either sex. This statement is not supported by scientific research, which has identified a number of changes that occur in sexual functioning as a result of aging.\n\nStep 5: Statement (D) suggests that aging is related to some loss of erectile rigidity in the male. This statement addresses changes that occur specifically in male sexual functioning and provides specific details about those changes.\n\nStep 6: Based on the analysis of each statement, the statement that expresses a relationship between aging and sexual functioning is (B).",

He also did not believe that children are less intelligent than adults (B) but rather that they think qualitatively differently than adults. Piaget referred to children as \"little scientists\" (C), as they are constantly testing and exploring their environment in order to make sense of it. Finally, Piaget believed that the development of children is not solely shaped by culture (D), but rather is a combination of both nature and nurture. Therefore, the answer to the question is (C) \"Little scientists\".",

It's possible for non-controlled substances to be teratogens as well. \n- Option B, \"A teratogen,\" is the correct answer as it refers to any substance that can cause abnormal fetal development, including birth defects, growth problems, and developmental disorders. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) A teratogen.",

A summative evaluation occurs after the training program has been implemented to evaluate its effectiveness, while a formative evaluation is ongoing throughout the development and implementation process.

Past experiences are not necessarily ignored, but the therapist does not encourage clients to solely focus on them. Therefore, option A does not seem like an accurate description. \n\nOption B suggests that talking about the past is a way for the client to avoid the present, which goes against the principles of Gestalt therapy. \n\nOption C refers to the concept of the \u201csecond layer\u201d of therapy, which is the exploration of the client\u2019s beliefs, values, and feelings that underlie their presenting issue. While past experiences may be relevant to this exploration, it is not the sole focus. \n\nOption D suggests that talking about the past is a way to achieve closure near the end of therapy. While closure is an important component of Gestalt therapy, it does not necessarily involve exclusively talking about the past. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is (A) a useful strategy for helping the client understand the present.",
