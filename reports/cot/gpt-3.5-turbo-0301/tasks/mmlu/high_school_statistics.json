An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim.

            "model_answer": "We will use a one-sample t-test to test the manufacturer's claim that the mean weight of aspirin tablets is 300 milligrams. The null hypothesis is that the population mean weight is 300, and the alternative hypothesis is that it is different from 300.\n\nTo calculate the test statistic, we first need to calculate the sample mean and sample standard deviation. The sample mean is (299+300+305+302+299+301+303)/7 = 301.43. The sample standard deviation is sqrt(((299-301.43)^2 + (300-301.43)^2 + (305-301.43)^2 + (302-301.43)^2 + (299-301.43)^2 + (301-301.43)^2 + (303-301.43)^2)/(7-1)) = 2.18.\n\nThe test statistic is then given by t = (301.43 - 300)/(2.18/sqrt(7)) = 1.54. The degrees of freedom for the test are df = 6 (n-1). \n\nTo find the P-value of the test, we need to determine the probability that a t-distribution with 6 degrees of freedom is greater than 1.54 in absolute value. Using a t-table or calculator, we find that this probability is about 0.17, which is the P-value of the test. \n\nThe answer is (A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "We need to use the normal distribution to find the time interval associated with 100,000 riders, which is the shortest. We know that the mean waiting time is 35 minutes and the standard deviation is 10 minutes for each rider. We want to find the time interval that contains 100,000 riders, which is roughly two-thirds of the total number of riders.\n\nTo find the z-score for the 100,000th rider, we can use the formula:\n\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere x is the number of minutes, \u03bc is the mean waiting time, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. We want to solve for x when z = -0.52 (corresponding to the 100,000th rider).\n\n-0.52 = (x - 35) / 10\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 29.4 minutes\n\nSo the time interval associated with 100,000 riders is from the minimum time (0 minutes) to 29.4 minutes. \n\nThe only answer choice that contains this interval is (A) 0 to 31.7 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "(A) If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level. \n\nThis statement is false. The 10% and 5% levels refer to the significance levels at which we reject the null hypothesis. A test with a higher significance level (e.g. 10%) requires less evidence to reject the null hypothesis than a test with a lower significance level (e.g. 5%). Therefore, if we reject the null hypothesis at the 10% level, it does not necessarily mean we have enough evidence to reject it at the 5% level. \n\n(B) Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered. \n\nThis statement is true. The decision to use a one-sided or two-sided test depends on the nature of the alternative hypothesis and is typically made before the data are gathered. \n\n(C) If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis. \n\nThis statement is false. The 1% level refers to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, also known as the Type I error rate. It does not refer to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis in general. \n\n(D) The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis. \n\nThis statement is true.

Therefore, option A is incorrect because we cannot make statements about the percentage of students within the interval. Option B is also incorrect because probability statements cannot be made about population parameters, only about data points.
