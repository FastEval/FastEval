An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim. Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(B) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n(D) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7",

            "model_answer": "We will use a one-sample t-test to test the manufacturer's claim about the weight of the aspirin tablets. The null hypothesis is that the true mean weight of the tablets is 300 mg, and the alternative hypothesis is that it is different from 300 mg. We will use a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05.\n\nWe first find the sample mean and standard deviation:\n\nx-bar = (299 + 300 + 305 + 302 + 299 + 301 + 303) / 7 = 301\ns = sqrt([(299-301)^2 + (300-301)^2 + ... + (303-301)^2] / 6) = 2.08\n\nThe t-statistic is then:\n\nt = (301 - 300) / (2.08 / sqrt(7)) = 1.54\n\nThe degrees of freedom for this test are df = n - 1 = 6. Using a t-table or calculator, we find that the two-tailed P-value for t = 1.54 with df = 6 is approximately 0.166. We double this value for the two-tailed test to get:\n\nP-value = 2 * 0.166 = 0.332\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

            "model_answer": "We know that the waiting times are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. We are looking for the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders out of a total of 150,000 riders the first summer.\n\nTo find the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders, we need to find the corresponding z-score for 100,000 riders. We can calculate the z-score using the formula:\n\nz = (x - mu) / sigma\n\nwhere x is the number of riders we are interested in, mu is the mean waiting time, and sigma is the standard deviation of waiting times.\n\nPlugging in the values for x, mu, and sigma, we get:\n\nz = (100000 - 35000) / 10000 = 6.5\n\nNow we need to find the two values of x that correspond to a z-score of 6.5. We can look up these values in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator. Either way, we will find that a z-score of 6.5 corresponds to a probability of approximately 0.999999, or 99.9999%.\n\nThis means that 100,000 riders corresponds to the 99.9999th percentile of the waiting time distribution. In other words, only 0.0001% of riders wait longer than this amount of time.\n\nTo find the corresponding waiting times, we can invert the z-score formula:\n\nx = z * sigma + mu\n\nPlugging in the values for z, sigma, and mu, we get:\n\nx = 6.5 * 10 + 35 = 100\n\nSo the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is from 100 minutes to positive infinity.\n\nThe answer is (E).",
