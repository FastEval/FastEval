            "question": "If the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition in a human population is .10 (one in ten), what will be the expected frequency of affected females?\n\n(A) 0.01\n(B) 0.001\n(C) 0.02\n(D) 0.0001",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the mode of inheritance of the condition. The fact that it is X-linked means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X-chromosome.\n\nNext, we need to know that males have only one X-chromosome while females have two X-chromosomes. This means that females can either be homozygous recessive (affected), heterozygous (carrier), or homozygous dominant (unaffected).\n\nSince the condition is X-linked recessive, males can only be affected if they inherit the recessive gene on their one X-chromosome. Therefore, the frequency of affected males will be equal to the frequency of the recessive gene in the population, which is given as 0.10.\n\nFemales, on the other hand, can be affected in two ways: (1) if they inherit the recessive gene on both X-chromosomes (homozygous recessive), or (2) if they inherit the recessive gene on one X-chromosome and a dominant gene on the other X-chromosome (heterozygous carriers).\n\nTo calculate the frequency of affected females, we need to use the Hardy-Weinberg equation. The equation is p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\nSince the condition is X-linked recessive, q represents the frequency of the recessive gene in the population, which we already know is 0.10. To find p, we subtract the frequency of q from 1, which gives us 0.90.\n\nNow we can use the equation to find the frequency of homozygous recessive females (q^2) and heterozygous carrier females (2pq). \n\nq^2 = (0.10)^2 = 0.01\n2pq = 2(0.90)(0.10) = 0.18\n\nThe total frequency of affected females (homozygous recessive + heterozygous carriers) is the sum of these two frequencies:\n\n0.01 + 0.18 = 0.19\n\nTherefore, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.19, which is closest to answer choice (C) 0.02. \n\n(C)",

            "model_answer": "Malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is a rare, life-threatening condition that can occur during general anesthesia. It is caused by an abnormal reaction to certain medications used for anesthesia, which trigger a sudden and severe increase in body temperature and muscle contractions. \n\nTo determine the pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia, we need to consider the following factors: \n\n1. Is the condition more common in males or females?\n2. Do both parents need to carry the gene for the condition to be passed on to their children?\n3. If one parent has the gene, what is the likelihood that their children will inherit the condition? \n\nMalignant hyperthermia affects males and females equally, which suggests that the gene responsible for the condition is not located on the X chromosome. \n\nThe fact that malignant hyperthermia can be triggered by certain medications also suggests that it is not an autosomal recessive condition. Autosomal recessive conditions require two copies of the gene, one from each parent, to be inherited, and are not usually triggered by external factors like medications. \n\nTherefore, we can eliminate options B and D. \n\nMalignant hyperthermia is known to have a strong genetic component, with affected individuals having a 50% chance of passing on the condition to their children. This suggests that it is an autosomal dominant condition. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) autosomal dominant.",

            "model_answer": "Option (B) proceeded much more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available.\n\nThe first option (A) is incorrect because mapping of human chromosomes was not restricted to sex chromosomes due to small family sizes. The mapping of all human chromosomes was initiated by studying familial genetic disorders such as Huntington's disease and cystic fibrosis, which are not limited to sex chromosomes.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because it is the opposite of reality. The number of linkage groups is twice the number of chromosomes in lower organisms, but in humans and other mammals, the number of linkage groups is equal to the number of chromosomes.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because almost all of the DNA is not involved in coding for genes. In fact, only about 2% of human DNA codes for proteins, while the remaining 98% is non-coding DNA, which may have other functions.\n\nOption (B) is the correct answer because the mapping of human chromosomes proceeded more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available. The development of many DNA markers, such as polymorphic microsatellites, allowed for the precise mapping of human genes and the identification of disease-causing mutations.",

The question asks which parental exposures can result in intergenerational transmission to offspring. \n\nOption (A) war refers to exposure to violent conflict and trauma, which has been shown to result in psychological and physiological changes that can be passed down to offspring. Studies have found that children of war veterans or Holocaust survivors are more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, suggesting intergenerational transmission of these conditions.\n\nOption (B) natural disasters refer to exposure to traumatic events like earthquakes, hurricanes, or floods. Similar to war, parental experiences of natural disasters have been associated with increased risk for mental health problems in their children.\n\nOption (C) hunger refers to experiences of food insecurity and malnutrition, which can contribute to poor health outcomes in both parents and offspring. Studies have found that maternal malnutrition during pregnancy can increase the risk of adverse health outcomes in offspring, such as obesity and cardiovascular disease.\n\nTaken together, all of these conditions have been associated with intergenerational transmission of health and psychosocial outcomes.
