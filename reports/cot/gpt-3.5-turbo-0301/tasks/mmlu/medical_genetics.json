            "model_answer": "Step 1: Start by identifying that this is an X-linked recessive condition, which means it is carried on the X chromosome.\n\nStep 2: Remember that males only have one X chromosome, so if they inherit a recessive allele for this condition, they will be affected.\n\nStep 3: Females have two X chromosomes, so they can be carriers of the condition without being affected unless they inherit two copies of the recessive allele.\n\nStep 4: Use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to calculate the expected frequency of affected females: \n\np^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1\n\nWhere p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\nStep 5: We know that the frequency of affected males is 0.10, which means that q^2 = 0.10. Solving for q gives us:\n\nq = sqrt(0.10) = 0.316\n\nStep 6: Since this is an X-linked recessive condition, the frequency of affected females is equal to the frequency of homozygous recessive females (q^2) plus half the frequency of heterozygous females (pq). So:\n\nq^2 + 0.5(2pq) = q^2 + pq\n\nSubstituting in the value we just found for q:\n\n0.10 + 0.316 * 0.684 = 0.3051\n\nStep 7: Round the answer to two decimal places and convert to a percentage: \n\n0.3051 = 30.51%\n\nStep 8: The answer is (C) 0.02.",

Mapping of autosomes has also been done despite smaller family sizes in some cases.\n- Option (C) is incorrect because the number of linkage groups is actually the same as the number of chromosomes in humans.\n- Option (D) is incorrect because only a small percentage of DNA actually codes for genes.\n- Option (B) is correct because as more DNA markers (such as SNPs and microsatellites) became available, mapping of human chromosomes became more successful.

Children of war veterans may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other mental health issues. \n\nOption B, natural disasters, is also a possible exposure. Studies have shown that pregnant women who experience natural disasters may be more likely to have children with developmental issues or mental health problems. \n\nOption C, hunger, is another possible exposure that can affect offspring. Malnourishment during pregnancy can lead to low birth weight and other health problems for the baby. \n\nBecause all of these options are possible exposures that can result in intergenerational effects, the answer is (D) all of these.",
