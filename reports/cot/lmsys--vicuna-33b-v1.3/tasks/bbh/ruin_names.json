Not very humorous.\nOption (B) \"hecrbie hancock\" - This option adds an extra \"c\" between the \"h\" and \"e\" in \"herbie\". It's a minor change and not very humorous.\nOption (C) \"herbqe hancock\" - This option replaces the \"h\" in \"herbie\" with \"q\" and adds an extra \"e\" at the end. It's a more noticeable change, but still not very humorous.\nOption (D) \"hejrbie hancock\" - This option replaces the \"h\" in \"herbie\" with \"j\" and adds an extra \"e\" at the end. It's a more noticeable change and slightly humorous.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer\nAfter evaluating the options, the most humorous edit seems to be option (D) \"hejrbie hancock\".

Although it may be amusing, it doesn't seem to be the intended humorous edit.\n\nOption (C): This option removes the space between \"foo\" and \"fighter,\" creating the phrase \"foofighter.\" While this change offers a humorous alteration by merging the words, it doesn't closely resemble the original name, \"Foo Fighters.\"\n\nOption (D): This option changes the first letter of the original name, \"Foo Fighters,\" to \"fyo.\" This alteration results in \"Fyo Fighters,\" which, when read out loud, sounds like \"foo\" and \"fighters\" while still being a distinct word.
