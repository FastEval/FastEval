            "model_answer": "To determine the correct adjective order in the sentence, I will consider the rules of adjective order in English. The rules are as follows:\n\n1. Determiner (e.g., \"the\")\n2. Appearance (e.g., \"color\", \"size\", \"shape\")\n3. Material (e.g., \"wood\", \"metal\", \"plastic\")\n4. Origin (e.g., \"Japanese\", \"French\")\n5. Purpose (e.g., \"chair\", \"table\", \"knife\")\n6. Qualifier (e.g., \"new\", \"old\", \"empty\")\n7. Opinion (e.g., \"beautiful\", \"ugly\", \"funny\")\n\nNow, I will analyze each option:\n\nOption A:\n\n* wonderful (opinion)\n* big (appearance)\n* circular (appearance)\n* orange (appearance)\n* Pakistani (origin)\n* smoking (opinion)\n* car (purpose)\n\nOption B:\n\n* circular (appearance)\n* wonderful (opinion)\n* smoking (opinion)\n* Pakistani (origin)\n* big (appearance)\n* orange (appearance)\n* car (purpose)\n\nIn Option A, \"wonderful\" is an opinion adjective, so it should be placed before \"big\" because it relates to the car itself rather than its appearance. Similarly, \"smoking\" also describes the car itself, so it should be placed before \"Pakistani\".\n\nIn Option B, \"circular\" is placed correctly, but \"wonderful\" is placed after \"smoking\", which is not correct because \"wonderful\" is a stronger opinion than \"smoking\". Also, \"Pakistani\" is placed before \"big\", which is incorrect because the adjective for size should precede the adjective for origin.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct sentence is:\n\n(A) wonderful big circular orange Pakistani smoking car",

Typically, adjectives in English are ordered by: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, and purpose.\n3. In this case, we have two opinions: \"enormous\" and \"brand-new.\" \"Enormous\" is a more negative opinion since it's not a desirable trait for a motorcycle, so it should be placed after the other adjective.\n4. We have two facts: \"drinking\" and \"German.\" \"Drinking\" is more specific, so it should be placed before the more general term, \"German.\"\n5. Now, we have \"brand-new\" and \"enormous\" left, which both describe the size of the motorcycle. Since \"brand-new\" is a temporary state and \"enormous\" is a permanent feature, \"brand-new\" should be placed before \"enormous.\"\n6. Therefore, the correct adjective order should be: \"brand-new,\" \"enormous,\" \"drinking,\" and \"German.\"\n\nFinal answer: B",
