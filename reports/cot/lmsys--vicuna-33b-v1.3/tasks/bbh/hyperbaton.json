In English, we generally put the adjective order in the following order:\n\t* Opinion\n\t* Size\n\t* Age\n\t* Color\n\t* Nationality or origin\n\t* Material or Type\n\t* Purpose or Function\n2. In this case, we need to describe a \"Brazilian sweater\".\n3. The adjectives that describe the sweater are:\n\t* Nationality or origin: Brazilian (B)\n\t* Material or Type: sweater (A, B)\n\t* Color: grey (A, B)\n\t* Age: old (A, B)\n\t* Size: midsize (A, B)\n4. Now we need to decide the order of the adjectives. Since \"Brazilian\" is the most important descriptive factor, it should come first. The rest of the adjectives can follow in the order of the initial list:\n\t* Opinion\n\t* Size\n\t* Age\n\t* Color\n\t* Nationality or origin\n\t* Material or Type\n\t* Purpose or Function\n5.
