We know she couldn't have gone between 11am and 3pm because Michael saw her getting coffee. We also know she couldn't have gone between 3pm and 4pm because James saw her buying clothes.\n\nNext, we need to consider the remaining time slots:\n\n* 4pm to 6pm: This option is only one hour long, and it's too short to account for the different locations where Hannah was seen.\n* 6pm to 8pm: Hannah was already seen walking in the garden during this time slot.\n* 8pm to 9pm: Hannah was already seen sitting on a rooftop during this time slot.\n* 9pm to 10pm: This option is only one hour long, and it's too short to account for the different locations where Hannah was seen. Moreover, the park is closed after 10pm.\n\nBased on the information, we can eliminate all the options except:\n\n(D) 3pm to 4pm\n\nThis option is two hours long, and it's the only time slot during which Hannah was not seen at any other location.
