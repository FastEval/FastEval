This is correct, as both the German \"Stadtteil\" and the English \"district\" refer to a part of a city or town.\n3. \"nordhessischen Kleinstadt Naumburg\" is translated to \"Naumburg in the district of Tossel\". There seems to be an issue with the translation of \"nordhessischen\". While it could be translated to \"northern Hesse\" in the context, the translation does not maintain the same structure as the original sentence. Additionally, \"Kleinstadt\" is translated to \"district\", which is not an accurate translation for the context. The correct translation should preserve the information about Naumburg being a \"northern Hesse\" city and maintain the same structure.\n4.
