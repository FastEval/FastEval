Since Jane started visiting the bookstore on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009, we need to find the first October 16th after 2009.\n\nThe date of the first visit (October 16th) would be:\n\n* 2009: Not applicable\n* 2010: October 16th\n* 2011: October 16th\n* 2012: October 16th\n* 2013: October 16th\n* 2014: October 16th\n* 2015: October 16th\n* 2016: October 16th\n* 2017: October 16th\n* 2018: October 16th\n* 2019: October 16th\n* 2020: October 16th\n* 2021: October 16th\n* 2022: October 16th (last year)\n\nNow, let's find the date one year ago from today. Since it's her 5th visit to the bookstore today, we need to count the number of visits in between the first visit (2022-10-16) and today (2023-02-16).\n\nThere are 10 months between October and February, plus 2 extra months for 2023, so there are a total of 12 months in between.\n\nLet's calculate the number of visits in those 12 months:\n\n* 5 visits (today included)\n* 1 visit (from February 2023 to January 2023)\n* 1 visit (from January 2023 to December 2022)\n* 1 visit (from December 2022 to November 2022)\n* 1 visit (from November 2022 to October 2022)\n* 1 visit (from October 2022 to September 2022)\n\nSo, there are 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 visits in those 12 months.\n\nNow, we need to subtract these 9 visits from the date of the 1st visit (2022-10-16). Since there are 9 visits, each visit is 1 month apart, so it's like subtracting 9 months.\n\n2022-10-16 - 9 months = 2021-05-16. However, this is not a valid date because it's in May, not February.
