The orange book is the second from the left.\n4. The black book is to the right of the yellow book.\n5. The black book is the third from the left.\n\nBased on the information given, we can eliminate options (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) because those options give the second-from-the-right position to the black, yellow, white, or gray books, but none of them can be second from the right based on the given information.\n\nNow, let's consider option (F). If the orange book is the second from the right, then the green book must be the second from the left since it is to the left of the gray book and the orange book is to the right of the gray book. However, the black book is also the second from the left, which contradicts the statement that the orange book is the second from the left. So, option (F) cannot be correct.\n\nFinally, let's consider option (G). If the green book is the second from the right, then the white book must be the second from the left since it is to the left of the gray book and the green book is to the right of the gray book. But this is consistent with the given information that the black book is the third from the left. So, option (G) is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: (G) The green book is the second from the right",

Cantaloupes must be the third-most expensive because apples are less expensive than cantaloupes but more expensive than loquats.\n3. Kiwis must be the most expensive among the fruits because loquats are less expensive than kiwis, and the other fruits are less expensive than loquats.\n\nNow we have the order of the most expensive to least expensive fruits: kiwis, cantaloupes, watermelons, apples, loquats, pears, and plums.\n\nAnswer: (G) The loquats are the most expensive",
