This statement might not be sarcastic as it could be seen as a more positive and supportive message, although it still might not be the most effective way to address depression.\n\nAs we analyze the statements step by step, it seems that Statement A is more likely to be the sarcastic one due to its tone and the way it downplays the complexity of dealing with depression.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

To determine which one is sarcastic, let's consider the following:\n\n1. The phrase \"totally different\" is an indicator of sarcasm. When someone says something is \"totally different,\" they often mean that it is not different at all or that the difference is insignificant.\n2. The words \"urged\" and \"pleaded\" have similar meanings in the context of persuasion or requesting someone to do something. They both imply that there is some level of influence or request being made by the person.\n\nNow, let's consider the difference between \"urged\" and \"pleaded\":\n\n1. \"Urged\" generally carries a more forceful or persuasive connotation than \"pleaded.\" When someone urges another person to do something, they might be more insistent or persistent.\n2. \"Pleaded\" is often associated with a more desperate or begging tone, suggesting that the person is in a more vulnerable or less powerful position.\n\nGiven this analysis, option A seems to be more likely to be sarcastic because the use of \"urged\" in comparison to \"pleaded\" implies a more significant difference. The speaker might be downplaying the difference between the two actions by using \"totally different,\" which, as we noted earlier, is a common indicator of sarcasm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) He didn't threaten, he only urged; totally different",
