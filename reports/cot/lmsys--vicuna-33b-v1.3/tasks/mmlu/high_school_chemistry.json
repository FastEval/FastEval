The solubility depends on the specific ion and solvent. (A) is partially correct, but not always true.\n\n(B) Very electronegative: Monatomic ions are often highly electronegative because they have a large charge-to-size ratio, making them more likely to attract electrons. This option is more accurate than (A) but not entirely correct since not all monatomic ions are very electronegative.\n\n(C) Isoelectronic with a noble gas: A monatomic ion is isoelectronic with a noble gas if it has the same electronic configuration as a noble gas. This is often true for monatomic ions, as they strive to achieve a stable noble gas configuration by gaining or losing electrons.

The ease of dissociation depends on the polarity of the bond between the acidic hydrogen atom and the rest of the molecule. A stronger bond is harder to break, so the acid is weaker. Conversely, a weaker bond is easier to break, making the acid stronger.\n\nNow let's examine the molecular structures of sulfurous acid (H2SO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In sulfurous acid, there are two oxygen atoms attached to the sulfur atom. In sulfuric acid, there are three oxygen atoms attached to the sulfur atom.\n\nWhich of the given choices best explains why the addition of an extra oxygen atom would make sulfuric acid a stronger acid?\n\n(A) suggests that the O\u2013H bonds in sulfuric acid are weaker than in sulfurous acid due to the electron withdrawing effect of the oxygen atoms on sulfuric acid. However, this would actually make the acid weaker, not stronger, since the hydrogen atom would be less likely to dissociate from the molecule.\n(B) claims that sulfuric acid is stronger because it has more oxygen atoms in its formula. This option seems plausible, as the additional oxygen atom could help stabilize the negative charge on the sulfur atom after dissociation, making it easier for the remaining molecule to dissociate.\n(C) proposes that the sulfur in sulfuric acid is more electronegative than the sulfur in sulfurous acid, making it a stronger acid. However, the electronegativity of the sulfur atoms in both molecules is likely to be similar, so this option cannot explain the difference in acid strength.\n(D) states that sulfuric acid has hydrogen atoms bound directly to the sulfur atom, making it a stronger acid. This option is incorrect, as both sulfurous and sulfuric acid have hydrogen atoms bound directly to the sulfur atom.\n\nAfter evaluating the options, (B) seems to be the most plausible explanation, as the additional oxygen atom in sulfuric acid could help stabilize the resulting negative charge on the sulfur atom after dissociation, making it easier for the remaining molecule to dissociate and increasing the acid strength.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) sulfuric acid has more oxygen atoms in its formula",
