            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the estimated yearly yield on the investment, we will consider the following factors:\n\n1. Purchase price of the limousine: $98,000\n2. Rental price per hour: $245\n3. Daily rental hours: 2 hours\n4. Daily operational costs: $50\n5. Estimated number of days of operation per year: 365 (assuming no holidays or weekends)\n\nNow we need to calculate the total yearly revenue and expenses:\n\nTotal yearly revenue = (2 hours/day) \\* (365 days/year) \\* ($245/hour) = 1820 hours/year \\* $245/hour = $449,500/year\n\nTotal yearly expenses = (365 days/year) \\* $50/day = 365 days/year \\* $50/day = $18,250/year\n\nTotal yearly profit = Total yearly revenue - Total yearly expenses = $449,500 - $18,250 = $431,250/year\n\nNow we need to find the yield on the investment:\n\nYearly yield on investment = Total yearly profit / Purchase price of the limousine = $431,250/year / $98,000 = 4.4125\n\nFinally, we need to express the yearly yield as a percentage:\n\nYearly yield on investment (as a percentage) = 4.4125 \\* 100 = 441.25%\n\nThe answer is (D) 441.25%.",

            "question": "Arno Co. did not record a credit purchase of merchandise made prior to year end. However the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory. What effect did the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise have on Arno's balance sheet at year end? Assets Liabilities\n\n(A) No effect No effect\n(B) No effect Understated\n(C) Understated No effect\n(D) Understated Understated",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand how the purchases of merchandise are typically recorded in a company's accounting records. When a company purchases merchandise on credit, it will record the purchase as an increase in an assets account (such as Inventory or Merchandise) and a decrease in a liabilities account (such as Accounts Payable or Credit Purchases).\n\nNow let's analyze the given situation:\n\n1. Arno Co. did not record the credit purchase of merchandise prior to year end.\n2. The merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory.\n\nBased on the information provided, it appears that the merchandise purchased on credit was included in the physical inventory count, but the accounting records did not reflect the purchase.\n\nSince the merchandise was included in the physical inventory, the assets side of the balance sheet will show the correct value of inventory at year end. However, the liabilities side will not reflect the correct amount for the accounts payable/credit purchases, as it was not recorded in the accounting records.\n\nSo, the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise on credit affected the balance sheet as follows:\n\n* Assets: No effect (the inventory was correctly recorded)\n* Liabilities: Understated (the accounts payable/credit purchases were not recorded)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Understated No effect.",

It refers to the risk that the auditor's conclusions may differ if they tested every item in the population instead of using a sample. This risk arises when the auditor performs a substantive test on a sample instead of the entire population.\n\n(B) This statement describes a form of nonsampling risk. Nonsampling risk can arise due to an auditor's failure to recognize misstatements. This is a possible shortcoming of the auditor and is distinct from the risk associated with using a sample.\n\n(C) This statement describes sampling risk. Sampling risk arises from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. It is about the uncertainty or error that can occur when applying audit procedures to a sample.\n\n(D) This statement also describes a form of sampling risk. It mentions the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. This means that the auditor might use a procedure that doesn't fit the purpose of the test or the nature of the risk being assessed.\n\nSo, which statement is correct for a nonissuer?\n\n(A) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\nThe correct answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "First, I will explain my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the concept of \"subsequent events\": Subsequent events refer to events that occur between the balance sheet date and the date the financial statements are issued. These events may affect the financial statements and should be evaluated by the auditor.\n2. Understand the objective of the auditor regarding subsequent events: The auditor's objective is to determine whether any subsequent events require adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements.\n3. Analyze each option:\n(A) This option involves inspecting inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end. This event might affect the financial statements, but it is not a direct focus of the auditor's subsequent events procedure, which is to evaluate events that occurred after the balance sheet date.\n(B) This option involves testing internal control activities previously reported as inadequate. While it may be relevant to the audit, it does not specifically address subsequent events.\n(C) This option involves reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end. This procedure helps the auditor verify the accuracy and completeness of cash balances and transactions during the relevant period.\n(D) This option involves comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited. This procedure allows the auditor to determine whether any significant events have occurred since the balance sheet date that may require adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\n4. Conclude the most appropriate option: Based on the reasoning above, the most appropriate option to address the auditor's objective regarding subsequent events is (C).\n\nNow I will provide the answer:\n\n(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.",

This classification indicates that the asset is being prepared for sale in the near future.\n\nB)It will be classified as a current asset.\nSince the company expects to complete the sale within four months, the old building can be considered a current asset. Current assets are those expected to be converted into cash, used, or sold within one year or within the company's normal operating cycle, whichever is longer.\n\nC)It will no longer be depreciated.\nOnce the old building is classified as an asset held for sale, it is no longer depreciated. Depreciation is an accounting method to allocate the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. Since the asset is being sold, its useful life is not applicable for depreciation.\n\nD)It will be valued at historical cost.\nSince the building is actively being marketed for sale, it is likely that the old building will be valued at its historical cost. Historical cost is the original cost of the asset, adjusted for any additional amounts invested or that would have been recovered, including costs of financing.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n(C)It will no longer be depreciated.
