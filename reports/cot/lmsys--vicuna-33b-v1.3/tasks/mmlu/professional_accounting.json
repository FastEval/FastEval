            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the estimated yearly yield on your investment, we need to consider the revenue generated from renting the limousine and the daily costs.\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the total number of rental hours in a year. There are 365 days in a year, but we need to account for weekends and festivities when demand for limousine rentals is likely to be higher. Assuming 52 weeks in a year, with 2 weeks of festivities when the limousine is rented for 4 hours per day, we have a total of:\n\n365 days + 2 weeks \\* 4 hours/day = 365 + 8 \\* 4 = 432 hours/year\n2. Next, we need to calculate the yearly revenue from renting the limousine. There are:\n\n2 hours/day \\* 432 hours/year = 864 rental hours/year\n\nThe revenue per hour is $245, so:\n\nYearly revenue = 864 hours \\* $245/hour = $214,220/year\n3. Now we need to calculate the yearly costs. There are:\n\n365 days/year \\* $50/day = $18,250/year\n\n1. To find the estimated yearly yield on your investment, subtract the yearly costs from the yearly revenue and divide by the initial cost of the limousine:\n\nYearly yield = Yearly revenue - Yearly costs / Initial cost\nYearly yield = ($214,220 - $18,250) / $98,000\nYearly yield = $196,570 / $98,000\nYearly yield = 2\n\nThe answer is (B) 1.64%.",

The balance sheet consists of assets, liabilities, and equity.\n\nWhen a company purchases merchandise on credit, it increases both an asset (Merchandise or Inventory) and a liability (Accounts Payable or Credit Accounts Payable). Since the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory, the inventory asset is accurately reported.\n\nHowever, the liability side is not affected by the physical inventory. The omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise means that the Accounts Payable or Credit Accounts Payable was not recorded. This leads to an understatement of the liability.\n\nSo, the effect of not recording the purchase of merchandise on the balance sheet is:\n\n(C) Understated No effect",

This is indeed a risk associated with audit sampling.\n\n(B) This statement also refers to nonsampling risk, specifically that the auditor may fail to recognize misstatements. This is a risk that can be associated with audit sampling, but it is not specific to sampling and can arise in other scenarios as well.\n\n(C) This statement refers to sampling risk, which arises from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. This statement describes a characteristic of sampling risk, but it does not explicitly mention it as a risk associated with audit sampling.\n\n(D) This statement refers to a possibility of selecting inappropriate audit procedures, which can lead to incorrect conclusions. This statement primarily refers to a risk associated with the selection of audit procedures rather than sampling risk.\n\nGiven these explanations, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we will first need to understand the differences between the straight-line method and the effective interest method for amortizing premiums on bonds.\n\nThe straight-line method of amortization involves equal periodic interest amounts over the life of the bond, while the effective interest method allocates interest expense based on the interest rate and the time-weighted average of the outstanding bond balance.\n\nWhen a bond is issued at a premium, the premium is amortized to interest expense over the life of the bond. Using the straight-line method would result in a faster amortization of the premium compared to the effective interest method. This means that less interest expense would be recognized under the straight-line method.\n\nNow, let's analyze the effect of this error on the given items at June 30 year 12:\n\n1. Bond carrying amount: The straight-line method would understate the interest expense, which would overstate the bond carrying amount at June 30 year 12.\n2. Retained earnings: The understatement of interest expense would result in an overstatement of retained earnings at June 30 year 12.\n\nSo, the error affects the bond carrying amount and retained earnings as follows:\n\n(B) Understated Overstated\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n(B)",

In a C corporation, the corporation itself istaxed on its taxable income, and then the shareholders are taxed on any dividends they receive from the corporation.\n2. In an S corporation, the corporation's taxable income or losses flow through to the shareholders, who report these on their individual tax returns. Shareholders are taxed on their proportionate share of the S corporation's income, whether or not the income is actually distributed to them.\n\nGiven this information and the provided data, we can calculate the taxable income that Carson would have reported if the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions were proportionate.\n\nCarson owned 40% of the outstanding stock of the corporation. Therefore, Carson's proportionate share of the $400,000 taxable income would be:\n\n40% \\* $400,000 = $160,000\n\nNow, we need to consider the actual cash dividends distributed, which were $70,000. Since the dividends were proportionate, we can assume that Carson received $70,000 \\* 40% = $28,000 in cash dividends.\n\nTo determine the taxable income Carson would have reported on their individual return if the corporation had been an S corporation, we need to subtract the cash dividends from the proportionate share of the taxable income:\n\n$160,000 - $28,000 = $132,000\n\nTherefore, Carson would have reported $132,000 in taxable income if the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions were proportionate.\n\nThe answer is (B) $132,000.",
