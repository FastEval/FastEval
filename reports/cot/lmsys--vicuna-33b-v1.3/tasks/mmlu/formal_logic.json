The passage discusses the difficulty of recognizing and dealing with emotional weaknesses in ourselves and others, as observed in everyday patients.\n2. The arrogance of consciousness is mentioned as a defense mechanism that blocks the recognition of unconscious complexes.\n3. The author suggests that it is challenging to convince people of the existence of the unconscious and to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n4. The conclusion of the argument is that it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious and to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",
