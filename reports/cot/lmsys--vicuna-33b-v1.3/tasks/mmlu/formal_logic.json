It could be a premise for a further argument.\n\n(B) The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.\nThis option is a statement about the arrogance of consciousness blocking unconscious complexes. While it may relate to the difficulty of convincing people about the unconscious, it is not the main conclusion drawn from the passage.\n\n(C) Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\nThis option presents a cause-and-effect relationship: the arrogance of consciousness blocking unconscious complexes leads to difficulties in convincing people about the unconscious and teaching them what their conscious knowledge contradicts. This statement best captures the main conclusion of the argument.\n\n(D) It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\nThis option is a restatement of the conclusion from option (C), which focuses on the difficulty in convincing people and teaching them about the unconscious when their conscious knowledge may contradict it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C).",
