Confidence intervals are used to estimate the unknown value of a parameter, such as the population mean, in a sample.\n2. A confidence interval is considered \"99% confident\" if, in repeated sampling, it would contain the true parameter value 99% of the time.\n3. This property is independent of whether the null hypothesis is true or false. Instead, it focuses on the accuracy of the estimated interval in capturing the true parameter value.\n4. Choices (B) and (D) are incorrect because they are concerned with the estimated value of the parameter or the rejection of the null hypothesis, respectively, which are not the primary goal of a confidence interval.\n5. Choice (C) is also incorrect because it refers to the rejection of the null hypothesis, which is not the purpose of a confidence interval.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand what the leverage effect is in finance. The leverage effect refers to the phenomenon where the sensitivity of a financial instrument's price to changes in its underlying asset's value increases as the instrument's value decreases. In other words, the leverage effect causes the Relative Price (RP) of a financial instrument to become more sensitive to news when the instrument's value is lower.\n\nNow let's consider the news impact curve, which represents the Relative Price (RP) as a function of news (or information). Given that the leverage effect makes the RP more sensitive to news when the instrument's value is lower, the news impact curve would show a steeper slope for negative deviations (when the instrument's value is lower) compared to positive deviations (when the instrument's value is higher).\n\nConsidering these points, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) It would rise more quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude",

The linear probability model is a regression model where the dependent variable is a binary indicator, taking the value 1 if an event occurs and 0 if it does not.\n2. Typically, the linear probability model does not have constraints to ensure that the estimated probabilities lie between 0 and 1. This can lead to issues when interpreting the model's predictions.\n3. Truncating the probabilities at 0 and 1 will reduce the problem of estimating probabilities outside the (0, 1) range, but it doesn't guarantee that there will be no observations with exactly 0 or 1 probabilities.\n4. The error terms in a linear probability model are likely to be heteroscedastic and not normally distributed. This is because the probability of observing an event is a non-linear transformation of the model's coefficients, leading to non-normal and potentially highly variable residuals.\n5. While the linear probability model can be harder to interpret due to the issues mentioned in the previous points, it is generally easier to estimate than a model with a continuous dependent variable. This is because estimating a binary probability directly is simpler than trying to model the probability of a continuous outcome.",
