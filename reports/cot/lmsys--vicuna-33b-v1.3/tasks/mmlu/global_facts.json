            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to follow a few steps:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the meaning of \"overweight\". The World Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 25. The BMI is calculated using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2.\n2. Next, we need to find the population data for adults aged 18 years or older. We can use the United States Census data as a reference, as it's available up to 2020. However, the question specifically asks about the 2016 data, so we need to find this information from another source.\n3. Once we have the population data, we can convert the number of overweight adults to a percentage of the total adult population aged 18 or older.\n4. After we have the percentage, we can then compare it to the given options (A) 10%, (B) 20%, (C) 40%, and (D) 80%) to find the correct answer.\n\nThe answer is (C) 40%.",
