GDP per capita is a measure of a country's average income, calculated by dividing the country's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) by its population.\n\nNext, we need to find data on Japan's GDP per capita for 1950 and 2016. Since we're controlling for inflation and PPP-adjustment, we should look for data that has already been adjusted for these factors. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank are good sources for this information.\n\nOnce we have the data, we can compare the GDP per capita figures for 1950 and 2016. To find the increase in GDP per capita, we will subtract the 1950 figure from the 2016 figure.\n\nFinally, we'll identify the options that most closely match the result of our calculation.

According to the World Health Organization, in 2020, the leading causes of death in children under five were:\n\n(B) Preterm birth complications\n(C) Pneumonia\n\nAlthough diarrheal diseases were still a significant cause of death, they were not the leading cause in 2020.
