They work by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the data into different classes. This hyperplane is defined based on the kernel function, which can be linear, polynomial, or any other valid kernel. SVMs use a decision function to classify new data points. However, SVMs do not directly give a probability distribution over the possible labels. They provide a binary decision, indicating which class the data point belongs to.\n\nStatement 2:\nWhen we move from a linear kernel to higher-order polynomial kernels in SVMs, the underlying algorithm remains the same, but the kernel function changes. The kernel function is responsible for mapping the input space to a high-dimensional space, where the decision boundary can be easily found. Higher-order polynomial kernels can capture more complex decision boundaries compared to linear kernels. In general, we would expect the support vectors to change when switching from a linear kernel to a higher-order polynomial kernel.\n\nNow, let's answer the question:\n\n(B) False, False",

We'll use the formula for combinations, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n2. For the first attribute with 3 possible values, we can use the formula:\n\nC(3, 1) = 3! / (1!(3-1)!) = 3\n3.
