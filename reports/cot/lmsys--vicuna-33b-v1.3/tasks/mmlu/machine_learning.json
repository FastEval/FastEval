They can have any sign, depending on the specific data, the constructed decision trees, and how the weights are updated.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements together:\n\n* Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 can be False.\n* Linear regression can have the smallest variance, but there's no guarantee that the coefficients in AdaBoost are always non-negative.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(D) False, True",

Statement 1: Support vector machines, like logistic regression models, give a probability distribution over the possible labels given an input example.\n\nMy reasoning: Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of binary classification model. SVMs work by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes. So, they do not directly give a probability distribution over the possible labels. However, there are some kernels, such as the Gaussian kernel, that can be used with SVMs to implicitly determine the probability of an example belonging to one class or the other. So, this statement is partly true.\n\nNow let's address the second statement:\n\n1. Statement 2: We would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels.\n\nMy reasoning: The support vectors are the data points that have the most influence on the position of the hyperplane in SVMs. When we move from a linear kernel to a higher order polynomial kernel, the decision boundary becomes more complex. This change in the decision boundary can lead to different support vectors being chosen.

Convolutional Networks (CNNs): CNNs are designed to handle image data and can efficiently process high-resolution images. They capture local patterns and hierarchical features through convolutional layers and pooling layers. Their performance in image classification tasks, including high-resolution images, has been proven to be superior.\n2. Graph Networks: These networks are primarily used for graph-based data, where nodes and edges represent entities and relationships between them. While they can be adapted for image classification, they are not specifically designed for images and may not be the best choice for classifying high-resolution images.\n3. Fully Connected Networks: Fully connected networks, also known as dense networks, can be used for image classification. However, they have a high number of parameters, making them computationally expensive and difficult to train for high-resolution images.\n4. RBF Networks: Radial basis function networks are a type of neural network with a specific architecture, where the activation functions are radial basis functions.

            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each statement individually:\n\nStatement 1: The log-likelihood of the data will always increase through successive iterations of the expectation maximization algorithm.\n\nExplanation: The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative algorithm used for maximum likelihood estimation in parametric models with unobserved variables. It alternates between two steps: computing the expected values of the latent variables (E-step) and updating the parameters to maximize the expected complete-data log-likelihood (M-step).\n\nThe E-step aims to find the expected value of the latent variables, which is a function of the current parameters. The M-step updates the parameters to maximize the complete-data log-likelihood, which is the sum of the log-likelihood of the observed data and the expected log-likelihood of the latent variables.\n\nGiven that the M-step optimizes the log-likelihood, and the E-step provides a better approximation of the latent variables each iteration, it's reasonable to expect that the log-likelihood of the data will increase through successive iterations.\n\nStatement 2: One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment.\n\nExplanation: Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm used to estimate the optimal action-value function, i.e., the expected total reward for each action in a given state. It updates the action-value function by taking the action with the highest estimated Q-value and observing the subsequent reward and state change.\n\nHowever, Q-learning doesn't require prior knowledge of how actions affect the environment. It learns the best actions through exploration and exploitation, updating the Q-values based on the experienced rewards and state transitions.\n\nNow, let's combine the analysis of both statements:\n\n(A) True, True\nBoth statements are true. The EM algorithm indeed increases the log-likelihood through iterations, and Q-learning does not require prior knowledge of the environment's response to actions.\n\n(B) False, False\nBoth statements are false.

In each iteration, it takes a step in the direction of the negative gradient, which is the direction of greatest decrease of the cost function.\n\n1. Compute the gradient: First, we need to compute the gradient of the cost function, which requires calculating partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to each input (D dimensions). The cost of this computation is O(D).\n2. Update the parameters: Next, we use the computed gradient to update the parameters of the model. This usually involves multiplying the gradient with a learning rate (alpha) and adding the result to the current model parameters. The computation here involves D scalar multiplications and D vector additions.

This statement is about continuous random variables and their probability distribution functions. The statement says that for all values of x, the probability distribution function p(x) is always between 0 and 1. This statement is True.\n\nReasoning for Statement 1: Probability distribution functions for continuous random variables are non-negative and integrate to 1, so they must be between 0 and 1 for all values of the random variable.\n\nStep 2: Now let's consider Statement 2. This statement is about decision trees and the way they are learned. The statement claims that decision trees are learned by minimizing information gain. However, this statement is False.
