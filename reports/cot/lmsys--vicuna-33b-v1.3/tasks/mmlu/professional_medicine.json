            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the patient's medical history and the symptoms she is experiencing. The patient had a pulmonary embolism, needed hospital treatment for 3 weeks, and had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage. She also had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Currently, she has a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness in her left thigh, which has improved somewhat during the past week. The only medication she is taking is warfarin.\n\nNext, we need to assess the symptoms and their possible causes. The sensation of tingling and numbness could be related to the pulmonary embolism, the retroperitoneal hemorrhage, the IVC filter placement, or the hematoma of the left thigh. We also need to consider the medication she is taking (warfarin) and its possible side effects.\n\nNow let's review the potential causes one by one:\n\n1. Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization: This is unlikely since the patient's symptoms are localized to the left thigh, and there are no other reported neurological symptoms.\n2. Complication of the IVC filter placement: While it is a possible cause, the patient's symptoms have improved over the past week, which would be unusual for a serious IVC filter complication.\n3. Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve: This cause aligns with the patient's symptoms, which include decreased sensation to light touch on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh.\n4. Hematoma of the left thigh: While the patient had a hematoma in the past, the sensation has improved over the past week, which suggests it is not the primary cause of her current symptoms.\n\nConsidering the patient's history, symptoms, and the observed improvement, the most likely cause of the decreased sensation is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.\n\nAnswer: (C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.",

            "model_answer": "Before I provide the answer, let me explain my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The patient is 25 years old and gravida 3 para 2, which means this is her third pregnancy and she has had two previous successful deliveries.\n2. She is admitted to the hospital at 39 weeks' gestation in active labor.\n3. She was having regular contractions every 4 minutes, but now they are intermittent and weak.\n4. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours.\n5. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor.\n6. The fetal head is engaged, membranes are intact, fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated.\n\nBased on this information, we can eliminate some options:\n\n* Option A (Braxton Hicks contractions) can be ruled out because the patient is in active labor, not in the third trimester, and contractions are weak and intermittent, not regular and painless.\n* Option B (lower uterine retraction ring) can be ruled out because there are no signs of obstructed labor.\n\nNow, considering the remaining options:\n\n* Option C (hypotonic uterine dysfunction) is a possibility, as the patient's contractions have decreased in frequency and strength, which could indicate a less effective uterine contraction.\n* Option D (primary dysfunctional labor) is also a possibility, as the patient has received pain medicine, which could interfere with labor progress. Additionally, the decreased contractions may indicate that the labor is not progressing effectively.\n\nConsidering both options and the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n(C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction\n\nHowever, it is important to note that a healthcare professional should evaluate the patient and make the final diagnosis based on their clinical judgment and the patient's specific situation.",

            "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of a low-grade fever, cough, and runny nose. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04).

The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug is 6.4 days, and for patients receiving the placebo, it's 6.7 days.\n2. The difference between the two groups is 0.3 days, which is a reduction in time for the new drug group.\n3. The difference is statistically significant (p=0.04), which means it's unlikely to have occurred by chance.\n\nThe next step is to determine if this difference is clinically significant. To do this, we need to consider the clinical context and the potential impact on patients. A reduction of 0.3 days in the mean time for resolution of symptoms could be considered beneficial, as it could lead to less discomfort and earlier return to normal activities for patients.\n\nHowever, the difference is very small, and it might not be noticeable for most patients. Some might argue that it's not clinically significant.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate interpretation of these study results is:\n\n(B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant.",

She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the role of malonyl-CoA in muscle metabolism and its effects on different processes.\n\n1. Malonyl-CoA is a product of the breakdown of fatty acids.\n2. It serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of fatty acids, which is known as fatty acid synthesis.\n3. Malonyl-CoA also plays a role in regulating the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), an enzyme that controls the movement of fatty acids into mitochondria for fatty acid oxidation.\n4. When malonyl-CoA levels are high, CPT1 activity is inhibited, which decreases fatty acid oxidation.\n5. In the presence of high glucose and insulin levels, the body will preferentially use glucose for energy, which will lead to reduced demand for fatty acid oxidation.\n6. Under these conditions, there is no need for the body to synthesize more fatty acids, so the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis due to high malonyl-CoA levels will not be a direct effect of the increased malonyl-CoA concentration.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Fatty acid oxidation",
