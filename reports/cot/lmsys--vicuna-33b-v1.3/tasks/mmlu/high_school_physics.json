And the wave speed is related to the wavelength.\n\nThe wave speed in a string is given by the formula:\n\nwave speed = ( frequency \\* (2 \\* pi) / wavelength ) \\* (string tension / mass per unit length)\n\nNow, as we increase the tension in the string, the string tension term in the formula increases.

Since the frequency of the generator is fixed at 100 Hz, we can rearrange the formula to find the wavelength:\n\nwavelength = (2 \\* pi \\* frequency) / (wave speed)\n\nAs the tension increases, the wave speed increases, which leads to a decrease in wavelength.
