            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to identify which initiative of the given options was associated with desegregation of schools, and specifically, which one had unfulfilled promises related to desegregation.\n\nFirst, let's look at the Brown v. Board of Education, 1954 case, which ruled that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal and thus, violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This ruling played a significant role in the desegregation of schools.\n\nNow, we'll consider each option in the provided answer choices:\n\nA. The Great Society: This initiative was put forth by President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s, aiming to address social issues such as education, healthcare, and civil rights. While it did include educational reforms, it was not directly related to desegregation, as Brown v. Board of Education had already addressed that issue.\n\nB. The Square Deal: This was an initiative by President Theodore Roosevelt at the beginning of the 20th century, focusing on curbing corporate power, promoting conservation, and ensuring a \"square deal\" for all Americans. It did not focus on desegregation, as it predates the Brown v. Board of Education case.\n\nC. The New Deal: This was a series of programs implemented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression, focusing on relief, recovery, and reform. While the New Deal included some civil rights provisions, it did not specifically address the issue of desegregation, as it happened before the Brown v. Board of Education case.\n\nD. Reconstruction: This era took place after the Civil War, aiming to rebuild the country and integrate freed slaves into society. The Reconstruction period saw the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, which included the equal protection clause. However, the desegregation of schools was not fully achieved during the Reconstruction era, and it wasn't until the Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954 that separate but equal was ruled unconstitutional.\n\nSince the Brown v. Board of Education case was a response to the unfulfilled promises of the \"Reconstruction\" era, the correct answer is (D).",

They are an example of nativism, as they targeted certain groups of immigrants.\n\n(C) The Espionage Act of 1917: This act was designed to suppress espionage and other related activities during World War I.
