            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what factors contribute to a successful marathon run.\n\n1. Strength: While having strong muscles is important for any athlete, it is not the key attribute for marathon running. Marathon runners typically focus on endurance rather than strength-based exercises.\n2. Power: Power is also important for athletes, but it is not the most crucial factor for success in marathon running. Marathon running requires sustained effort over a long distance, placing more emphasis on stamina and endurance.\n3. Stride length: Having an efficient stride is beneficial for any runner, but it is not the key attribute for successful marathon running. Marathon runners often focus on optimizing their energy consumption and maintaining a consistent pace throughout the race.\n4. Stamina: Stamina, or the ability to sustain prolonged physical effort, is the key attribute for successful marathon running. A marathon is a long-distance race that requires runners to manage their energy, maintain a consistent pace, and overcome fatigue over the course of several hours.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(D) stamina.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which of the symptoms is not associated with anaphylaxis, let's first briefly explain what anaphylaxis is. Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds to minutes of exposure to an allergen. It is characterized by the sudden onset of various symptoms including:\n\n1. Skin symptoms: Hives, itching, swelling (edema), and a red, raised rash called \"wheal and flare.\"\n2. Respiratory symptoms: Shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, coughing, chest tightness, and stridor (a high-pitched noise during breathing, indicating airway constriction).\n3. Cardiovascular symptoms: Low blood pressure (hypotension), weak pulse (bradycardia or tachycardia), and in severe cases, shock (resulting from a drop in blood pressure).\n4. Gastrointestinal symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.\n5. Other symptoms: Blocked nose, sneezing, itching, and a sense of impending doom.\n\nNow, let's analyze each of the given options:\n\n(A) Stridor: This is a respiratory symptom associated with anaphylaxis, as it involves airway constriction.\n(B) Bradycardia: This is a cardiovascular symptom, characterized by a slow heart rate, which can occur during anaphylaxis.\n(C) Severe wheeze: This is also a respiratory symptom, often accompanied by shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.\n(D) Rash: This is a skin symptom, and it is typical for anaphylaxis, presenting as hives, itching, swelling, and a red, raised rash called \"wheal and flare.\"\n\nAfter analyzing the options, none of them can be considered NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we must first analyze the context and the terms provided.\n\n1. Sprints: Short, intense bursts of physical activity that rely primarily on anaerobic metabolism.\n2. Anaerobic contribution: The use of anaerobic energy systems in muscle energy metabolism during sprints.\n3. pH of the muscle: A measure of the acidity or alkalinity in muscle tissue, which can be influenced by the presence of hydrogen ions (H+) produced during energy metabolism.\n4. Blood glucose concentration: The amount of glucose in the blood, which is an important fuel for muscle cells.\n5. Relative contribution of aerobic metabolism: The extent to which aerobic energy systems are utilized in muscle energy metabolism during sprints.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between these factors and the increasing number of sprints:\n\n(A) An increasing number of sprints would mean an increased demand for energy, which could be provided by anaerobic metabolism. As a result, the anaerobic contribution to muscle energy metabolism would progressively increase.\n\n(B) During intense anaerobic activity, such as sprinting, there is an increased production of hydrogen ions (H+), which can lower the muscle pH. However, the statement does not explicitly mention the pH falling below 6.0, and the pH of muscle tissue is usually not directly measured in practice.\n\n(C) Blood glucose concentration is not directly related to the number of sprints. The body maintains blood glucose within a relatively stable range, and it is not significantly affected by the number of sprints unless there is a much longer duration of intense exercise or an underlying metabolic disorder.\n\n(D) As the number of sprints increases, the duration and intensity of the exercise also increase, which may lead to a greater reliance on aerobic metabolism to meet the energy demands. Thus, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism would increase in comparison to anaerobic metabolism.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.",

The statements provided are:\n\n(A) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered\n(B) The outer image is always the false image\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint\n\nNow, I will explain my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Diplopia can occur due to ocular misalignment, which can happen in cases like strabismus, cataract, refractive errors, or other ocular diseases.\n2. To understand the statements, we need to know how the eyes focus on an object. In normal vision, both eyes should point at the same object to form a single image in the brain. If the eyes do not align correctly, the brain receives two images, leading to diplopia.\n3. statement (A) is incorrect because covering one eye can still cause diplopia if the other eye's alignment is the issue.\n4. Statement (B) is incorrect because there's no guarantee which image will be considered real or false by the brain. It depends on the individual's perception and brain processing.\n5. Statement (C) is about a \"fourth nerve palsy.\" The fourth cranial nerve, or trochlear nerve, is responsible for the superior oblique muscle that moves the eye downward and inward. If this nerve is affected (palsy), it can cause vertical diplopia when looking upwards, but it doesn't necessarily happen only when looking upwards.\n6. Statement (D) is incorrect because a sixth nerve palsy (abducens nerve) causes a different type of squint called a lateral rectus palsy, resulting in an eye drifting outward, not causing a divergent squint.\n\nBased on my reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, I will first consider the role of sodium bicarbonate in the human body and its effects on the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid. Then, I'll analyze the impact of these effects on middle distance running performance. Finally, I'll match the underlying mechanism to the given options.\n\n1. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is a molecule that can help the body maintain a stable pH by acting as a buffer.\n2. When ingested, it breaks down into sodium (Na+), bicarbonate (HCO3-), and carbon dioxide (CO2).\n3. The body produces hydrogen ions (H+) as a byproduct of metabolic processes, causing the pH to drop. Ingested sodium bicarbonate can help counteract this drop by releasing bicarbonate (HCO3-), which can combine with hydrogen ions to form water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2).\n4. The effect of sodium bicarbonate ingestion on pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid depends on whether it can increase the concentration of bicarbonate ions in the blood.\n5. If the ingestion of sodium bicarbonate does increase the bicarbonate concentration in the blood, it will help improve the buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid and raise the pH.\n\nNow, I'll analyze the given options in light of the above reasoning:\n\n(A) elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle. - This option aligns with the reasoning above, where sodium bicarbonate ingestion increases the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid, allowing for a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle tissue.\n\n(B) reducing the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle. - This option is the opposite of the actual effect of sodium bicarbonate ingestion on the extracellular fluid.\n\n(C) elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster influx of hydrogen ions into muscle. - This option implies that sodium bicarbonate ingestion would increase the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid, which would facilitate the influx of hydrogen ions into muscle tissue. However, this is not the intended effect, as the goal is to remove hydrogen ions from muscle tissue to mitigate muscle fatigue.\n\n(D) elevating the pre-exercise muscle pH. - While sodium bicarbonate ingestion can increase the pH of the extracellular fluid, this option does not mention the buffering capacity, which is an essential aspect of the question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the process of fatty acid beta-oxidation and its relation to the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria.\n\n1. Fatty acids are primarily broken down through a process called beta-oxidation, which occurs in the mitochondria of the cell.\n2. Beta-oxidation involves the sequential removal of two-carbon units from the fatty acid, which is bound to a carrier molecule. The carrier molecule shuttles the fatty acid through the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n3. Three molecules are involved in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria:\n(A) thiokinase - This is not a carrier molecule for fatty acids. Thiokinase is an enzyme that converts ATP to AMP, releasing inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) as a byproduct.\n(B) Coenzyme A (CoA) - CoA is a carrier molecule that attaches to the fatty acid, forming athioester. However, it doesn't transport the fatty acid into the mitochondria.\n(C) acetyl-CoA - Acetyl-CoA is not a carrier molecule for fatty acids. It is the product of the first step of beta-oxidation, in which a two-carbon unit is cleaved from the fatty acid.\n(D) carnitine - Carnitine is the molecule responsible for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria. It binds to acyl-CoA esters, forming a larger molecule that can cross the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) carnitine",
