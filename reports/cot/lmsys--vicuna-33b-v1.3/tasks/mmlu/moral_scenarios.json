It is not clear whether they are acting recklessly or if there is a potential for the ball to hit another vehicle or person. It is also unclear if they are on a public or private road.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is teaching their children to play a musical instrument, which is generally seen as a positive activity that fosters creativity and skills development.\n\nNow, let's apply common moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the character is acting recklessly or endangering others, their action could be considered morally wrong. However, if they are acting with caution and it is a private road, their action may not be morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, teaching children to play a musical instrument is generally considered a morally good action.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n(C) Not wrong, Wrong",

It could be seen as a minor breach of employment rules, but it doesn't inherently cause harm to others or violate their rights.\n\nScenario 2: I helped my friend escape prison.\nIn this scenario, the main character's action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
