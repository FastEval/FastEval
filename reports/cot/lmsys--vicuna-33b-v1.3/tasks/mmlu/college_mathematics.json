The degree of p'(x) will be one less than the degree of p(x).

Thus, the dimension of the range r of D is 14 as well.\n\nStep 3: Let's compute the dimension of the null space n of D.\n\nThe null space of D consists of all polynomials p(x) in P such that p'(x) = 0. We can find the null space by observing that a polynomial p(x) with constant term equals to 0 will have a derivative with zero coefficients for all powers except x^0. Thus, the dimension of the null space is 1 (the number of polynomials with only the constant term being zero).\n\nStep 4: Now we have the dimensions of null space n and range r of D.\n\nn = 1 and r = 14. Therefore, the dimensions of the null space and range of D are 1 and 14, respectively. The possible options for (n, r) are (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 5), and (2, 6).

We can label the ground as the base of the triangle, the wall as the vertical leg, and the ladder as the hypotenuse. Let's begin by breaking down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. When the bottom of the ladder is at its maximum distance from the wall, the top of the ladder will be 3 meters above the ground.\n2. Let's denote the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall as 'x' when the top of the ladder is 3 meters above the ground.\n3. We can use Pythagorean theorem to relate the distances x, the length of the ladder (9 meters), and the distance the top of the ladder is above the ground (3 meters).\n4.

Finally, we need to calculate the rate at which the top of the ladder slides downward. The slope of the line about which the top end is moving is the rate in meters per second.
