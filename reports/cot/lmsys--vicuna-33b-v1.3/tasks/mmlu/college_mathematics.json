We can observe that e^x will always be positive for any real value of x, except when x = 0. Therefore, in order for the equation to have real solutions where both e^x and x - 2 are positive, we need e^x to be as small as possible, i.e., when x is around 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the interval [0, 1]. In this interval, e^x will be positive, but x - 2 will be negative for x >= 2. Since e^x is a continuous function and starts increasing as x increases, there will be a point where e^x + x - 2 equals to 0. We can find this point by setting the derivative of e^x + x - 2 to zero.\n\n(e^x)'(x) = e^x \\* ln(e)\n(x - 2)' = 1\n\nNow, we can set both derivatives to zero:\ne^x \\* ln(e) = 1\n\nSolving for x:\nx = ln(e)\n\nThis gives us one solution within the interval [0, 1], but we still need to check if there are any more solutions within the interval.\n\n(1) k = 0 and n = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the number of real solutions of the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0 that are not in the interval [0, 1]. We know that there will be no solutions with x <= 0 or x >= 2, as e^x will be positive and x - 2 will be negative in those intervals.\n\nBetween x = 0 and x = 2, e^x + x - 2 = 0 will have at least one solution since e^x is continuous and changes from positive to negative in this interval.\n\n(2) k = 1 and n = 0\n\n(3) k = n = 1\n\n(4) k > 1\n\nAfter analyzing the options, it seems like option (2) is the correct answer.",

Let's approach this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Determine the possible structures of additive abelian groups of order 16:\n\nThe possible structures are determined by elementary abelian groups. An elementary abelian group of order 16 is isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n(a) C16: The group of integers modulo 16 with addition.\n(b) C8 \u00d7 C2: The direct product of an order 8 cyclic group and an order 2 cyclic group.\n(c) C4 \u00d7 C4: The direct product of two order 4 cyclic groups.\n2.

The elements of this group can be represented as pairs (a, b), where a is in C8 and b is in C2. We need to check if x + x + x + x = 0 for each (a, b) in the group.\n(b.1) If a or b is equal to 0 in the pair (a, b), then the property is satisfied.\n(b.2) If a \u2260 0 and b \u2260 0, and a \u2260 \u00b1b, then x + x + x + x = 0.\n(b.3) If a \u2260 0 and b \u2260 0, and a = \u00b1b, then the property does not hold.\n\nTherefore, the property holds for 8/16 elements in C8 \u00d7 C2.\n(c) C4 \u00d7 C4: In this case, let's represent the elements as pairs (a, b), where a and b are in C4.

Let's first understand the definition of these terms:\n\n* Null space (n): The null space of an operator D is the set of all vectors x for which D(x) = 0. In other words, it's the set of all vectors that are mapped to the zero vector by the operator.\n* Range (r): The range of an operator D is the set of all possible images of input vectors under the operator, i.e., the set of all possible outputs of D.\n\nNow let's examine the given information:\n\n1. The set P consists of polynomials with coefficients in Z\\_5 and degree less than or equal to 7.\n2. The operator D sends a polynomial p(x) in P to its derivative p'(x).\n\nFirst, let's find the dimension of the null space (n). A polynomial of degree 7 has 7 coefficients (0 to 7th degree, plus the constant term). Since the coefficients are in Z\\_5, there are 5 possibilities for each coefficient. Thus, the total number of possibilities for a polynomial in P is 5^7.\n\nNow, let's consider when a polynomial p(x) in P has a derivative p'(x) that is also in P. This occurs when the derivative of a polynomial with coefficients in Z\\_5 and degree less than or equal to 7 is also a polynomial with coefficients in Z\\_5 and degree less than or equal to 7. This condition gives us information about the relationship between the degrees of the parent polynomial and its derivative.\n\nWe need to find how many linearly independent polynomials in P have a derivative that is also in P. This will give us the dimension of the null space of D.\n\n(A) n = 1 and r = 6: Let's consider the polynomials up to degree 6. A degree 6 polynomial has 6 coefficients. Since the coefficients are in Z\\_5, there are 5 possibilities for each coefficient. Thus, there are 5^6 possible degree 6 polynomials in P.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when a degree 6 polynomial has a derivative that is also in P. A degree 6 polynomial can have a degree 5 or lower derivative. There are 5^5 possibilities for a degree 5 polynomial in P, and 5^4 possibilities for a degree 4 polynomial in P. In addition, there are 5^3 possibilities for a degree 3 polynomial in P, and 5^2 possibilities for a degree 2 polynomial in P. Finally, there are 5 possibilities for a degree 1 polynomial in P.\n\nSo, the total number of linearly independent polynomials in P with a derivative that is also in P is 5^6 + 5^5 + 5^4 + 5^3 + 5^2 + 5.\n\nNow, let's find the dimension of the range (r) of D. The range is the set of all possible outputs of D, which is the set of all possible derivatives of polynomials in P. We calculated earlier that there are 5^6 possible degree 6 polynomials in P. Since a degree 6 polynomial can have a degree 5 or lower derivative, there are 5^5 + 5^4 + 5^3 + 5^2 + 5 possibilities for the derivatives.\n\nThe range of D consists of all possible derivatives of polynomials in P, including those that are not in P. However, we know that the dimension of the null space of D is 1, which means that there's an additional constraint that is not accounted for by the degrees of the polynomials.\n\nGiven this, we can conclude that (A) n = 1 and r = 6 is correct.",

This is a curve in the x-y plane, where the product of the x and y coordinates is equal to 8.\n\nWe need to find the shortest distance from this curve to the origin.\n\nTo do that, we should recognize that the distance from a point (x, y) to the origin is given by the formula sqrt((x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2).\n\nSo, we need to find the point on the curve that is closest to the origin, and then calculate the distance by applying the formula above.\n\nNow, we need to find the gradient of the curve, which is given by (y/x).
