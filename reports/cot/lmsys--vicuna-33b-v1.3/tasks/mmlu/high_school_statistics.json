An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The FDA investigator is checking if the mean weight of the aspirin tablets is different from the claimed weight of 300 milligrams.\n2. The null hypothesis is that the mean weight is 300 milligrams, and the alternative hypothesis is that the mean weight is different from 300 milligrams.\n3. The sample size is 7.\n4. The sample data has a range of 299 to 305 milligrams.\n5. To test the hypotheses, we will use a one-sample t-test.\n6. The test will require a pooled standard deviation, which we can estimate using the range of the sample data (305 - 299) / \u221a(7) = 6.16 / \u221a7 \u2248 3.29.\n7. The estimated standard error (SE) of the mean is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (3.29 / \u221a7 \u2248 1.08).\n8. The t-value is the difference between the sample mean and the claimed mean (302.14 - 300) / SE \u2248 (2.14 / 1.08) \u2248 1.94.\n9. The degrees of freedom (df) for the t-distribution are given by the sample size minus one, which is 6.\n10. The p-value is the probability of obtaining a t-value as extreme as or more extreme than the one calculated, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.

The waiting times are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes.\n2. There are 150,000 riders the first summer.\n\nWe are looking for the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders. We can start by calculating the z-score for the mean waiting time.\n\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere x is the mean waiting time for 100,000 riders, and \u03bc is the mean waiting time for one rider.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean waiting time for 100,000 riders. Since there are 150,000 riders in total, the mean waiting time for 50,000 riders would be 50,000/150,000 = 1/3 of the mean waiting time for one rider.\n\nNow, we can calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (1/3 \\* 35 - 35) / 10\nz = -2\n\nSince z is negative, the waiting time will be below the mean for 100,000 riders. Now we need to find the value of x + 3\u03c3, which corresponds to the 99.7% confidence interval.\n\nx + 3\u03c3 = 1/3 \\* 35 + 3 \\* 10\nx + 3\u03c3 = 1/3 \\* 45\nx = 14.33\n\nNow we can find the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders.\n\n(x - 2\u03c3) to (x + 2\u03c3) = (14.33 - 2 \\* 10) to (14.33 + 2 \\* 10) = (-22.66, 48.66)\n\nWe need to round this interval to one-hour intervals, so we round it down to (-23, 48], which corresponds to answer choice (C): 25.3 to 44.7 minutes.",

            "model_answer": "(D) The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. In hypothesis testing, we want to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n2. A hypothesis test is conducted at a specific significance level (\u03b1), which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error).\n3. Statement (A) is false since rejecting the null hypothesis at a lower significance level (e.g., 5%) does not guarantee rejecting it at a higher significance level (e.g., 10%). The p-value or the evidence against the null hypothesis must be considered.\n4. Statement (B) is false because whether to use a one- or two-sided test should be determined before collecting data, as it depends on the research question and the direction of the effect one expects.\n5. Statement (C) is false because the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis is not directly related to the significance level. The significance level is the maximum acceptable probability of making a Type I error, but the actual probability of rejecting the null hypothesis depends on the data and the test statistic.\n6. Statement (D) is true because the power of a test refers to its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis when it is true, and the null hypothesis is false.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, let me explain step-by-step and then provide the answer.\n\nFirstly, the experiment uses a significance level of 0.05. This means that there's a 5% chance of committing a Type I error, which is rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true. The null hypothesis being false means that there's an effect present in the population being studied.\n\nNow, when the researchers modify the experiment to use twice as many experimental units for each treatment, it means they'll have more data points to analyze. This could lead to a more precise estimate of the effect size.\n\nThe four possible outcomes are:\n\n(A) The probability of a Type I error and the probability of a Type II error would both decrease.\n(B) The probability of a Type I error and the power would both increase.\n(C) The probability of a Type II error and the power would both increase.\n(D) The probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase.\n\nTo determine the outcome, we need to consider how the increased sample size affects the Type I and Type II errors and the power of the test.\n\n1. More data points could lead to a more accurate estimation of the effect size, which would decrease the variability in the data.\n2. A decreased variability usually leads to a decrease in the probability of a Type II error (false negative, not detecting an effect that's present) because it becomes easier to detect the effect.\n3. However, it could also lead to an increase in the probability of a Type I error (false positive, detecting an effect that's not present) if the increased sample size makes the effect appear stronger than it truly is.\n4. Power is the probability of detecting an effect when it's truly present. An increase in sample size generally leads to an increase in power because there's more data to analyze, making it more likely to detect a real effect.\n\nWith this reasoning in mind, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) The probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase.",
