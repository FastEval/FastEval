An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim.

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the null and alternative hypotheses.\nThe null hypothesis is that the true mean weight of the tablets is 300 milligrams. The alternative hypothesis is that the mean weight is not equal to 300 milligrams.\n\nStep 2: Choose a test statistic.\nWe will use the t-test as the hypothesis test because we have a simple random sample and there is no information provided about the population's variance.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic.\nFirst, we need to calculate the sample mean and sample standard deviation. Then, we can find the t-statistic using the formula:\n\nt = (sample mean - hypothesized mean) / (standard error \\* sqrt(n))\n\nStep 4: Identify the degrees of freedom (df).\nFor a simple random sample, the degrees of freedom equal the sample size minus one, which is 6 in this case.\n\nStep 5: Determine the critical value and p-value.\nSince the sample size is small (n <= 30), we'll use the t-distribution to find the critical value. We know the test statistic and the degrees of freedom, so we can look up the critical value in a t-distribution table. For a significance level of 0.05 and df = 6, the critical value is 1.54.\n\nThe p-value is the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one calculated in Step 3. If the calculated t-statistic is larger than the critical value (1.54), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nStep 6: Determine the answer.\nNow that we have the critical value and the t-statistic, we can find the p-value. The p-value is the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one calculated in Step 3.\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6",

Find the z-score for the mean waiting time, which is 35 minutes.\n2. Convert the z-score to a percentile, and find the corresponding waiting time.\n3. Convert 100,000 riders into a percentile.\n4. Subtract the percentile corresponding to the riders from the previous step to find the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders.\n\nNow, let's calculate:\n\n1. z = (mean - 35) / (10/sqrt(150000)) = (35 - 35) / (10/12.245) = 0\n2. Since z = 0, the percentile is 50, and the waiting time is 35 minutes.\n3. 100,000 riders corresponds to approximately 99.24% (Using a calculator, 1 - CDF(norm(), 35, 10/sqrt(150000)) = 0.992356)\n4. The shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is (35 - 99.24%) = 35 - 0.9924 = 0.0076 or 44.7 minutes.\n\nThe answer is (C) 25.3 to 44.7 minutes.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concepts of Type I and Type II errors, and the power of a test.\n\nType I error is the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis, and Type II error is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis.\n\nNow, when the researchers modify their experiment to use twice as many experimental units for each treatment, it affects the precision of the experiment. Increasing the sample size generally leads to a greater ability to detect true effects, which means the power of the test increases.\n\nSince the null hypothesis is, in fact, false, it's more likely that the modified experiment will detect the true effect, i.e., the probability of a Type II error decreases.\n\nTo determine the effect on Type I error, we need to consider the significance level, alpha (\u03b1). When the sample size is increased, the variability of the sample means decreases, and the estimates of the population means become more accurate. This could potentially make the test more conservative, increasing the Type I error rate. However, the effect of sample size increase on Type I error depends on the particulars of the situation, and it may not always increase.\n\nGiven this information, which statement is true?\n\n(A) The probability of a Type I error and the probability of a Type II error would both decrease.

This is correct because an increased sample size generally leads to a greater ability to detect true effects, increasing the power, and it is more likely to detect the true effect if the null hypothesis is false, reducing the probability of a Type II error.\n(D) The probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase. This is incorrect because the effect of sample size increase on Type I error is not guaranteed to be neutral, and the power is generally expected to increase with a larger sample size.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n(C) The probability of a Type II error and the power would both increase.",
