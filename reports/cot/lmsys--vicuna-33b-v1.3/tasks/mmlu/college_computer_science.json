No self-loops: This means that a node cannot be connected to itself. Therefore, the degree of each node (the number of edges connected to it) will be at most 1.\n2. At most one edge between any pair of nodes: This constraint implies that any two nodes can be connected by at most one edge. This means that if two nodes are connected, they cannot form a cycle of length 2 or more.\n\nNow, let's analyze how these constraints affect the number of connected components.\n\n1. Since no node can have a degree higher than 1, the graphs will be sparse. This suggests that the maximum number of connected components (M) could be achieved when the graph is disconnected, i.e., each node is a separate connected component.\n2. The minimum number of connected components (m) is hard to determine without considering specific graph structures, as it depends on the arrangement of nodes and edges. However, given the constraints, it is clear that m will be greater than 1 since no graph can have just one connected component.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) M = 10, m = 10: This option suggests that all graphs in the collection have 10 connected components. However, since there are only 6 edges in each graph, it is impossible to create a graph with 10 connected components. This option is incorrect.\n(B) M = 10, m = 1: This option suggests that all graphs have 10 connected components, with at least one graph having 1 connected component.
