This method has several limitations:\n\n1. (A) The matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage. While this may be a challenge, it is not the main difficulty.\n2. (C) Deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable. Although this issue arises with some access matrix implementations, it is not the primary limitation.\n3.

If there are multiple edges between a pair of nodes, we will consider them as a single edge when counting connected components.\n\nStep 3: Count the number of connected components in a graph with 10 nodes and 6 edges\n\nNow we will try to find M and m by counting the number of connected components in a graph with 10 nodes and 6 edges.

The edges are divided into two or more components.\n\nWe should find the maximum and minimum number of connected components that can be formed with the given constraints.\n\nStep 4: Maximum number of connected components (M)\n\nTo achieve M = 10, all edges must be connected in a single component. This can only happen if all nodes are connected to each other. Since there are no self-loops, each node must have an edge to 9 other nodes. However, there are only 6 edges in total, so it is impossible to have all nodes connected to each other. Therefore, M cannot be 10.\n\nStep 5: Minimum number of connected components (m)\n\nTo achieve m = 1, we need a graph with a single connected component.

We can achieve this by looking at how the edges can be divided.\n\nWe can divide the edges in two ways:\n\n1. Divide the edges into two connected components (5 nodes in each component).\n2. Divide the edges into three connected components (4 nodes in each component).\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of connected components can be 2 or 3.\n\nStep 7: Answer\n\nAfter analyzing all the possibilities, we find that M = 10 is not possible and M \u2264 3. Since M is the maximum number of connected components, it can take values 1, 2, or 3. Now, we need to find the minimum number of connected components (m) which can only be 1 if all edges are connected in a single component.\n\nThe answer is: M = 3, m = 1\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) M = 10, m = 1.",
