It established a loose confederation of sovereign states, with a weak central government. There were certain powers that were reserved for the states under the Articles of Confederation, which were not granted to the national government.\n\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, there were no provisions for:\n\n(A) Coining money: The Articles of Confederation did not give the national government the power to coin money or regulate currency.\n(B) Authorizing constitutional amendments: The Articles of Confederation could only be amended by unanimous consent of the states, making it very difficult to change.\n(C) Having representation in Congress: Under the Articles of Confederation, each state had one vote in Congress, regardless of population.\n(D) Appealing to the president to adjudicate disputes: The Articles of Confederation did not provide for a strong executive branch, let alone a process for the president to adjudicate disputes between states.\n\nAfter considering the options, we can determine that the power granted to the states by the Articles of Confederation but not by the Constitution is:\n\n(C) Having representation in Congress",

            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the context of federal judges in the United States. Federal judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, serving for life under the condition of good behavior.\n\nNow, let's analyze each of the given options:\n\n(A) Impeachment, conviction, and removal from office by Congress: Impeachment is a process used for removing high-ranking officials, including federal judges, from office for misconduct. In this case, the House of Representatives votes on impeachment, and the Senate holds a trial to determine if the official should be removed from office. This option is plausible for disciplinary actions.\n\n(B) Removal from office by the appointing president: While the President does appoint federal judges, they cannot remove them from office without cause. This process is in place to prevent abuse of power and maintain the independence of the judiciary. This option is not a disciplinary action for federal judges.\n\n(C) Removal from office by the president-elect: Similar to option B, the president-elect does not have the authority to remove federal judges from office without cause. This option is not a disciplinary action for federal judges.\n\n(D) Recall elections by citizens residing in the district over which the judge has jurisdiction: Federal judges are not subject to recall elections. Recall elections are typically used for elected officials at the state and local levels, but not for federal judges. This option is not a disciplinary action for federal judges.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Impeachment, conviction, and removal from office by Congress",
