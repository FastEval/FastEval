We are looking for a term that describes an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities, which has become a contested issue due to intensification of work and technological shifts.\n\n(A) Presenteeism: This term refers to the practice of attending work while sick, which could potentially spread illness to others. While it may be related to the work-life balance, it does not specifically describe a preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\n(B) Absenteeism: This term refers to the practice of missing work, which could also be related to work-life balance, but it does not describe an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\n(C) Work-play balance: This term is not widely recognized in the context of work-life balance. Additionally, it does not specifically focus on the ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\n(D) Work-life balance: This term refers to the equilibrium between an employee's work and personal life, which includes the proper ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities. Given the context of the question, it seems to be the most relevant and widely accepted term.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) Work-life balance",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Sure, let me outline my reasoning step-by-step before providing the answer:\n\n1. I will start by understanding the main focus of corporate profit maximization. It is a concept in neoclassical economics, and it suggests that firms should aim to maximize their profits to achieve economic efficiency.\n2. Next, I will examine the major normative theories, which are ethical theories that prescribe how individuals or organizations should act. These theories include hedonistic utilitarianism, preference utilitarianism, The Categorical Imperative, and ethics of care.\n3. My goal is to find the normative theory that is most similar to corporate profit maximization. To do this, I'll compare the main ethical principles of each theory to the concept of profit maximization.\n4. Hedonistic utilitarianism is an ethical theory that suggests actions that maximize overall happiness or pleasure are considered morally right. However, it doesn't directly prescribe profit maximization.\n5. Preference utilitarianism is similar to hedonistic utilitarianism in that it aims to maximize overall happiness or welfare. But, like hedonistic utilitarianism, it doesn't directly prescribe profit maximization.\n6. The Categorical Imperative is an ethical theory developed by Immanuel Kant, which focuses on moral duties and the singular principle that should govern moral action. This theory also does not directly prescribe profit maximization.\n7. Ethics of care is an ethical theory that emphasizes the importance of compassion, responsibility, and the need to care for others. It is also not directly linked to profit maximization.\n8. After evaluating each theory, none of them directly prescribe corporate profit maximization. However, preference utilitarianism and hedonistic utilitarianism are the most similar to corporate profit maximization because they both aim to maximize happiness or welfare, which can be indirectly related to profit maximization.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) preference utilitarianism",

The blank in the first position is asking for a word that describes a type of regulation that goes beyond what Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) typically have with businesses. From the options, we can eliminate (B) and (D) because they don't fit the context of the question.\n2. The blank in the second position asks for a word that describes the type of connection or interaction that CSOs have with businesses. Based on the options, we can narrow it down to (A) and (C).\n3. The blank in the third position is looking for a word that describes what the regulation concerns. From the options, we can narrow it down to (A) and (C).\n\nNow, we need to consider the context of the sentence. When CSOs have \"interactions\" with businesses, it's usually in the context of voluntary engagement or collaboration. This suggests that the regulation in question is likely to be more rigorous and mandatory in nature.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A):\n\nLegal, Interactions, Mechanics",
