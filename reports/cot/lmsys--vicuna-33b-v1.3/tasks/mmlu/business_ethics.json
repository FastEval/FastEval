            "question": "Typical advertising regulatory bodies suggest, for example that adverts must not: encourage _________, cause unnecessary ________ or _____, and must not cause _______ offence.\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze the question. It is asking for a single word that fits the blank by providing examples of what advertising regulatory bodies suggest adverts should not do. We can see that these examples are divided into three categories:\n\n1. Encourage unsafe practices\n2. Cause unnecessary (x, y)\n3. Cause (x) offence\n\nWe also have the options:\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious\n\nNow, let's work through the options.\n\nOption (A) starts with \"Unsafe practices,\" which fits the first category. However, the second category doesn't seem to fit since \"Wants\" and \"Fear\" don't seem to be related to causing unnecessary distress or anything else. The third category also doesn't fit, as \"Trivial\" doesn't seem to fit any of the examples given in the question. Option (A) doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption (B) starts with \"Unsafe practices,\" which fits the first category. The second category fits, as \"Distress\" and \"Fear\" could both cause unnecessary distress or fear. The third category also fits, as \"Serious\" offence is a type of offence that could be caused by an advert. Option (B) seems plausible.\n\nOption (C) starts with \"Safe practices,\" which doesn't fit the first category. The second category doesn't fit either, as \"Wants\" and \"Jealousy\" don't seem to be related to causing unnecessary distress or anything else. The third category also doesn't fit, as \"Trivial\" doesn't seem to fit any of the examples given in the question. Option (C) doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption (D) starts with \"Safe practices,\" which doesn't fit the first category. The second category also doesn't fit, as \"Distress\" and \"Jealousy\" don't seem to be related to causing unnecessary distress or anything else. The third category fits, as \"Serious\" offence is a type of offence that could be caused by an advert. However, the first category doesn't fit, which makes option (D) incorrect.\n\nAfter going through the options, it seems that Option (B) is the most plausible answer.\n\nAnswer: (B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the similarities and differences between the given normative theories: hedonistic utilitarianism, preference utilitarianism, the Categorical Imperative, and the ethics of care.\n\n1. Hedonistic Utilitarianism: This theory, attributed to Jeremy Bentham, holds that an action is morally right if it maximizes overall pleasure or happiness, and wrong if it maximizes pain or unhappiness. This theory suggests that corporate profit maximization could be morally right if it leads to the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people, assuming that profit maximization contributes to overall well-being.\n2. Preference Utilitarianism: This theory, attributed to John Stuart Mill, is similar to hedonistic utilitarianism, but it focuses on the satisfaction of individual preferences rather than overall happiness. An action is morally right if it satisfies the preferences of the majority. In this case, corporate profit maximization could be justified if it satisfies the preferences of stakeholders, such as shareholders, employees, and customers.\n3. The Categorical Imperative: This is an ethical theory introduced by Immanuel Kant, which focuses on the moral worth of an action itself, rather than its consequences. Kantian ethics emphasizes duty, autonomy, and respect for persons. Corporate profit maximization would not be directly prescribed by Kant's ethics, as it doesn't fit into his categorical imperative framework.\n4. Ethics of Care: This theory, attributed to feminist philosophers like Carol Gilligan, emphasizes the importance of relationships, responsibilities, and the virtues of care and compassion. It is more concerned with the fair distribution of resources and care for the vulnerable, rather than simply maximizing profit. Therefore, it is less similar to corporate profit maximization.\n\nAfter considering these theories, I believe that:\n\n(B) preference utilitarianism",

He believed that the primary goal of business should be to maximize profit within the rules of the game, which refers to the legal and moral framework set by society.\n\n(A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders\nThis option closely aligns with Friedman's views, as he believed that the primary responsibility of business is to maximize shareholder value. However, it is not his exact quote.\n\n(B) Managers should act in ways that balance the interest of society and shareholders\nThis option does not align with Friedman's views, as he argued that managers should focus on profit maximization and not act as social engineers.\n\n(C) The primary responsibility organizations have is to its employees\nFriedman's views focused on the responsibility to shareholders, not employees. This option does not represent his beliefs.\n\n(D) The primary responsibility organizations have is to its stakeholders\nThis option refers to a more modern, broader perspective on business responsibilities, which is not necessarily what Friedman advocated for.\n\nAfter analyzing the options, I believe the best fit for Milton Friedman's belief regarding the sole responsibility of business is:\n\n(A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders.",
