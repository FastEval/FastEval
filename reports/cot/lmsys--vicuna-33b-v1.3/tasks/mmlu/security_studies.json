            "model_answer": "First, let's clarify the question: We are asked to determine which of the given principles is not an element of the responsibility to protect (R2P). The responsibility to protect is a United Nations framework that focuses on the protection of civilians from genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing.\n\nNext, I will explain my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Recognize that the responsibility to protect (R2P) has three main components: prevention, reaction, and rebuilding (these are also known as the \"three R's\").\n2. Understand that the responsibility to prevent refers to the duty of states and the international community to prevent the aforementioned crimes before they occur.\n3. Realize that the responsibility to react refers to the duty to respond to the aforementioned crimes if they have already occurred.\n4. Recognize that the responsibility to rebuild refers to the duty to assist in rebuilding and recovery efforts after the aforementioned crimes.\n5. Notice that there is no mention of a \"responsibility to remain sovereign\" in the context of the responsibility to protect. Therefore, (C) the responsibility to remain sovereign is not an element of the responsibility to protect.\n\nThe answer is (C).",

            "question": "Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\n\n(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",

            "model_answer": "First, I will provide the reasoning for each of the options:\n\n(A) This option suggests that environmental challenges can actually lead to innovation and technological advancements that can bolster military programs. While it is true that adversity can sometimes lead to innovation, it does not necessarily guarantee that environmental challenges will always be reconciled with national security interests.\n\n(B) This option focuses on the potential negative impact of environmental changes on the economic base of a nation, which in turn could weaken military capacity. It also acknowledges that human factors will shape the outcome of these developments. This option seems to provide a more balanced analysis of the relationship between environmental changes and national security interests.\n\n(C) This option argues that environmental problems are mainly internal, while external threats remain within a country's control. This suggests that environmental changes are less relevant to national security interests, as long as the country can maintain control over external military threats. However, this view ignores the potential global implications of environmental changes.\n\n(D) This option claims that all of the above options are true. It acknowledges that environmental challenges can lead to innovation, the economic base of a nation can be affected, and that external military threats remain a primary concern. This option captures the complexity and multifaceted nature of the relationship between environmental changes and national security interests.\n\nAfter considering the reasoning for each option, I believe the correct answer is:\n\n(D) All of these options.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

The statement refers to energy scarcity, which aligns with a potential liberal perspective on future energy security.\n2. It implies that the global system could experience disruptions due to energy scarcity.\n3. The statement suggests the emergence of a \"new international energy order,\" which implies a change from the current system.\n4. The new order is described as being less focused on liberal free-market trading, indicating a departure from a liberal perspective.\n5. The phrase \"statism and neo-mercantilism\" suggests a more government-oriented and protectionist approach to energy, contrasting with a liberal perspective that favors free-market principles.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated.\n(D) Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated.
