Now, let's go through each option:\n\n(A) The formation of the non-aligned movement:\nThis option seems to align with the clue. The Non-Aligned Movement was an organization of countries that sought to maintain independence from the influence of the major powers during the Cold War. It was comprised of many Asian and African countries, which is consistent with the passage.\n\n(B) Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation:\nThis option does not align with the clue, as it focuses on reducing or eliminating weapons, not on the unity of Asian and African countries.\n\n(C) The Green Revolution in agriculture:\nThis option does not align with the clue, as it refers to a series of research, development, and technology transfer initiatives designed to increase agricultural production in developing countries, which is not related to the unity of Asian and African countries.\n\n(D) Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology:\nThis option does not align with the clue, as pan-Asian ideology is focused on promoting a sense of Asian identity and unity, rather than specifically focusing on the strength of Asian and African countries in the pursuit of peace.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) The formation of the non-aligned movement",

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

Europe focused on developing more powerful and easy-to-move gunpowder weapons for use in sieges, while China focused on improving horse archer units to combat steppe nomads.\n4.

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away.

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.
