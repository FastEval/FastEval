By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

The passage discusses the development and use of gunpowder weapons in both Europe and China.\n2. It highlights that European governments invested in gunpowder weapons, leading to more powerful and easier-to-move weapons.\n3. It contrasts this with China's focus on improving horse archer units to combat steppe nomads, which were a more pressing threat.\n4. This contrast in focus and investment suggests that European states may have developed military superiority over non-Western powers, such as China, in the modern era.",

He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out.

The conflicts mentioned are the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Korean War, the Cold War, and the Vietnam conflicts.\n4.

The keynote address to the Bandung Conference was in 1955, so we should look for a conflict that was occurring around that time.\n6. The Korean War occurred from 1950 to 1953, which is before the 1955 Bandung Conference. It is unlikely that Sukarno was trying to maintain a neutral stance in this conflict.\n7. The Arab-Israeli conflict refers to the ongoing conflict between Arab countries and Israel. Since Sukarno was an Indonesian leader, it is more likely that he would try to maintain a neutral stance in a conflict that did not directly involve his country.\n8. The Cold War involved the United States, the Soviet Union, and their respective allies. While the conflict occurred between 1947 and 1991, it is not specific to a particular region and is a broader geopolitical struggle.\n9.

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence.
