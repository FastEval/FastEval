            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand the basic anatomy and how light enters the eye.\n\n1. The cornea: This is the transparent layer at the front of the eye that helps focus light on the retina.\n2. The lens: Behind the cornea, the lens is responsible for adjusting the focusing power of the eye.\n3. The iris: This is the colored part of the eye that regulates the amount of light entering the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil.\n4. The retina: This is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that converts light into electrical signals for the brain to interpret as images.\n\nNow, we need to identify what causes nearsightedness, also known as myopia.\n\n1. Nearsightedness occurs when parallel light rays from distant objects are focused in front of the retina, rather than directly on it. This causes blurry vision for distant objects.\n2. To focus light on the retina, both the cornea and the lens play a role in refracting (bending) light.\n\nBased on this information, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) Too much curvature of the cornea and lens: If the cornea and lens have too much curvature, they will bend light too much, focusing it in front of the retina, causing nearsightedness.\n(B) Too little curvature of the cornea and lens: If the cornea and lens have too little curvature, they won't bend light enough, causing distant objects to be focused behind the retina, which is hyperopia (farsightedness), not nearsightedness.\n(C) Too much curvature of the iris and lens: This option doesn't make sense, as the iris doesn't play a direct role in focusing light.\n(D) Too little curvature of the iris and lens: This option doesn't make sense either, as the iris doesn't directly affect focusing.\n\nSo, after evaluating the options, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) too much curvature of the cornea and lens",

            "model_answer": "First, let's understand the question. It asks which condition delusions of grandeur are most characteristic of. Delusions of grandeur are a type of delusion where a person believes they have special powers or abilities, or are of high social status.\n\nNext, we need to consider each of the conditions given:\n\n(A) OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) - OCD is characterized by repetitive thoughts and behaviors. Delusions of grandeur are not typically associated with OCD.\n\n(B) schizophrenia - Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder, and it is possible for people with schizophrenia to experience delusions of grandeur, but it's not exclusive to schizophrenia.\n\n(C) conversion disorder - Conversion disorder, also known as functional neurological symptom disorder, is a condition where a person experiences physical symptoms without a clear medical cause. Delusions of grandeur are not associated with conversion disorder.\n\n(D) antisocial personality disorder - Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a lack of empathy and disregard for the feelings of others. It is not directly linked to delusions of grandeur.\n\nAfter considering each option, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) schizophrenia",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs and its relevance to the given options.\n\nMaslow proposed that humans have different types of needs, and these needs can be organized into a hierarchy ranging from basic to more complex needs. The most basic needs are physiological needs, followed by safety, belonging, esteem, and self-actualization needs.\n\nNow let's analyze each of the options in relation to Maslow's hierarchy of needs:\n\n(A) Homeostatic regulation: This option relates to the maintaining of a stable internal environment, such as maintaining a constant body temperature. While it is essential for survival, it does not directly correspond to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.\n\n(B) Goal-setting: This option involves setting specific, achievable goals to motivate oneself. While it relates to motivation, it does not specifically relate to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.\n\n(C) Expectancy-value: This option refers to the belief that an individual holds regarding their ability to perform a task and the value they place on completing it. This also relates to motivation, but it does not directly connect to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.\n\n(D) Hierarchy of needs: This option accurately represents Maslow's proposal that some motives are more imperative to survival than others. Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theory that categorizes human needs into different levels, with the most basic needs being essential for survival.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Hierarchy of needs",
