            "model_answer": "(A) includes two or more alternatives\nA disjunctive syllogism is a form of argument that reasons from two or more alternative statements. The major premise of a valid disjunctive syllogism must include these alternatives.\n\n(B) classifies subjects\nA disjunctive syllogism does not necessarily classify subjects. Instead, it deals with alternative statements.\n\n(C) affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent\nA disjunctive syllogism involves a relationships between two propositions, and it may affirm or deny one proposition based on the other. However, it does not necessarily affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent.\n\n(D) leads to a valid conclusion\nA major premise in a disjunctive syllogism must provide a relationship between the two propositions that, when considered together, lead to a valid conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D). A valid disjunctive syllogism has a major premise that leads to a valid conclusion.",

The fallacy of double negative focuses on two negative statements that are used to form a positive statement, which can be misleading or illogical.\n4.
