            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we can first analyze each option and determine which one best fits the description of a valid disjunctive syllogism.\n\n(A) includes two or more alternatives: This option doesn't directly relate to the structure or formation of a valid disjunctive syllogism but rather describes a general characteristic of the statements within the syllogism.\n\n(B) classifies subjects: This option doesn't describe the structure or formation of a valid disjunctive syllogism. It might refer to a different type of syllogism or a different aspect of logic.\n\n(C) affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent: This option seems to be closer to the description of a valid disjunctive syllogism. In a disjunctive syllogism, the major premise contains two or more alternatives, and the conclusion denies one of them. This option mentions affirming the antecedent or denying the consequent, which fits the structure of a disjunctive syllogism.\n\n(D) leads to a valid conclusion: This option is also close to the description of a valid disjunctive syllogism. In a disjunctive syllogism, the major premise and the minor premise together lead to a valid conclusion.\n\nAfter analyzing the options, (C) seems to be the most accurate description of a valid disjunctive syllogism's major premise.\n\nAnswer: (C)",
