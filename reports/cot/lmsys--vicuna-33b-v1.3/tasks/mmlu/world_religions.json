            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we first need to understand the context and meaning of the term \"murtis.\" It appears to be related to Hinduism, as the question mentions idols, which are commonly found in Hindu worship.\n\nMurtis are idols or images used in Hindu worship.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Let's break down the question to identify what we are looking for. The question is asking about a group of naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes. We need to find the school of thought that is most closely associated with this focus.\n\nFirst, we should identify the time period and the region that the question is referring to. It appears that the question is asking about Chinese philosophy, as the options provided all refer to Chinese philosophical schools.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\n(A) Daoism: This school of thought is also known as Taoism, and it is an ancient Chinese philosophy that emphasizes living in harmony with the Dao (or Tao), which is a natural, spontaneous, eternal and indescribable way. Daoism does focus on natural elements and processes, so it could be a possible answer.\n\n(B) Yin-Yang School: This school is also known as the Yin-Yang Conflict School or the Yin-Yang Balance School, and it is a dualistic philosophy that sees everything in the world as a result of the interaction between complementary opposites, such as yin and yang. While the Yin-Yang School does consider natural elements, it might not focus on them as much as option (A).\n\n(C) Mengzi: Mengzi (also known as Mencius) was an ancient Chinese philosopher who was a follower of Confucius and developed Confucianist thought. He emphasized the goodness of human nature and the importance of individual moral cultivation. Mengzi's teachings do not seem to focus on natural elements and processes, so we can rule this option out.\n\n(D) Humanistic Buddhism: Humanistic Buddhism is a modern form of Buddhism that emphasizes human experience, human potential, and human happiness. Although Buddhism does have a focus on nature and the environment, Humanistic Buddhism is a modern development and might not be directly associated with the natural elements and processes mentioned in the question.\n\nBased on our analysis, the school of thought most closely associated with natural elements and processes is:\n\n(A) Daoism",
