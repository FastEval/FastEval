            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the term \"murtis\". It seems to be related to Hinduism, as the options provided ('offerings', 'prayers', 'apparitions', and 'idols') are common aspects of Hindu worship. Let's examine each option.\n\n(A) Offerings: Murtis might be related to offerings, but this doesn't seem to be the primary meaning. Hindu offerings are typically made during pujas (rituals) to express gratitude or seek blessings.\n\n(B) Prayers: Murtis could refer to prayers, but again, this seems to be a secondary meaning. Prayers are a form of communication with the divine, and they play a significant role in Hindu worship.\n\n(C) Apparitions: Murtis might be appearances or manifestations of the divine, but this option isn't the right fit either. Apparitions usually refer to unexpected or unexplainable sightings or visions.\n\n(D) Idols: After considering the other options, it seems that 'murtis' can be translated as 'idols'. In Hinduism, idols represent the divine and are used as focal points during worship. They are not the divine themselves, but rather symbols that help practitioners connect with the divine.\n\nAnswer: (D) Idols",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "It is important to first understand the context of the question. It seems to be asking about the philosophical or religious schools of thought associated with naturalists who focus on natural elements and processes. I will need to analyze each option in terms of this context.\n\nA. Daoism: Daoism, also known as Taoism, is an ancient Chinese philosophy that emphasizes living in harmony with the Dao (or Tao), which can be loosely translated as \"the way\" or \"nature.\" Daoism does focus on natural elements and processes, so it is a possible correct answer.\n\nB. Yin-Yang School: Yin-Yang School is a term that might refer to the ancient Chinese philosophy that emphasizes balance and harmony between opposing forces, such as light and dark (yin) and bright and sunny (yang). While this philosophy does incorporate natural elements, it might not specifically emphasize natural processes as much as Daoism does, so it might not be the best answer.\n\nC. Mengzi: Mengzi (also known as Menicus or Mencius) was an ancient Chinese philosopher who was a Confucian scholar and developer of Confucianism. Confucianism is more focused on ethical and moral development of individuals and societies than on natural elements and processes, so it is probably not the best answer.\n\nD. Humanistic Buddhism: Humanistic Buddhism is a modern Buddhist movement that emphasizes the importance of human experience and human potential for enlightenment, rather than focusing on supernatural elements. While this movement might incorporate some natural elements in its teachings, it does not seem to concentrate specifically on natural elements and processes, so it is probably not the best answer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is likely to be:\n\n(A) Daoism",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to identify the year in which the first Buddhist temple was constructed in Japan. We don't have direct information on this, but we can use historical context to make an informed guess.\n\n1. Consider the timeline of Buddhism's spread:\n\t* Buddhism originated in India around the 5th century BCE.\n\t* It spread to China around the 1st century CE.\n\t* From China, it spread to Korea and then Japan.\n2. Japan's first Buddhist temple:\n\t* The oldest Buddhist temple in Japan is thought to be the Horyu-ji temple, which was completed in the early 7th century CE.\n\t* However, it is possible that smaller Buddhist temples or structures were built before the Horyu-ji temple. We need to consider a date that would allow for the spread of Buddhism from China to Japan and the time needed to build a temple.\n3. Option (C) 451 CE seems reasonable:\n\t* This option is closest to the time when Buddhism is believed to have reached Korea (approximately 372 CE) and the estimated time it might have taken for Buddhism to spread to Japan.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is (C) 451 CE.",
