If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.",

Option (A) states that the duke is sympathetic to the king. This cannot be the best explanation, as the memoir does not portray the king in an entirely positive light.\n\nOption (B) suggests that the duke is biased against the king due to the suppression of the nobility.

Upon closer examination, this option appears to be the best explanation for the bias in the document. The memoir mentions the king's treatment of courtiers and his tendencies in bestowing favors, which aligns with the idea that he preserved their social position and legal privileges.

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\n(A) De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n(C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n(D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.",

Christopher Columbus's account describes his intentions as benevolent, mentioning that he gave the natives \"beautiful and acceptable articles\" without asking for anything in return. When he mentions that he \"forbad\" the natives trading their valuables for trifles, it implies that he tried to protect them from being taken advantage of.\n2. Bartholomew de las Casas's account, on the other hand, is highly critical of the Spanish treatment of the natives. He describes the Spanish as \"ravaging wolves\" who \"tear the natives to shreds, murder them, and inflict untold misery, suffering, and distress.\" He also states that the Spanish killed an immense number of natives to obtain gold and wealth.\n3. The two accounts differ significantly in their portrayal of the Spanish and their interactions with the natives. Columbus's account presents a more positive image, while de las Casas's account is highly negative.\n4. The most plausible explanation for these differences is that de las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas. As a Bishop, he was likely to be more concerned with the ethical treatment of the natives, which would lead him to emphasize the negative aspects of the Spanish conquest and colonization.\n5. Option (A) can be ruled out because there is no evidence that de las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery. Option (B) can be discounted because while Columbus might have been biased in his favor, it does not fully explain the stark contrast between the two accounts. Option (C) can be rejected because there is no evidence to suggest that Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than other Spanish expeditions.
