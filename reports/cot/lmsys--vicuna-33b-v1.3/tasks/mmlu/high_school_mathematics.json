He makes a random choice at each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) with equal probabilities.\n3. We want to find the probability that he eats at least two different kinds of fruit on a given day.\n\nNow, let's compute the probability of eating exactly two different kinds of fruit in one day. We have three possibilities for the first meal:\n\n* Apple: Remaining options are orange and banana.\n* Orange: Remaining options are apple and banana.\n* Banana: Remaining options are apple and orange.\n\nAfter the first meal, there are two options left. For the second meal, he has a 1/2 chance of choosing a different fruit. So the probability of eating exactly two different kinds of fruit in one day is 3 \\* 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nFinally, let's find the probability of eating at least two different kinds of fruit. We can do this by adding the probabilities of eating exactly two different kinds of fruit and eating all three different kinds of fruit:\n\nP(at least two different kinds) = P(exactly two different kinds) + P(all three different kinds) = (3/2) + (1/2) = 7/2.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of eating only one kind of fruit, which is the complementary event:\n\nP(eating one kind of fruit) = 1 - P(at least two different kinds) = 1 - 7/2 = 5/2.\n\nFinally, we want the probability as a fraction of 1:\n\nP(at least two different kinds) / P(eating one kind of fruit) = 7/2 / 5/2 = 7/5.\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options.

Since there are two piles, we need to multiply one-third by 2, which is one-sixth. So, John gave his brother one-sixth of one pile.\n\nIn order to find the fraction of hat pins John gave to his brother, we can use the following equation:\n\nFraction of hat pins given = (1/6) \\* (y / 2)\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of hat pins John has left, which is the initial number of hat pins minus the number of hat pins given to his brother.\n\nTotal hat pins left = x - (1/6) \\* (y / 2)\n\nAccording to the question, John had 66 pins left. We can now set up the following equation:\n\n66 = x - (1/6) \\* (y / 2)\n\nFirst, we can simplify the right side of the equation by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of (1/6) by 2:\n\n66 = x - (1/3) \\* y\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of y back into the equation:\n\n66 = x - (1/3) \\* (x / 2)\n\n66 = (2/3) \\* x - (1/3) \\* x\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by adding (1/3) \\* x to both sides:\n\n3/3 \\* x = 92\n\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 3/3 to get the value of x:\n\nx = 92 / 3\n\nx = 30.6666\n\nSince the total number of hat pins cannot have a decimal, we need to round it off to the nearest whole number.
