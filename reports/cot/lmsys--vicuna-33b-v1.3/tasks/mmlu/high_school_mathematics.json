            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Since f(x) is strictly convex, the graph of y=f(x) between any two points will be below the line segment connecting those points on the y-axis.\n2. Given that f(x) passes through (-2, 5) and (2, 9), we can use this property to create a line segment that bounds the graph of y=f(x) between x=-2 and x=2.\n3. The line segment connecting (-2, 5) and (2, 9) is a degree 2 polynomials, which can be written as y = a(x + 2) + 5, where 'a' is a constant. We need to find the range of possible values for 'a' such that this line segment stays below the graph of y=f(x) between x=-2 and x=2.\n4. To find the range of possible values for 'a', we can first find the equation of the graph of y=f(x) for x between -2 and 2. Since we don't know f(x), we can't find an exact equation. Instead, we can use the fact that f(x) is continuous and differentiable in this interval, so its graph will be a smooth curve.\n5. Since the graph of y=f(x) is below the line segment connecting (-2, 5) and (2, 9), the curve must be concave down. This suggests that f'(x) < 0 in the interval (-2, 2).\n6. Now we can express the range of possible values for 'a'. Since f'(x) < 0 and f(x) is continuous, there must be a minimum point in the interval (-2, 2). Let's denote this minimum point as (c, f(c)). So, we have f(x) < a(x + 2) + 5 for x in the interval (-2, 2). The range of 'a' should now include values such that a \\* (c + 2) + 5 is less than or equal to f(c).\n7. Given the information, we can't find the exact value of c, so we can't determine a precise range for 'a'. However, we can reason that the range will be a subset of the range of f(1) values.\n8. Thus, the range of possible values for f(1) in interval notation will be (-inf, 9], because f(1) should be less than or equal to 9, which is the y-value of the line segment at x=2. Since we cannot determine the exact range of 'a' values, we cannot include the lower bound (i.e., -inf) as part of the interval notation.\n\nAnswer: (D) (-inf, 7)",

We can express 240 as the sum of consecutive odd integers by first finding the difference between two consecutive odd integers.\n2. Since we are summing odd integers, we will have to use an even number of them. So, we will need to find two integers that add up to 240 when their difference is added to itself even number of times.\n3. We know that the differences between consecutive odd integers are always even (e.g., 1 - 3 = 2, 3 - 5 = 2, and so on). The first difference that gives us a sum close to 240 is 5 - 3 = 2.
