            "model_answer": "Alright, let's reason through the problem step-by-step.\n\nFirst, we have the equation 24 = 2p.\n\n1. We need to isolate the variable 'p' on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2.\n2. Dividing by 2, we have (24 \u00f7 2) = (2p \u00f7 2).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.\n\n1. (24 \u00f7 2) = 12.\n\nNow we have the equation 12 = 2p.\n\n1. We need to isolate the variable 'p' again. This time, we will multiply both sides of the equation by 1/2.\n2. Multiplying by 1/2, we have (12 \u00d7 1/2) = (2p \u00d7 1/2).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.\n\n1. (12 \u00d7 1/2) = 6.\n\nNow we have the equation 6 = 2p.\n\n1. To find the value of 'p', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2.\n2. Dividing by 2, we have (6 \u00f7 2) = (2p \u00f7 2).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.\n\n1.

We know she drove the same number of miles each day, so we can multiply the daily distance by 5.\n2. Since she drove 40 miles in 5 days, the total distance is 40 miles. We can use this information to find the distance driven per day.\n3. We can set up an equation to solve for the number of miles driven each day:\n\n40 (total miles) / 5 (days) = daily distance\n40 \u00f7 5 = 8\n\nMs. Perez drove 8 miles each day.\n\n(C) 8",
