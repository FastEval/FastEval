            "model_answer": "To find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, I need to determine the minimum number of elements from the larger field that can be written as a linear combination of the generators of the extension.\n\nFirst, we need to express sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) in terms of the generator sqrt(18). We can do this by finding the minimum polynomial for both of them over Q.\n\nLet m(x) be the minimum polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q and n(x) be the minimum polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q. Since both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are irrational, their minimum polynomials are of degree 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest degree of the polynomial that makes both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) as its roots. This can be achieved by using the resultant of the two polynomials.\n\nLet d(x) be the resultant of m(x) and n(x). Then d(x) is of degree 2 in x, and its coefficients are integers. It's the smallest polynomial that makes both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) as its roots.\n\nSince d(x) is of degree 2, its roots are the reciprocals of the roots of the original polynomial, which are sqrt(2) and sqrt(3). Therefore, we can express sqrt(18) in terms of these roots as follows:\n\nsqrt(18) = c1 \\* sqrt(2) + c2 \\* sqrt(3)\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients c1 and c2. We can do this by substituting sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) in terms of sqrt(18) from the previous step into the equation above:\n\nsqrt(18) = (c1 \\* d(sqrt(18))) / (sqrt(2) \\* sqrt(3)) + (c2 \\* d(sqrt(18))) / (sqrt(2) \\* sqrt(3))\n\nBy comparing the coefficients, we can find the value of c1 and c2. Since we are only interested in the maximum degree of the generator, we can ignore the negative sign and keep the positive one. In this case, it's -c2/c1.\n\nFinally, we need to determine the minimum degree of the generator. Since the expressionsqrt(18) = (c1 \\* sqrt(2) + c2 \\* sqrt(3)) doesn't involve any complex numbers, the degree of the generator is at most 2.\n\nSo, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is 2.\n\nThe answer is (C) 2.",

            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's understand the meaning of \"order\" in the context of group theory. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that the element raised to the power of n gives the identity element.\n2. The statement \"If a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15\" can be broken down into two parts:\na. There exists an element of order 15 in the group.\nb. There are at least 8 elements of order 15 in the group.\n3. Let's prove the first part. Since an element has order 15, its powers are {e, a^15, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9, a^11, a^12, a^13, a^14}. To prove part (a), we need to show that each of these powers is distinct. This is true because 15 is prime, and thus a^i is not equal to a^j if i and j are not equal (mod 15).\n4. Now let's prove the second part, which states there are at least 8 elements of order 15. Since each of the powers of the element of order 15 is distinct, the Cayley table will have 15 distinct elements, including the identity and the element of order 15 itself. Thus, there are at least 15 - 2 = 13 elements of order 15.\n5. The second statement is: \"If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\" To prove this, we need to show that there can't be more than 8 elements of order 15 in a group.\n6. Since the group has an element of order 15, there must be 15 distinct powers of this element, including the identity. This means there are 15 - 1 = 14 additional elements, excluding the identity and the element of order 15 itself. Together with the identity and the element of order 15, there are 15 + 1 + 14 = 28 - 14 = 14 elements in the group.\n7. Since there are only 14 elements in the group and we have already counted 8 elements of order 15 (including the identity and the element of order 15), there can't be more than 8 elements of order 15 in the group.\n8.

We know that a homomorphism must preserve the group structure.

Thus, the image group must be isomorphic to a factor group of G.\n\nStatement 2: The homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G.

In other words, if f(x) = f(y), then x = y.

This implies that each element in the domain is mapped to a distinct element in the codomain, so the homomorphism is one-to-one.\n\nStatement 2: Q is an ideal in R.\n\nThe set Q of rational numbers is a subring of the set R of real numbers.
