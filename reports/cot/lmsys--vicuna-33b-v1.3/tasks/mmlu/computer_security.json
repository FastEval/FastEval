            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine which style of fuzzer is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the program, we will analyze each fuzzer type:\n\n(A) Generational:\nGenerational fuzzers start with one or more seed inputs and create new inputs by applying mutations or other transformations. The new inputs are either valid or invalid. If they are valid, they replace the previous seed inputs and the process continues. This process can miss some invalid inputs that are not reachable from the initial seeds.\n\n(B) Blackbox:\nBlackbox fuzzers work at the binary level, without any knowledge of the program's internal structure or source code. They generate random inputs and send them to the target program. They check for crashers (invalid inputs that cause the program to crash or produce unexpected outputs) and improve the next input based on the results. Blackbox fuzzers might not explore every line of code if they do not generate inputs that cover certain branches or paths.\n\n(C) Whitebox:\nWhitebox fuzzers have knowledge of the program's internal structure or source code. They use techniques like symbolic execution or control-flow modeling to generate inputs that explore different paths in the code. They are more likely to cover every line of code since they are specifically designed to explore the program's control flow.\n\n(D) Mutation-based:\nMutation-based fuzzers work by creating new inputs from existing ones through mutations, which might include flipping bits, swapping bytes, or modifying specific sections of the input. They do not have the same level of code coverage guarantee as whitebox fuzzers, as they rely on random mutations that might not explore all possible paths.\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer is:\n\n(C) Whitebox",

Since a Diffie-Hellman exchange was executed, that means the client and server generated shared secret keys, which they can use to encrypt and decrypt transmitted data.\n3. The server certificate was checked by the client, which ensures the client is connected to the legitimate server and not an impostor.\n4. The client did not provide a client certificate, so the server cannot verify the client's identity.\n\nGiven the information:\n\n* The server is legitimate, and the client verified the server's identity.\n* The connection is secure because of the shared secret keys.\n\nNow let's consider the attacks:\n\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier. TLS does not provide perfect protection against this. However, it does include a sequence number in each record to prevent attacks like this. Since the attacker cannot decrypt the data, they would have a hard time injecting data, so this protection is relatively effective. Therefore, this attack is mitigated, but not completely prevented.\n2. An attacker impersonating the server. TLS provides perfect protection against this attack, because the client has verified the server's identity using the server certificate. The client and server also share a secure connection based on the shared secret keys, which prevents eavesdropping or tampering.\n\nBased on the reasoning, the answer is:\n\n(D) False, True",

What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",

However, this is not the primary mechanism to ensure that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used. Kerberos tickets are validated between the client and the server, not solely by the KDC.\n\n(B) This option refers to a 24-hour timer on the server side to terminate connections. While it might be a security measure to prevent long-lived connections, it does not directly address the validation of expired tickets.\n\n(C) This option is close to the correct answer. When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket's expiration time with its own clock. If the ticket has expired, the server will not authenticate the user. However, this statement does not mention the KDC's role in the validation process, which is essential for ensuring that an expired ticket cannot be used.\n\n(D) This option is the correct one. When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC's clock. If the ticket is expired, the KDC will report it, and the server will refuse to authenticate the user. This ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket cannot be used.\n\nThe answer is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Let's break down the question and analyze it step-by-step:\n\n1. Understand the context: Buffer overflow is a security vulnerability that occurs when a program tries to write more data to a buffer than it can handle. The extra data overflows into adjacent memory areas, potentially overwriting other variables or executable code.\n2. Identify the languages: The question mentions that apps developed in languages like C and C++ are prone to buffer-overflow vulnerabilities. These are low-level programming languages that provide direct access to system resources and memory.\n3. Analyze the reasons: To answer this question, we need to identify why programs in C and C++ are more susceptible to buffer-overflow vulnerabilities compared to other languages. We can consider the following reasons:\n\na. No string boundary checks in predefined functions: C and C++ standard library functions often do not check string boundaries by default, which can lead to buffer overflows if not handled properly by the programmer.\nb. No storage check in the external memory: In C and C++, memory allocation and deallocation are left to the programmer, who needs to ensure proper memory bounds. Failure to do so can lead to buffer overflows.\nc. No processing power check: This reason does not directly relate to buffer overflows, as processing power does not affect memory allocation or buffer handling.\nd. No database check: This reason also doesn't directly relate to buffer overflows, as database checks would involve different aspects of a program, such as input validation and data storage.\n4. Choose the best answer: After analyzing the reasons, we can conclude that the correct answer is:\n\n(B) No storage check in the external memory\n\nThis answer choice best captures the essence of why C and C++ programs are prone to buffer-overflow vulnerabilities, as the responsibility of allocating and deallocating memory lies with the programmer, and improper handling of memory boundaries can lead to buffer overflows.",
