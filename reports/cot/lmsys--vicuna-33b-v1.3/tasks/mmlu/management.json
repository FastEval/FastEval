It is a combination of the words \"satisfy\" and \"suffice,\" indicating that the outcome meets the minimum requirements but may not be optimal.\n\nStep 5: Output the answer\nThe term for a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome of negotiations between parties is:\n\n(B) Satisficing",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Let's break down the question step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the type of bias: We need to determine which type of bias the question is referring to. It mentions a \"rule of thumb\" in decision-making, which could be related to cognitive biases.\n2. Understand the rule of thumb: A \"rule of thumb\" typically refers to a simplified method or approach used in decision-making, often relying on intuition or experience.\n3. Connect the bias to decision-making: The bias should be related to how people make decisions or judgments, which may be influenced by cognitive factors.\n4. Review the options: Since the rule of thumb is a simplified approach, options (B) Hindsight bias and (C) Over-confidence bias can be ruled out as they do not directly relate to decision-making approaches.\n5. Analyze the remaining option: This leaves us with (D) Heuristics. A heuristic is a mental shortcut that aids in decision-making. While not always simplistic, they can often be referred to as \"rules of thumb\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) Heuristics",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I can explain my reasoning step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's define \"perspective\". In the context of this question, a perspective can be understood as a particular way of looking at or understanding something, based on a set of beliefs, values, or assumptions.\n\nNext, let's define \"normative\". In this context, \"normative\" refers to standards, rules, or expectations that prescribe how something should be done, or how people should behave.\n\nNow, considering these definitions, we can infer that a \"normative perspective\" refers to a way of understanding or judging something based on a set of standards or rules that prescribe how things should be.\n\nBased on this understanding, I would conclude that the correct answer is:\n\n(C) The way things should be.",

The power of suppliers\n5. The level of rivalry\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these factors represents competitive activity between organizations. We can eliminate the first four factors since they do not directly involve competition between organizations.\n\nThat leaves us with the fifth factor:\n\n(D) The level of rivalry\n\nThis factor focuses on the competition between existing organizations in an industry.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine which political leader cannot be termed a 'transformational' leader, we need to define the characteristics of a transformational leader. Transformational leaders typically possess the following qualities:\n\n1. Charisma: They have a powerful presence that inspires confidence and trust in their followers.\n2. Vision: They have a clear and compelling vision for change or progress.\n3. Intellectual stimulation: They challenge the status quo, encouraging innovation and critical thinking.\n4. Individualized consideration: They care about the needs and concerns of their followers and show genuine interest in their well-being.\n5. Moral and ethical standards: They set high standards for themselves and others and act with integrity.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on these characteristics:\n\n(A) Margaret Thatcher: She was a charismatic leader with a clear vision for change, particularly in terms of economic policies. She implemented a series of transformative reforms, which qualifies her as a transformational leader.\n\n(B) Mikhail Gorbachov: He played a significant role in ending the Cold War and promoted glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in the Soviet Union. These efforts demonstrate his transformational leadership qualities.\n\n(C) Nelson Mandela: He worked tirelessly to end apartheid in South Africa and advocated for racial reconciliation. His vision, compassion, and moral authority make him an exemplary transformational leader.\n\n(D) Bill Clinton: He was an effective communicator and could be considered charismatic. However, his presidency did not bring about transformative changes on a national or international level, which is a key aspect of transformational leadership.\n\nBased on the evaluation, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Bill Clinton",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what a Gantt chart is and what each of the given options represent.\n\nA Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule, including the start and end dates for various tasks, and the duration of each task.\n\nNow, let's examine each of the provided options:\n\n(A) Work flow design: A work flow design is the process of creating an organized and efficient sequence of steps or operations to accomplish a specific task or achieve a particular goal. A Gantt chart may show the flow of tasks in a project but it is not its primary purpose.\n\n(B) Work schedule design: A work schedule design is the process of organizing and planning work hours, shifts, and breaks to optimize productivity and resource usage. Gantt charts are frequently used to visualize work schedules, making this option more relevant.\n\n(C) Work rate design: Work rate design refers to the process of determining the speed or efficiency at which a task can be completed. While a Gantt chart may indicate the duration of tasks, it doesn't directly address work rate.\n\n(D) Work output design: Work output design involves organizing and planning the production process to achieve the desired output. Although a Gantt chart can help manage the tasks involved in the production process, it doesn't specifically focus on work output design.\n\nBased on the explanations above, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Work schedule design",

Let's go through each option:\n\n(A) Referent power: This type of power is derived from the likability or attractiveness of an individual. It is not directly related to their status or position in an organization, but rather their personal qualities. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.\n\n(B) Expert power: This type of power is derived from an individual's knowledge or expertise in a particular area. While this might be relevant to someone in a high position, it is not directly related to their status or position within the organization. Thus, this option is not the correct answer.\n\n(C) Reward power: This type of power comes from an individual's ability to distribute resources or rewards within an organization. While it could be associated with someone in a high position, it is not the only way that power can be derived from status or position. Therefore, this option is also not the correct answer.\n\n(D) Legitimate power: This type of power is derived from the formal authority within an organization.
