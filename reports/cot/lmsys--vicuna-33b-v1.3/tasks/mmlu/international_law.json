            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The question is related to the jurisdiction of States in respect of crimes committed on board vessels.\n2. I need to identify which State is typically responsible for exercising jurisdiction in such cases.\n3. I should consider the various possibilities: the coastal State, the flag State, all States, or the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.\n4. I need to evaluate each possibility based on international law principles.\n5. I recall that the flag State usually has jurisdiction over its vessels, regardless of where the vessel is located.\n6. However, I also know that the coastal State has jurisdiction over crimes committed within its territorial waters.\n7. I need to consider whether there are any exceptions or specific rules that apply in this context.\n8. I remember that the term \"vessel\" in this context refers to ships, boats, and other craft that navigate on the high seas.\n\nBased on my reasoning and the information provided, the answer is:\n\n(B) The flag State",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we can reason as follows:\n\n1. Understand the concept of justiciability: Justiciability is a legal term that refers to the ability of a court or tribunal to hear and decide a case.\n2. Analyze the options: We can examine each option and see if it aligns with our understanding of justiciability.\n3. Compare the options to the concept: (A) It is not about the enforcement of a right per se, but the court's ability to decide on the matter. (B) This option is close, but it focuses more on the nature of the right rather than the court's ability to decide. (C) This option is close, but it focuses more on the non-enforcement of a right rather than the court's ability to decide. (D) This option does not talk about the court's ability to decide, but the state's obligation.\n4. Choose the best option: The best option is (B) Justiciability refers to the just nature or cause of a particular right, as it is the closest to the concept of justiciability, which focuses on the court's ability to decide.\n\nHowever, after further reflection, option (B) does not fully capture the meaning of justiciability. A more accurate answer is:\n\n(A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the differences between Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention.\n\n1. First, I will look at the definitions of both terms. R2P is a principle that states countries have a responsibility to protect their citizens from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, and the international community has a responsibility to assist if the state is unable or unwilling to do so. Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, is a situation where a state uses military force to prevent or stop widespread suffering or violations of human rights, without the permission of the state where the violations are occurring.\n2. Next, I will identify the key differences between the two concepts. One difference is that R2P focuses on preventing humanitarian crises, while humanitarian intervention usually involves military force to stop an ongoing crisis. Another difference is that R2P emphasizes the role of the international community in assisting the state in distress, while humanitarian intervention is often carried out by a single state without the approval of the international community.\n3. Based on my analysis, I can say that R2P is different from humanitarian intervention because:\n\n(A) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress, and\n(B) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(C) R2P is different from humanitarian intervention because it requires a call for assistance by the State in distress and it is less arbitrary due to UNSC input, with the primary objective being to avert a humanitarian crisis.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we first need to understand the concept of the peaceful settlement of disputes in international law. The peaceful settlement of disputes is a fundamental principle of international law that emphasizes resolving conflicts and disputes between states without the use of force.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) This option suggests that the obligation of peaceful settlement of disputes is an obligation of result, meaning states are under a strict obligation to resolve their disputes as soon as possible. However, this is not accurate because the peaceful settlement of disputes is not an obligation of result but rather an obligation of conduct.\n\n(B) This option states that the peaceful settlement of disputes is an obligation of conduct, meaning states have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means. This interpretation is more accurate as it reflects the principle's nature as a guideline for states to follow in resolving conflicts.\n\n(C) Option (C) claims that the peaceful settlement of disputes is a peremptory norm of international law and that all states have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute. Peremptory norms, also known as jus cogens, are fundamental principles of international law from which no derogation is permitted. However, the peaceful settlement of disputes is not a peremptory norm but rather a general principle of international law.\n\n(D) According to option (D), the peaceful settlement of disputes is an obligation that only concerns international courts and tribunals. This option is not accurate either, as the peaceful settlement of disputes is a principle that applies to all states, not just international courts and tribunals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) It is an obligation of conduct, ie States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means.
