            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking to identify the right size of cannula to be used for a rapid blood transfusion as per 2020 medical knowledge. \n\nStep 2: Explain cannula sizes and their uses. Cannula sizes are measured in gauge (G). Larger gauge numbers represent smaller diameter cannulas, whereas smaller gauge numbers represent larger diameter cannulas. Moreover, cannulas with larger diameters can transfer blood more rapidly than those with smaller diameters.\n\nStep 3: Consider the purpose of the cannula. In this case, the main goal is to provide a rapid blood transfusion. Therefore, we should choose the cannula with the largest diameter to ensure efficient blood transfer.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options. The options for cannula gauges are (A) 18 gauge, (B) 20 gauge, (C) 22 gauge, and (D) 24 gauge.\n\nStep 5: Select the correct cannula gauge. Since we are looking for the cannula with the largest diameter, the correct answer is the option with the lowest gauge number. \n\nStep 6: Provide the answer. Based on the information available and the given options, the correct cannula size for a rapid blood transfusion (as of 2020 medical knowledge) is (A) 18 gauge.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which of the following is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis, we will analyze each option and explain our reasoning:\n\n(A) Stridor: Stridor is a high-pitched sound which may occur while breathing due to constricted airways. In anaphylaxis, airways can be obstructed due to swelling or bronchoconstriction, leading to stridor.\n\n(B) Bradycardia: Bradycardia is a slower heart rate. Although anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition that can affect the cardiovascular system, typically, it is associated with an elevated heart rate (tachycardia) rather than a slowed one.\n\n(C) Severe wheeze: Similar to stridor, severe wheezing is caused by the constriction of airways due to bronchoconstriction or inflammation. This is a common symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\n(D) Rash: Skin rash (urticaria) is a common symptom of anaphylaxis since it's often mediated by the release of histamine, causing itching, redness, and bumps on the skin.\n\nNow we can determine which option is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis:\n\nOption (B) Bradycardia is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

There are four options: (A) anaerobic contribution, (B) pH of muscle falls, (C) blood glucose falls, and (D) relative contribution of aerobic metabolism.\n3. Sprinting is an anaerobic activity, so we should expect that option (A), anaerobic contribution to progressively increase with an increasing number of sprints.\n4. The other options are not directly related to an increasing number of sprints: (B) pH of the muscle could be influenced by lactic acid build-up during anaerobic exercise, but the consequence in question is the number of sprints. (C) blood glucose might be impacted by sprints, but the total consumption of energy from all sources increases instead of falling below 3 mmol/L. (D) aerobic metabolism does not directly relate to an increasing number of sprints.\n5.

            "model_answer": "Assessing the statements step-by-step:\n\n(A) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered. \n\nReasoning: This statement is mostly true, as covering one eye inhibits the brain from receiving two different images, thus eliminating diplopia. However, this does not guarantee that diplopia will never occur as some instances might not require both eyes to be open.\n\n(B) The outer image is always the false image.\n\nReasoning: The outer image is not always the false image. In diplopia, images can appear both in the inner and outer parts of the visual field, and determining which one is the false image primarily depends on the root cause.\n\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards.\n\nReasoning: A fourth nerve palsy, also known as superior oblique palsy, affects eye alignment, causing an abnormal head position or tilt to compensate for the deviation. However, it is not solely induced by looking upwards. A fourth nerve palsy can occur spontaneously because of several factors, such as congenital weakness, trauma, or neurological disorders.\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint.\n\nReasoning: A sixth nerve palsy, also known as abducens nerve palsy, impacts the lateral rectus muscle, causing a convergent squint, not a divergent one.\n\nAnswer: (A)",
