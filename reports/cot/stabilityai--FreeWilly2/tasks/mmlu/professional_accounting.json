            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Firstly, we need to calculate the total daily income from the limousine rental:\n\nDaily Income = Hourly Rate x Hours Rented per Day\nDaily Income = $245 x 2 hours\nDaily Income = $490\n\nNext, we need to consider the daily costs:\n\nDaily Cost = Daily Cost per Day\nDaily Cost = $50\n\nNow, we calculate the daily profit by subtracting the daily cost from the daily income:\n\nDaily Profit = Daily Income - Daily Cost\nDaily Profit = $490 - $50\nDaily Profit = $440\n\nWe need to calculate the yearly profit by multiplying the daily profit by the number of days worked. Since we are working every day, we can use the following formula:\n\nYearly Profit = Daily Profit x Total Working Days\nYearly Profit = $440 x 365\nYearly Profit = $160,600\n\nNow, we calculate the yearly yield on investment by dividing the yearly profit by the initial cost of the limousine and multiplying by 100:\n\nYearly Yield on Investment = (Yearly Profit / Initial Cost) x 100\nYearly Yield on Investment = ($160,600 / $98,000) x 100\nYearly Yield on Investment = 1.64\n\nThe final yield should be expressed as a percentage, so we can remove the decimal point:\n\nYearly Yield on Investment = 164%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) 164%",

So, the statement is true for a nonissuer.\n\n(B) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\nThis statement also applies to nonissuers (and issuers) as it is a possible reason for nonsampling risk.

It requires calculating the bond's effective interest rate, based on its current market value, and using that rate to calculate interest expense over time.\n\nStep 3: Compare the correct method with the incorrect method\n- The straight-line method allocates the bond premium evenly over the life of the bond, which does not accurately reflect the change in market value over time.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the effects of using the incorrect method on the given amounts at June 30 year 12\n- Bond carrying amount: The carrying amount will be understated since the incorrect method does not consider the change in the bond's market value.\n- Retained earnings: Retained earnings will also be understated, as the incorrect method leads to a lower bond premium amortization, and thus a lower interest expense, which will result in unrealized profits.\n\nAnswer:\n(B) Understated Overstated",

This statement seems correct.\n\n(B) It will be classified as a current asset.\n\nAssets held for sale are considered non-current assets on a company's balance sheet.
