The Dickey-Fuller (DF) approach to unit root testing is widely used in testing for the presence of a unit root in the time series data.\n2. The Phillips-Perron (PP) test is another popular method for unit root testing.\n3. Both tests are based on the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model.\n4.

Therefore, this feature cannot be captured by the GARCH(1,1) model.\n\n) Leverage effects\n\nA GARCH(1,1) model is capable of capturing leverage effects, as it allows for asymmetric impact of past squared errors on future volatility. This implies that when returns are negative, their influence on volatility is stronger than when returns are positive.\n\n) Volatility clustering\n\nGARCH(1,1) models describe the phenomenon where large shocks in volatility are followed by subsequent periods of high volatility. This effectively captures volatility clustering, which is often observed in financial time series.\n\n) Volatility affecting returns\n\nSince the GARCH(1,1) model only deals with conditional variances, it does not capture the direct impact of volatility on returns.\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can conclude that a standard GARCH(1,1) model captures leverage effects (ii) and volatility clustering (iii).

We will use this knowledge to estimate the value of the GARCH-in-mean parameter.\n\nStep 2: Reviewing the possible outcome of GARCH-in-mean parameter estimation\nWe need to recall that the potential range of GARCH-in-mean parameter estimates used in GARCH-M modeling is as follows:\n- If the parameter is less than -1, it indicates explosive behavior of the volatility.\n- If the parameter is between -1 and 0, it means leverage effects are present in the data.\n- If the parameter is between 0 and 1, it means a mean-reverting behavior.\n- If the parameter is bigger than 1, it indicates that volatility shocks have a prolonged effect.\n\nStep 3: Applying the context to determine the answer\nWe need to consider the corporate bond percentage returns being used as input to the GARCH-M model. Corporate bond returns are commonly seen as less volatile and less risky compared to other types of securities, such as stocks. Based on this information, we can expect the GARCH-in-mean parameter to be within a certain range.\n\nStep 4: Choosing the correct answer\nConsidering the context and the characteristics of corporate bond percentage returns, we can eliminate options A (less than -1) and D (bigger than 1) because corporate bonds are less volatile. As a result, options B (between -1 and 0) and C (between 0 and 1) are more appropriate. Since B refers to leverage effects and C refers to mean reversion, it is more likely that the corporate bond percentage returns would exhibit mean reversion behavior due to their lower risk and volatility. \n\nAnswer: (C) Between 0 and 1",
