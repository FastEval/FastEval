            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "tackle the question using a step-by-step approach and evaluating each option based on the available information:\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization - There is no mention of cerebral infarction in the information provided. Additionally, the sensation is in the thigh, which is not an area that would typically be affected by a cerebral infarction.\n\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement - The main concern here would be risk of infection or thrombosis due to the filter. However, these complications typically manifest as pain and swelling, not sensory changes. \n\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve - This nerve provides sensory innervation to the anterior and lateral aspects of the thigh. Compression could lead to sensory alterations. Given that the area of decreased sensation is described on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh, this seems like a plausible explanation.\n\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh - A hematoma can potentially compress nerves, potentially leading to sensory changes. However, the hematoma is mentioned as having resolved upon discharge from the hospital, which makes this explanation less likely.\n\nConsidering the available information, the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation would be:\n\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.",

Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated.

            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n 1. The woman is in active labor at 39 weeks.\n2. She was having regular contractions every 4 minutes but now has intermittent, weak contractions.\n3. She is experiencing pain and has received medication twice in the past 6 hours.\n4. No obstructed labor is evident upon examination.\n5. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated.\n\nBased on this information:\n- (A) Braxton Hicks contractions are unlikely because she is in active labor and the changes in her cervix show that she is progressing.\n- (B) Lower uterine retraction ring is unlikely because the uterus is functioning, the head is engaged, and the cervix is dilating.\n- (C) Hypotonic uterine dysfunction is also unlikely due to the head being engaged and normal fetal heart tones.\n\nThis leaves us with option (D) primary dysfunctional labor as the most likely diagnosis. This is because the labor has been progressing but with weak contractions. The other options don't fit the circumstances as well.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

Atrial fibrillation and cor pulmonale are not mentioned in the findings, so they can be ruled out. We also do not have any information on systemic hypertension, so we cannot determine the outcome from this information. Tricuspid valve regurgitation does not seem to be the primary focus of the patient's medical condition based on the details provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the answer is:\n\n(C) Systemic hypertension. \n\nThis is because the information on mild cardiomegaly, left ventricular prominence, and left ventricular hypertrophy suggests that the patient may be at risk for developing systemic hypertension in the future but we do not have enough information to confirm this as the most likely outcome.",

She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers.

The patient experiences numbness in the right hand, specifically in the right ring and small fingers, which have also been tingling for the past 2 months. There is no history of serious illness or medication, and the vital signs are normal. However, she works as a cashier and uses a computer at home, suggesting possible repetitive motion.

An increased concentration of malonyl-CoA could inhibit or promote certain processes.\n\nStep 2: Review the options and identify which process could be directly inhibited by increased malonyl-CoA concentration.\n\n(A) Fatty acid oxidation: Malonyl-CoA inhibits the carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) enzyme, which is responsible for allowing fatty acids to enter the mitochondria to be oxidized. Thus, the increased malonyl-CoA concentration could inhibit fatty acid oxidation.\n\n(B) Fatty acid synthesis: Although malonyl-CoA inhibits CPT-1, it may not have a direct inhibitory effect on fatty acid synthesis.\n\n(C) Gluconeogenesis: Gluconeogenesis is not directly involved in the metabolic processes that malonyl-CoA influences.\n\n(D) Glycogenolysis: Glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate for energy production. This pathway is not known to be directly inhibited by malonyl-CoA.\n\nStep 3: Choose the most likely process to be inhibited by increased malonyl-CoA concentration.\n\nBased on the analysis, the increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits (A) Fatty acid oxidation.\n\nAnswer: A",
