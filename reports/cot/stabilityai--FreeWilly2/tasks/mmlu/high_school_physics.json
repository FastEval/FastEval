With the non-uniform distribution of charges on the surface of the object, it can be inferred that there will be a distribution of electric field lines that accumulate and cancel each other in various regions.\n\nStep 3: The electric field outside any symmetrical charge distribution, such as spherical or cylindrical, remains zero due to the equal and opposite electric field lines canceling each other. However, the given object is not symmetrical with a non-uniform charge distribution. This suggests that the electric field lines can not be completely canceled.

A second block is placed on top and we have to find the condition that the small block will not slide off.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given options for the conditions - All options involve a coefficient of static friction, which checks if there is enough friction between the blocks to prevent the small block from sliding off.\n\nStep 3: Consider forces acting on the small block - When the original block is moving towards its equilibrium position, its velocity is fastest. When the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, its velocity is slowest.
