            "question": "Suppose that an expansionary fiscal policy leads to a large increase in real output and a small increase in the price level. From this it can be inferred that\n\n(A) inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus.\n(B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n(C) aggregate supply decreased.\n(D) aggregate demand is steeply sloped.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "In an expansionary fiscal policy, government spending increases and/or taxes decrease, causing an increase in aggregate demand. When the price level increases, it indicates that the economy is reaching its capacity (or halfway to it) for the current prices. A small increase in the price level means that this expansionary fiscal policy only slightly increased the economy's production capacity. This, in turn, implies that:\n\n(A) inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus - Wrong. We have no given information about the state of inflation before the policy.\n(B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources - Right. The small increase in the price level means that the increase in aggregate demand did not push the economy towards its capacity, meaning that there were still unemployed resources in the economy.\n(C) aggregate supply decreased - Wrong. The policy is the government trying to increase the supply, so there's no indication that aggregate supply decreased.\n(D) aggregate demand is steeply sloped - Wrong. The small increase in the price level suggests that there was still slack in the economy, so the aggregate demand is not steeply sloped.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answer is (B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.",

Aggregate demand (AD) is the total demand for goods and services in an economy during a specific time period.\n\nStep 2: Understand the changes\nWhen both SAS and AD increase, it means that the level of output produced by businesses responds more positively to price changes, while there is also an increase in the overall demand for goods and services in the economy.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the options\nOption A, real GDP falls while the price level rises, contradicts the fact that both SAS and AD are increasing.\nOption B, both the price level and real GDP rise, contradicts the fact that businesses can produce more (SAS increasing) only if they receive appropriate incentives, which would be changes in the price level.\nOption C, the price level rises but the change in real GDP is uncertain, could be partially true as SAS is increasing. However, with increasing AD, it\u02bcs likely that real GDP also rises.\nOption D, real GDP rises but the change in the price level is uncertain, is true as increasing AD would lead to an increase in real GDP, but the increase in SAS promotes an uncertain change in price level.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is option C: The price level rises but the change in real GDP is uncertain.\n\nFinal line: (C)",

            "correct_answer": 1,

Expansionary monetary policy typically involves lowering interest rates or increasing the supply of money in the economy, which can lead to higher inflation expectations. Higher inflation expectations can subsequently reduce the demand for bonds and push bond prices down.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option B\nOption B states that contractionary monetary policy might cause falling Treasury bond prices. Contractionary monetary policy typically involves raising interest rates or reducing the supply of money in the economy, which can lead to stronger demand for bonds because of their fixed interest rate payments. As a result, bond prices could increase, rather than fall.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option C\nOption C states that a depreciating dollar might cause falling Treasury bond prices. A weaker domestic currency could lead to higher inflation, as the cost of imports increases. This in turn could reduce bond demand and cause bond prices to fall.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate option D\nOption D states that fiscal policy designed to reduce the budget deficit might cause falling Treasury bond prices. A decrease in government deficit spending might lead to reduced issuance of new bonds. However, it is unlikely to be a primary cause of falling bond prices as it is a longer-term structural change in government fiscal policy, rather than an immediate market driver.\n\nBased on the evaluation of each option, Option A - expansionary monetary policy - seems to be the most plausible cause of falling Treasury bond prices.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

            "model_answer": "First, let's break down each statement and analyze the relationship between households and money as an asset:\n\n(A) Nominal GDP falls: When nominal GDP falls, it means the total value of goods and services in an economy decreases. This generally leads to economic contraction and possibly higher unemployment, reducing household income and potentially affecting their demand for money as an asset.\n\n(B) The nominal interest rate falls: A decrease in the nominal interest rate might increase the demand for money as an asset, as lower rates make other investment options less attractive and less lucrative. As a result, households may hold more money as an asset.\n\n(C) Bond prices fall: When bond prices fall, yields increase; this makes bonds more attractive to investors. Bonds compete with money as an asset, so a decrease in bond prices might slightly decrease the demand for money as an asset.\n\n(D) The supply of money falls: A decrease in the supply of money in the economy could lead to higher interest rates and an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money. As a result, households may demand less money as an asset.\n\nBased on these analyses, the answer is: (C) Bond prices fall.\n\nFinal answer: C",
