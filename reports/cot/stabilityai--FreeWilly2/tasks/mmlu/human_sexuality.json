            "question": "Which of the following methods of detecting breast cancer involves exposure to radiation?\n\n(A) Needle aspiration\n(B) Mammography\n(C) Mastectomy\n(D) Lumpectomy",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each method and find out if it involves exposure to radiation:\n\n(A) Needle aspiration: This is a procedure that uses a thin needle to remove fluid or tissue from the breast. There is no exposure to radiation involved in this method.\n\n(B) Mammography: This is an X-ray examination of the breast, typically used for detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. X-rays involve exposure to a small amount of radiation.\n\n(C) Mastectomy: This is a surgical procedure to remove all or part of the breast tissue. There is no exposure to radiation involved in this method.\n\n(D) Lumpectomy: This is also a surgical procedure, similar to a mastectomy, that removes only the tumor and some surrounding tissue from the breast. There is no exposure to radiation involved in this method.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only method of detecting breast cancer that involves exposure to radiation is mammography (option B). \n\nAnswer: (B)",

            "model_answer": "(A) vary from person to person\n\nTo answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. The question asks about the regions of the body that are sexually exciting when touched.\n2. Option (A) states that these regions vary from person to person.\n3. Option (B) advocates that the regions vary for women during the different phases of the menstrual cycle.\n4. Option (C) suggests that the majority of these regions are located on the lower portion of the body.\n5. Option (D) favors a combination of all three of these statements.\n\nConsidering the given options, the answer should be (A) vary from person to person, as it is the most general and inclusive option. People have different preferences, and certain areas may be sexually exciting to some but not others. Likewise, while the location of these regions can change based on gender, individual biology, and other factors, the fundamental truth is that people have different preferences and experiences.",

Symptoms include painful urination, green, yellow, or white discharge from the penis or vagina, and sometimes fever or pain in the abdomen. Gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics. If left untreated can lead to infertility or other health problems.\n\nStep 3: Assess the statements based on gathered information:\nA) can be treated with antibiotics - True (gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics)\nB) has a high risk of infection with a single exposure - True (based on information, gonorrhea can be caused by exposure to an infected partner)\nC) is asymptomatic (without symptoms) in only a small percentage of those infected - True (some people infected with gonorrhea may not show symptoms)\nD) infections are limited to genital areas - True (gonorrhea primarily affects the genital areas)\n\nStep 4: Identify the correct statement(s):\nBased on the gathered information and assessment of the statements, the correct statements are:\nA, B, C, and D\n\nOutput: (ABCD)",

            "question": "You are a homosexual male: Last night, you were tempted by lusty, swarthy Jacques (the king of fraternity row) to join him at the local dairy bar for a tall cool glass of milk. You also briefly considered studying for this test, but Jacques won out. In Freudian terms, which of the following was dominant?\n\n(A) the id\n(B) the ego\n(C) the superego\n(D) the Oedipus complex",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, we'll evaluate each option:\n\n(A) the id: The id is the part of the psyche that contains our instinctive and primitive desires. In this scenario, Jacques represents temptation and desire.\n\n(B) the ego: The ego acts as a mediator between the id and the superego and helps us make decisions based on reality. It is responsible for our reasoning and decision-making processes.\n\n(C) the superego: The superego contains our conscience and the morals we have learned from society and our upbringing. In this case, studying for the test would be the more responsible choice.\n\n(D) the Oedipus complex: This is a term that Freud used to describe a certain type of conflict during a child's development. It is not relevant to the scenario given.\n\nSince the question states that Jacques was the chosen option and was tempted by lustful desires, it is the id that is dominant.\n\nAnswer: (A) the id",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let us analyze each option and its corresponding reasoning:\n\n(A) Paraphilias guarantee survival of the species - This option states that paraphilias guarantee survival of the species, but there is no direct evidence to support this idea. While it is true that some paraphilias may contribute to more diverse mating behaviors, the assumption that they guarantee survival is merely speculative. \n\n(B) Evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli - This option could be a possibility, as evolutionary selection may have favored males who are more receptive to novel stimuli. This advantage could have played a role in attracting females and increasing their reproductive success. \n\n(C) Of left brain/right brain differences between the genders - This option suggests that differences in brain lateralization between males and females may have some effect on the prevalence of paraphilias. While there are indeed differences in brain lateralization between the genders, the connections and relations to paraphilias still need more research and evidence.\n\n(D) Male brains are better developed than are female brains - This option is discredited and is not supported by sociobiology research as it is based on outdated, patriarchal beliefs. \n\nBased on the analysis, the most plausible reason for the higher occurrence of paraphilias in males is probably (B) evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli. This option suggests that there could be an evolutionary advantage for males to be more receptive to novel sexual stimuli, which could have contributed to the higher prevalence of paraphilias in males.\n\nAnswer: (B)",
