Some businesses might profit even without these barriers. \n\nC) All sources of elastic demand - Elastic demand refers to the change in the quantity demanded of a good or service in response to a change in its price. While it might influence demand, these terms are not synonymous with elastic demand. \n\nD) All barriers to entry - Barriers to entry are hurdles that prevent or make it difficult for new firms to enter a market. Patents, control of resources, economies of scale, and exclusive licenses can all limit the ability for new businesses to enter the market and can thus be considered barriers to entry.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) all barriers to entry",

Therefore, the best fit from the given options is:\n\n(B) constant-cost industry\n\nReasoning:\n\nSince the industry uses a small fraction of the total plastic, the cost of producing army figures is expected to remain relatively constant because the overall demand for plastic will have a minor effect.",
