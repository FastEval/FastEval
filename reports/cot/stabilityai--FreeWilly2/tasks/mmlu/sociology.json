            "model_answer": "Mass-society theory refers to the idea that individuals within a mass society are influenced by large-scale, impersonal institutions. It is important to consider each option in light of this theory:\n\n(A) The content of the media is determined by market forces - This statement is partly related to mass-society theory, as it implies that the media is shaped by economic considerations, which could lead to a mass society.\n\n(B) The subordinate classes are dominated by the ideology of the ruling class - This statement is relevant to mass-society theory because it emphasizes the potential for the lower classes to be influenced by the dominant ideas held by the ruling class. This aspect could lead to a more homogeneous and controlled mass society.\n\n(C) The media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers - This statement directly reflects the concept of the mass society, where a large number of individuals are influenced or manipulated by media and may become passive consumers.\n\n(D) Audiences make selective interpretations of media messages - This statement is somewhat related to the mass-society theory, but it focuses more on the audience's active role in interpreting meanings. It's not as directly tied to the concept of mass society as the other options.\n\nConsidering the options and their relevance to mass-society theory, the best answer is:\n\n(C) the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers\n(C)",

Looking closely at each option:\n\n   - Option A is about social groups, resources, and competition, which is in line with the ecological approach.\n   - Option B is about wildlife and natural habitats on the edges of the city, which is not directly related to the ecological approach to urban sociology.\n   - Option C is about collective protests about environmental issues, which is not the main focus of the ecological approach.\n   - Option D is about gender and their use of public spaces, which is not the main focus of the ecological approach.\n\n5.

Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies introduced the concept of gemeinschaft, which is a type of social grouping based on shared values, relationships, and traditions.\n\n2. Organic solidarity is a term used by Emile Durkheim to describe social cohesion based on the interdependence of specialized roles in complex societies. Although there is some overlap between gemeinschaft and organic solidarity in terms of interdependence, gemeinschaft emphasizes shared values while organic solidarity focuses on role specialization.\n\n3. Mechanical solidarity is another concept by Durkheim, which refers to social cohesion based on shared values, common beliefs, and similar lifestyles, very similar to the idea behind gemeinschaft.\n\n4. Gesellschaft is the term used by T\u00f6nnies to describe a type of social grouping based on formal, impersonal relationships between people. This is a contrasting concept to gemeinschaft, which emphasizes the importance of informal, personal relationships.\n\n5. Anomie is a concept by Durkheim referring to the breakdown of social norms and less social regulation. This is not related to the characteristics of gemeinschaft.\n\nResulting answer: (B) mechanical solidarity",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\n \n(A) This option states that rates of income tax increased equally for all occupational groups. If this were the case, we could expect some redistribution of income through the tax system. However, this doesn't necessarily imply a growth in income inequality itself. \n\n(B) This option suggests that there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them. This could lead to higher wages for those who do hold professional jobs, thus increasing income inequality. However, professionals only make up a small proportion of the population, and this alone wouldn't necessarily lead to a significant growth in overall income inequality.\n\n(C) The statement that the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings has the potential to increase income inequality, depending on which income groups were affected more by the rising prices and how much of their incomes were spent on consumer goods. \n\n(D) The option suggesting growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits might contribute to income inequality because such people become dependent on state support, which could lead to their incomes being lower relative to those of full-time workers. However, it doesn't necessarily explain the growth in income inequality as a whole.\n\nOut of these options, C appears the most plausible as it would mainly affect lower income groups, leading to a larger disparity between the rich and poor.

This highlights the core concept of Marxist feminism, where societal structures are synonymous with class-based power dynamics.\n\n(C) - This option highlights the exploitation of women's domestic labor by the capitalist economy, which is another aspect of Marxist feminism.
