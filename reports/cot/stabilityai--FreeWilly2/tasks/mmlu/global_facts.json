This involves adjusting for the changes in the value of money, often referred to as inflation.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) adjustment.\n- PPP accounts for the differences in the cost of living and prices across countries or, in this case, across time, to determine the amount of goods and services that can be purchased with the same amount of currency.\n\nStep 5: Apply PPP adjustment to the 1850 GDP per capita in 2011 USD.\n- After applying the PPP adjustment, we determine that the GDP per capita in the US in 1850 when adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices is:\n\n(D) About $15k",

            "model_answer": "ment to society.\n\nStep 1: Consider the recent data available on the topic.\nAs of 2019, the most recent data was collected by Pew Research Center, which did not ask about the acceptance of homosexuality directly. However, they did ask about a related topic: same-sex marriage. This provides a good indication of people's attitude towards homosexuality in the United States.\n\nStep 2: Determine the acceptance of same-sex marriage.\nThe study showed that, as of 2019, 61% of American adults support same-sex marriage. Although this is not directly related to acceptance of homosexuality by society, it's reasonable to deduce that this percentage is indicative of general acceptance of homosexuality in the United States.\n\nStep 3: Match the found percentage with the answer choices.\nSince the percentage of people supporting same-sex marriage in the United States as of 2019 is around 61%, we can now try to match this with the closest option from the given answers.\n\nComparing the found percentage of 61% to the answer choices:\n(A) 52% - too low\n(B) 62% - close, but not exactly 61%\n(C) 72% - too high\n(D) 82% - too high\n\nSince the answer choices do not exactly match the percentage found, we need to choose the closest option. Therefore, we choose option (B) because it's the most closely matching choice and it would indicate that about 62% of Americans say homosexuality should be accepted by society.\n\nFinal Answer: (B) 62%",
