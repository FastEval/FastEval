            "model_answer": "It is essential to identify key sources of information to determine the credit standing of retail businesses. Each of the given options (A \u2013 D) should be analyzed on the basis of credibility, accessibility, and relevance to credit ratings of retail businesses.\n\n(A) the Retail Merchants Association\nRetail Merchants Association can be a good source of information for retail businesses in general, as they can provide insights into market trends, business practices, and networking events. However, their primary focus is usually on advocacy, support, and promoting collective interests of its members, not necessarily on credit ratings.\n\n(B) the local chamber of commerce\nA local chamber of commerce serves as a good source of information for businesses operating within a specific geographical area. They can provide insights on local market conditions, business opportunities, and networking events. However, their primary focus is usually on advocacy, support, and promoting the collective interests of its members, not necessarily on credit ratings.\n\n(C) Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.\nDun & Bradstreet, Inc. specializes in providing business credit reports and ratings, primarily focusing on creditworthiness. The company gathers information from various sources and analyzes the data to generate credit risk assessments for businesses. This makes it the most relevant source for obtaining credit ratings for retail businesses.\n\n(D) the United States Retail Credit Association\nThe United States Retail Credit Association is a trade association that would most likely provide insights for retail businesses and may touch upon factors impacting credit scores. However, it is not directly focused on credit rating and creditworthiness like Dun & Bradstreet.\n\nBased on our reasoning above:\n\nThe final line containing the answer is (C) the Retail Merchants Association. (Note: This should have been (C) Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. instead. A typo was made within the text, so the correct answer is shown inside the brackets.)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we first need to understand the concept of resistivity and how temperature affects it.\n\nResistivity is the ability of a material to resist electrical conduction. Materials with high resistivities have low conductivities, meaning they are poor conductors or superb insulators. As temperature increases, the resistance of most materials also increases.\n\nNow, let's analyze each material:\n(A) Copper: A good conductor with high thermal conductivity, therefore its resistance is quite sensitive to temperature changes.\n\n(B) Carbon: Found in various forms (diamond, graphite, etc.) and widely used in electronics, its resistivity varies with temperature depending on the form. Generally, graphite has a lower and more constant resistivity than other forms, whereas diamond has a higher resistivity.\n\n(C) Germanium: A semiconductor that is sensitive to temperature changes, so its resistance is affected by temperature variations.\n\n(D) Silicon: A semiconductor material, but unlike Germanium, it has a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) of resistance. This means that its resistance decreases as the temperature increases. As a result, its resistance is least affected by temperature changes compared to the other materials.\n\nAnswer: (D) Silicon",
