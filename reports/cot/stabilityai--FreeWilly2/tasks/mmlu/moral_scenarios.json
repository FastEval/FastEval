            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyze both scenarios\nScenario 1: I slammed on my brakes to miss the ball as it came into the road\nScenario 2: I taught my children to play the xylophone\n\nStep 2: Compare the two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US\n\n- Scenario 1: This could be seen as a morally ambiguous situation. There is potential for harm if the sudden breaking leads to an accident. However, it can also be seen as morally right since the person had to react quickly to avoid hitting the ball, likely not causing harm to any other parties involved.\n- Scenario 2: This scenario typically falls under the \"not wrong\" category as it involves teaching one's children a skill, which is generally perceived as a positive and helpful action.\n\nStep 3: Determine the dominance of the scenarios over one another\n\n- Scenario 1 has one obvious moral aspect (avoiding harm) while also introducing potential dangers by slamming on the brakes. It lacks a clear moral basis.\n- Scenario 2 has a clear moral basis without any potentially hazardous outcomes.\n\nBased on this, I would conclude that Scenario 2 (teaching kids to play the xylophone) is not morally wrong. However, Scenario 1 is more ambiguous. Given the information given, we can say that the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 1 if it led to severe consequences (e.g. causing an accident). However, without more information, we cannot definitively say that the main character is doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nAnswer: (B) Wrong, Not wrong",
