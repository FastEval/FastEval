            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Examine the options and identify the general elements related to each option.\n\n(A) The coastal State -> This refers to the State which possesses a coastal area where the vessel is found.\n(B) The flag State -> This refers to the State whose flag is flown by the vessel in question.\n(C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction -> This implies that any State can exercise jurisdiction regardless of its relation to the vessel.\n(D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea -> This is an international body that handles disputes related to maritime law.\n\nStep 2: Analyze international conventions, laws, and practices related to jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels.\n\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides a treaty basis for maritime jurisdiction. According to UNCLOS, a State can exercise jurisdiction over a crime committed on board a vessel if they have a \"national connection\" to the vessel or suspect involved.\n\nStep 3: Compare the options with the international conventions and laws, and select the best fit.\n\n(A) The coastal State -> They may have jurisdiction if the vessel is within their coastal waters, but not necessarily for all crimes occurring on board.\n(B) The flag State -> This is the State that has the closest national connection to the vessel, which would give them jurisdiction in most cases.\n(C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction -> Though there may be joint jurisdiction in some cases, it is not true that all States enjoy jurisdiction over crimes in a vessel.\n(D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea -> May handle disputes but doesn't exercise jurisdiction over crimes on board vessels.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best fit is:\n\n(B) The flag State",

            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyzing the nature of Responsibility to Protect (R2P)\n\nResponsibility to Protect (R2P) is a global political commitment made by the member states of the United Nations to prevent the occurrence of four mass atrocity crimes - genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. It encourages the international community to take necessary actions to protect populations from these crimes and to assist states in exercising their responsibility to protect their people.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the nature of humanitarian intervention\n\nHumanitarian intervention is the deployment of military or other forms of assistance by a state or coalition of states to alleviate extreme human suffering in a foreign country, without the consent of the government of that country. It primarily focuses on the alleviation of suffering in the face of widespread loss of life.\n\nStep 3: Comparing R2P and humanitarian intervention to find the differences\n\n(A) R2P is not essentially the same as humanitarian intervention, as R2P is a global political commitment to prevent specific mass atrocity crimes, and humanitarian intervention is a form of assistance to alleviate suffering, which might also involve the use of force.\n\n(B) R2P does not require a call for assistance by the State in distress; rather, it aims to provide assistance even when the government is unwilling or unable to protect its population.\n\n(C) R2P differs from humanitarian intervention as it has a broader focus on the prevention of atrocity crimes rather than just alleviating suffering. Additionally, it requires some input from the United Nations Security Council, and its primary objective is to avert crises, rather than merely reacting to them.\n\n(D) R2P may involve military force but is not restricted to it; on the other hand, humanitarian intervention is not required to involve armed force and primarily focuses on alleviating suffering.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer to the question is:\n\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.",

            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) The UK Constitution's only source of power is that of the sovereign - This statement is incorrect as the UK Constitution also derives power from other sources such as statutory laws, common law, and conventions.\n\n(B) The UK Constitution gives the judiciary the power to overturn acts of parliament - This statement is partially true, but it's not the best description of the UK Constitution. Judicial review can be used to challenge acts of parliament, but ultimately, the judiciary cannot overturn acts of parliament; it can merely declare them incompatible with other laws, human rights, or the constitution.\n\n(C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources - This statement is accurate. The UK Constitution is uncodified, meaning that it's not written in a single document, but consisits of various sources such as statutory laws, common law, and conventions.\n\n(D) The UK Constitution is based on a Bill of Rights - This statement is also partially true, but the UK Constitution is not exclusively based on a Bill of Rights. The UK has the Human Rights Act 1998, which incorporates parts of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law, but the Constitution is also based on other sources like the aforementioned statutory laws, common law, and conventions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best description of the UK Constitution would be option (C), as it accurately describes the uncodified nature and the various sources of the UK Constitution.\n\nOutput: (C)",

This would suggest that States have a legal duty to resolve disputes instantly, which may not be feasible in all cases.\n\n(B) It is an obligation of conduct, ie States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means. This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes. This approach focuses on the process of resolving disputes, recognizing the attempts to do so without guaranteeing a specific outcome.\n\n(C) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute. This implies the importance of peaceful dispute resolution; however, it suggests that all States are responsible for ensuring the application of such norm, which may not always be realistic.\n\n(D) It is an obligation which concerns solely international courts and tribunals. This interpretation limits the obligation to the domain of international courts and tribunals and does not encompass the obligations of individual States to resolve their disputes.\n\nUpon analyzing these four statements, options (A), (C), and (D) either set unrealistic expectations or limit the scope of the obligation to certain groups or parties. Option (B), however, captures the essence of the obligation to resolve disputes through peaceful means, without imposing strict requirements on the outcome or placing undue burden on individual States.\n\nAnswer: (B)",
