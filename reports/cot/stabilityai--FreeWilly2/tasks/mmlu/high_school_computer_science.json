            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand x << 3\n\nWe're asked to evaluate x << 3, where x is 1. In Python, the << operator is a bitwise left shift operator. It shifts the bits in the binary representation of a number to the left by a certain number of positions.\n\nStep 2: Convert x to binary\n\nTo understand the shift, we need to first convert 1 to its binary representation.\n   1 = 00000001 (in binary)\n\nStep 3: Shift the bits to left by 3 positions\n\nNow we apply the bitwise left shift by 3 positions to the binary representation.\n   00000001 (binary) << 3\n\nStep 4: Show the result\n\nThe bits in 00000001 have been shifted to the left by 3 positions.\n   00000007 (in binary)\n\nStep 5: Convert back to decimal\n\nNow we just need to covert the binary result back to decimal.\n   7 (in decimal)\n\nAnswer: (D) 16 (incorrect)\n\nExplanation: In Python 3, the bitwise left shift operator (<<) only returns the shifted binary representation. Therefore, we cannot directly compare it to the given options. The decimal equivalent of the shifted binary number itself is 7, which is not among the given options. We either need to convert our shifted binary number to decimal and then choose the closest match from the given options, or provide the actual decimal value of x << 3 as the answer.",

A photographer is manipulating a digital image and overwriting the original image. Which of the following describes a lossless transformation of the digital image?\n\n(A) Compressing the image in a way that may lose information but will suffer only a small loss of image quality.\n(B) Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image. The new value of each pixel represents a shade of gray, ranging from white to black.\n(C) Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255.

This doesn't result in any loss of information and is a reversible process. It can be converted back to the original color image.\n(C) Creating a negative image reverses the colors and values. This is also a lossless transformation since it's reversible; the original image can be recovered by doing the same transformation again.\n(D) Modifying part of the image with the copied pixels may result in loss of information or change the original contents.\n\nConsidering each method, we can conclude that both (B) and (C) describe lossless transformations of the digital image.
