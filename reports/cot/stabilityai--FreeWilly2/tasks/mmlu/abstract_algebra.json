In essence, it says that from any group there can be precisely isomorphic images (by homomorphisms) of factor groups constructed from the group.\n\nStatement 2: Here, we are comparing homomorphic images and factor groups of a group G (with respect to up to isomorphism).

The kernel of a ring homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that map to zero in the co-domain. It's well known that the image of any element in a ring homomorphism is uniquely determined by the positive powers of that element. If the kernel is {0}, this implies that all other elements have unique images. Therefore, the ring homomorphism is one-to-one (injective). This statement represents a valid proof that the statement A is true.\n\nNow let's look at statement 2. A subset Q is an ideal in a commutative ring R if it is a subgroup of the additive group of R, and furthermore:\n1. Any element in Q times an element in R is also in Q (left-multiplication property)\n2. Any element in R times an element in Q is also in Q (right-multiplication property)\n\nAs Q is given as an ideal in R, we can infer that both left- and right-multiplication properties hold.
