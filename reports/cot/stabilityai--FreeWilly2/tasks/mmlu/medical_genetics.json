            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "s''''''''''''''''''''''''\n\nFirst, let's review what a Robertsonian translocation is. A Robertsonian translocation occurs when two acrocentric chromosomes (chromosomes with a small, non-functional arm) fuse at their centromeres, resulting in a single metacentric chromosome (chromosome with a functional arm).\n\nNow let's examine each answer option:\n(A) telomeres. - Telomeres are the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes, so they are not involved in the direct fusion process.\n(B) centromeres. - This is correct since Robertsonian translocation occurs when two centromeres fuse together.\n(C) histones. - Histones are proteins that help package DNA, so they are not involved in the direct fusion process.\n(D) ends of the long arms. - It's the ends of the chromosomes that fuse, not specifically the ends of the long arms.\n\nBased on our understanding of a Robertsonian translocation, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) centromeres.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question.\nThe question is about the frequency of affected males in a human population with an X-linked recessive condition. We are given a frequency of 0.1 for affected males (in XY chromosomes). The expected frequency for affected females (XX chromosomes) needs to be determined.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the situation.\nIn X-linked recessive conditions, the gene causing the condition is present on the X-chromosome. Females have two X-chromosomes, hence they can be carriers without being affected. Males have only one X-chromosome, so if they inherit the mutated gene, they will be affected.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the frequency of affected females.\nTo derive the frequency of affected females, we assume that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; therefore, the frequency of heterozygous females ( carriers) equals the square of the frequency of affected males:\n\ncarrier frequency = square(affected male frequency)\n\nAs given:\naffected male frequency = 0.1\n\nWe substitute this value:\ncarrier frequency = square(0.1)\ncarrier frequency = 0.01\n\nSince each female has two X-chromosomes, there are two possible outcomes for each chromosome (normal or mutant). The frequency of affected females equals\n\naffected female frequency = 2 * carrier frequency\naffected female frequency = 2 * 0.01\naffected female frequency = 0.02\n\nStep 4: Select the correct option.\nThe calculated affected female frequency is 0.02, which corresponds to option (C).\n\nAnswer: (C) 0.02",

The mapping of human chromosomes has indeed been more successful due to the availability of large numbers of DNA markers.\n\nC. This statement is incorrect.
