            "question": "A police officer carries out hundreds of traffic stops every year. When his supervisor is reviewing the officer\u2019s records for the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of various genders, ages, and races. However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child. What psychological framework would directly address the unconscious bias in his behavior? \n\n(A) Behaviorist\n(B) Psychoanalytic\n(C) Cognitive behavioral\n(D) Humanistic",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) Behaviorist: This framework focuses on the idea that all behaviors are learned, either through conditioning or observation. It does not address unconscious biases directly.\n\n(B) Psychoanalytic: This framework, founded by Freud, delves into the unconscious mind and past experiences that may be underlying causes of present behavior. It focuses on uncovering and understanding these unconscious forces. This sounds like the best fit so far.\n\n(C) Cognitive behavioral: This framework combines cognitive therapy (examining thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) and behavior therapy (changing problematic behaviors). Although it does examine cognitive processes, it does not seem like the most suitable choice for addressing unconscious biases directly.\n\n(D) Humanistic: This framework emphasizes self-awareness, personal growth, and free will. It focuses more on the conscious aspects of an individual's behavior and choices and is not concerned with unconscious biases.\n\nBased on the given options, the best choice for directly addressing the unconscious bias in the officer's behavior is (B) Psychoanalytic. This framework would help explore the officer's past experiences and unconscious motivations, which in this case is related to his abusive relationship with his father.",

However, this is 68 years after 1886. So, he cannot be the one who set the world record in 1886.\n\n(B) S Coe - Sebastian Coe is a British middle-distance runner who set multiple world records in the 800 meters and 1500 meters events. However, he was born in 1956, which means he could not have set the world record in 1886.\n\n(C) J DiMaggio - Joe DiMaggio is a former world-class baseball player in the United States. He is not known for achievements in running or in the mile race specifically.\n\n(D) WG George - WG (Henry George Reginald) George was a British runner who set multiple world records in the 1-mile race during the 1880s and 1890s.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "t When someone engages in very high intensity exercise, their muscles deplete their stores of phosphocreatine (PCr). PCr is a key source of energy for muscles, especially during short, intense bursts of activity. After such exercise, the body needs to resynthesize PCr to replenish these stores. The rate at which PCr resynthesis occurs depends on the availability of a key substrate, creatine.\n\nWhen the body needs energy, it combines creatine with a phosphate molecule to create PCr. This process is an ATP-dependent reaction, and it allows the muscles to quickly store and release energy. As a result, the rate of PCr resynthesis is often coupled to the rate of creatine availability in the body.\n\nCreatine synthesis can occur within the body or be taken up from our diet. Simply altering dietary intake or supplementation can have a significant effect on PCr resynthesis rates.\n\nGiven that the resynthesis of PCr is coupled to the rate of creatine availability, and because creatine is a relatively slow-changing substrate in the body, we can reasonably conclude that resynthesis would take the longest among the options provided.\n\nDue to the slow rate of change in creatine levels, the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise typically takes about:\n(D) about 4 minutes.",

            "question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, which of the following statements is the author likely to agree with?\n\n(A) Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use.\n(B) Patients on a diet would benefit from sauna use.\n(C) Salt restriction would be equal to sauna use for hypertensive patients.\n(D) Patients with skin conditions may be cured with sauna use.",
