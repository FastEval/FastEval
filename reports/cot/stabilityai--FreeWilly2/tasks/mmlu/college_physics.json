We're given that the quantum efficiency of the photon detector is 0.1 (10%). \n\nAs the photons are sent one after the other, this is essentially a Bernoulli trial. The probability of detecting a photon is 0.1, with a success being a detection and a failure being a missed detection.\n\nThe expected number of detected photons can be found by multiplying the total number of photons (100) by the probability of detection (0.1).\n\nExpected number of detected photons = 100 * 0.1 = 10 \n\nSince it's a Bernoulli trial, the standard deviation (SD) of the distribution of results can be calculated by multiplying the probability of detection (0.1) by the number of trials (100).\n\nSD = sqrt(100 * 0.1) = 10 * sqrt(10)\n\nNow let's approximate the square root of 10, which is around 3.16.

Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\n\n(A) 500 nm\n(B) 550 nm\n(C) 600 nm\n(D) 650 nm",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the most strongly reflected wavelength, we first examine the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. White light is normally incident on a puddle of water with an index of refraction (n) of 1.33. The water can be considered as a first medium. The incident light ray will undergo refraction.\n\n2. The oil layer (thickness = 500 nm) with an index of refraction of 1.5 floats on the surface of the water. The oil can be considered as the second medium.\n\n3. Air, with an index of refraction of 1.0, can be considered as the third medium above the oil layer.\n\nNow let's examine the requirements for the most strongly reflected wavelength:\n\n4. We will find the wavelength where the reflected intensity is maximum (or phase change is \u03c0).\n\n5. Snell's law states that n_i*sin(\u03b8_i) = n_r*sin(\u03b8_r), where n_i is the refractive index of the incident medium, \u03b8_i is the angle of incidence, n_r is the refractive index of the refracted medium, and \u03b8_r is the angle of refraction.\n\n6. The critical angle is defined as the angle of incidence (\u03b8_c) where the angle of refraction is 90\u00b0. By Snell's law, we get \u03b8_c = arcsin((n_r / n_i)).\n\n7. For total internal reflection (TIR) to occur, the angle of incidence must be greater than or equal to the critical angle. In our situation, the critical angle is 41.22\u00b0 (when medium 1 is water and medium 3 is air).\n\n8. At the interface between water and oil, TIR does not occur since water has a higher refractive index than oil (n_i=water, n_r=oil).\n\n9. Considering the given wavelengths (A: 500 nm, B: 550 nm, C: 600 nm, D: 650 nm), we examine which one would have the most significant phase change at the oil-air interface.\n\n10. For wavelength A, the angle of incidence is approximately 34.25\u00b0 (for the water-to-oil interface), and for wavelength D, it is approximately 42.32\u00b0 (for the oil-to-air interface).\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe most strongly reflected wavelength is (A) 500 nm, since it has the closest approach to the critical angle among the given wavelengths options.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

So, we can rule out option (A).\n\n(B) The Pauli exclusion principle: This principle states that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously in an atom. This is not only an essential concept in explaining the arrangement of electrons in the atomic shells but also provides a basis for showing that the ortho- state has a lower energy than the para-state. By analyzing the spin-orbit interactions that occur when electrons are in para and ortho states, it is evident that the ortho state is more stable. This makes option (B) the most likely explanation.\n\n(C) The Bohr model of the atom: The Bohr model is a simplified explanation of the atom which describes the electron's position around the nucleus based on energy levels and orbits. Although classical in nature, it does not accurately explain the behavior of electrons and energy levels in an excited state.
