            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The word 'murtis' is derived from Hinduism and is commonly associated with religious icons or images. In this context, it generally refers to the physical representations of deities that are worshipped during religious rituals within Hinduism.\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Offerings: These refer to the items or gifts given to deities as part of worship or religious ceremony. While the term 'murtis' might involve some form of offerings, it is not primarily translated as such.\n\n(B) Prayers: These refer to the devotional words or actions performed during religious rituals, typically directed towards a deity. The word 'murtis' does not directly represent or translate to the concept of prayers.\n\n(C) Apparitions: This term refers to the appearance of a ghostly or spectral figure. Although a 'murti' might have a spiritual significance, it is not equivalent or translated as an 'apparition'.\n\n(D) Idols: An idol is an image or representation of a deity which is worshipped. This aligns more closely with the term 'murtis' as it refers to a physical representation of a deity in a religious context.\n\nConsidering the options, 'Idols' (D) is the closest and most appropriate translation for 'murtis'.\n\nAnswer: (D) Idols",
