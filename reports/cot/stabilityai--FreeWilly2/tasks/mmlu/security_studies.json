            "model_answer": "Step 1: Know the principles of the responsibility to protect.\n\nThe responsibility to protect is a framework of protecting populations from four types of severe crimes against humanity: genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing. The main elements of this principle are:\n\n(A) The responsibility to prevent.\n(B) The responsibility to react.\n(C) The responsibility to rebuild.\n(D) The responsibility to remain sovereign.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate each principle to determine which one is not a part of responsibility to protect.\n\n(A) The responsibility to prevent is to prevent the worst crimes against humanity from happening by addressing root causes like discrimination, marginalization, and the violation of human rights. This principle is within the responsibility to protect.\n\n(B) The responsibility to react focuses on responding to situations where the worst crimes against humanity are on the verge of occurring or have already occurred. This principle is within the responsibility to protect.\n\n(C) The responsibility to rebuild primarily concerns efforts to help affected countries rebuild after conflict and atrocities to prevent a recurrence of these crimes. This principle also falls within the responsibility to protect.\n\n(D) The responsibility to remain sovereign centers around respecting the sovereignty of nations and ensuring that they are able to protect their populations from severe crimes against humanity without resorting to external intervention. This principle is not an element of the responsibility to protect as it actually contradicts the responsibility to act based on the framework.\n\nStep 3: Provide the answer.\n\nThe answer is (C) The responsibility to remain sovereign, as it is not an element of the responsibility to protect framework. Instead, it contradicts the principle of reacting and rebuilding when severe crimes against humanity occur.\n\nAnswer: (C)",

So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",

            "model_answer": "A) Although environmental changes can lead to economic growth diversification and technological advancements, the potential instability caused by these changes may still conflict with national security interests.\n\nB) Environmental changes can undermine national security, weakening the economic base and the military capacity, but it is not guaranteed that this will always be the case.\n\nC) The majority of environmental problems are indeed internal to countries, however, external threats like climate change may still be a significant concern for national security.\n\nD) Considering all the options mentioned, it is sensible to say that environmental changes can be reconciled with national security interests to some extent, but that ultimately depends on the specific situation and challenges faced by individual countries.\n\n(D)",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

Economic conservatism is less common among liberal beliefs.\n3. Liberals often believe in promoting equality, peace, and cooperation.\n\nNow, let's examine each statement and see if it aligns more with a liberal perspective:\n\n(A) Emphasizes economic interconnectedness as a means of preventing conflicts over energy resources. This aligns with a liberal perspective, as it prioritizes economic cooperation and peace.\n(B) Suggests that energy scarcity could lead to new international order, characterized by statism and neo-mercantilism, which is not in line with liberal beliefs.\n(C) Focuses on oil being the foundation of the current order and benefits capitalist economic elites, with an emphasis on social justice. This perspective is not entirely liberal in nature, even though it advocates for an equal distribution of power and wealth.\n(D) Predicts an increase in geopolitical confrontation due to energy scarcity, leading to potential \"resource wars\" and breakdowns in international cooperation. This perspective is not concerned with promoting peace or cooperation, which goes against liberal beliefs.\n\nComparing all four statements, (A) aligns most with a liberal perspective, as it discusses the potential for economic cooperation to prevent conflict over energy resources.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

This criticism implies that the concept of human security could be used to justify such actions under the guise of promoting security for all.\n\n(B) Human security promotes global capitalism.\n\nThis criticism suggests that the concept of human security might support the ideals of capitalism and might even lead to its increased global prominence, potentially causing harm to certain groups of people in the process.\n\n(C) Human security is too broad.\n\nThis criticism claims that the concept of human security encompasses a wide range of issues, possibly making it difficult to implement effectively and lead to confusion about what is specifically meant by \"human security.\"\n\n(D) All of these options.\n\nGiven that the individual criticisms (A, B, and C) all represent viable concerns regarding the human security concept, it appears that option (D) could indeed be a valid criticism as well.\n\nAfter evaluating the criticisms, the answer is:\n\n(D) All of these options.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated.\n(D) Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated.
