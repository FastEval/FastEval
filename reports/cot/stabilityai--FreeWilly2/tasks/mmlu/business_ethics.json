            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the key elements in the context.\n- Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly mainstream\n- Ethical implications\n- Associated with being expensive and secure (or cheap and insecure)\n- Used for both legal and illegal purposes\n\nStep 2: Compare the key elements with each answer choice.\n\n(A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime -> This choice recognizes the relation between cryptocurrency and associated ethical implications, and that they have been used for financial crime. However, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are often considered more secure. \n\n(B) Traditional currency, Cheap, Unsecure, Charitable giving -> This choice does not relate to the context of cryptocurrencies and ethical implications, but refers to traditional currency.\n\n(C) Cryptocurrencies, Cheap, Secure, Financial crime -> This choice recognizes the relation between cryptocurrency and associated ethical implications, and that they have been used for financial crime. However, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are often considered expensive.\n\n(D) Traditional currency, Expensive, Unsecure, Charitable giving -> This choice does not relate to the context of cryptocurrencies and ethical implications, but refers to traditional currency.\n\nStep 3: Conclude with the answer after comparing each option with the context.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the most appropriate answer is (A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial crime",

            "question": "Typical advertising regulatory bodies suggest, for example that adverts must not: encourage _________, cause unnecessary ________ or _____, and must not cause _______ offence.\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Considering each aspect mentioned -\n\n1. Encourage:\n   A) Unsafe practices - This is discouraged by advertising regulatory bodies as it may lead to harm or damage.\n   B) Wants - While ads may create desire for a product or service, they shouldn't encourage unsafe practices.\n   C) Safe practices - Advertising regulatory bodies typically encourage ads that promote safe practices.\n   D) Distress - This is typically discouraged, as ads should not cause emotional distress to the viewers.\n\n2. Cause unnecessary:\n   A) Fear - Ads should not needlessly instill fear in the audience, as this could cause distress.\n   B) Wants - This is not necessarily something ads should cause unnecessarily, as it depends on the context.\n   C) Jealousy - Ads may provoke feelings of envy or wanting what others have, but this is not necessarily deemed as 'unnecessary'.\n   D) Serious - This doesn't make sense in the context of advertising regulatory bodies, as seriousness is subjective.\n\n3. Cause:\n   A) Trivial offence - The focus of advertising regulatory bodies is usually on more significant issues, not trivial ones.\n   B) Serious offence - Ads should not cause serious offence, as this might lead to negative consequences for the brand and its stakeholders.\n   C) Offence in general - Ads should not offend viewers or cause discomfort or upset, regardless of the severity of the offence.\n   D) Necessary offence - It's unlikely that regulatory bodies would permit any necessary offence in ads.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the best choice is (B) because it emphasizes the importance of not encouraging unsafe practices, causing unnecessary distress, and not causing serious offence.\n\n(B)",

It does not necessarily relate to the balance between work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\n(B) Absenteeism: This is about employees frequently being absent from work, usually without a valid reason. This does not address the balance between work-related and non-work-related activities either.\n\n(C) Work-play balance: This option does not explicitly mention the work-related and non-work-related activities. Although it could be related, options (D) and (A) provide a clearer description. \n\n(D) Work-life balance: This term refers to finding the right split between work-related and non-work-related activities.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze the question and the possible answers:\n\n- Industrial supply loops: This refers to the relationship between manufacturers, suppliers, and customers in the production process, limited to manufacturing industries.\n- Industrial ecosystems: This refers to the interdependent network of industries and their various processes in the creation, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.\n- Ecological ecosystems: This refers to natural ecosystems, focusing on organisms and their environment.\n- Corporate ecosystems: This refers to cooperation among companies within a specific market or industry, while considering factors like capital, human resources, and knowledge. \n\nNext, let's analyze the context of the question:\n\nThe question is about a balanced network of interdependent organisms and their environments, which adds value to sustainability thinking due to the inclusion of companies and industries together with resources and wastes. This points towards a system that considers the interdependence between various types of organisms, environments, and resources. \n\nLastly, let's match the context with the most fitting answer:\n\nThe most fitting answer is (B) Industrial ecosystems, since it's a network of industries and processes within various industries that exchanges resources and wastes, similar to how ecosystems function in nature. Industrial ecosystems are also relevant to sustainability thinking as they incorporate the interdependence between the involved companies, industries, and resources. Furthermore, the focus on \"bound together\" indicates that this term considers the relationships among industries.\n\nAnswer: (B) Industrial ecosystems",
