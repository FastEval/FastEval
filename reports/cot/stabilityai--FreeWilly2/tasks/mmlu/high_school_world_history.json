            "model_answer": "mFirst, let's analyze the given passage step-by-step:\n\n1. The passage emphasizes the importance of preserving peace.\n2. Without peace, independence and rehabilitation of countries would hold little meaning.\n3. Revolutions will not be allowed to run their course.\n4. The author suggests that we can mobilize spiritual, moral, and political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace.\n\nHaving read the passage, we can conclude that it most prominently emphasizes the need for cooperation and unity among Asian and Africans nations to safeguard peace. \n\nNow, let's evaluate the provided options:\n\nA) The formation of the non-aligned movement: The passage's key idea is preserving peace which could be related to the non-aligned movement, an alliance of countries that wishes to stay neutral during the Cold War. This seems like a good fit.\nB) Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation: Although the passage discusses the importance of peace, it does not discuss disarmament or nuclear proliferation, making this option less plausible.\nC) The Green Revolution in agriculture: This option is not mentioned in the passage in any way, so it's unlikely to be the correct answer.\nD) Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology: This option is somewhat similar to the idea behind the passage \u2013 mobilizing Asia and Africa's strength to protect peace, but lacks the specificity of the passage's focus on peace.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer is option (A) The formation of the non-aligned movement. Sukarno played a leading role in the formation of the non-aligned movement in Bandung in 1955, which is discussed in the passage.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

            "model_answer": "The argument in the passage discusses the significance of early gunpowder weaponry in Europe as a response to their siege-oriented warfare, and the lack of utility of such weapons in China where their enemies were more mobile. This argument demonstrates a contrast in priorities and approaches to warfare between these two regions during this period.\n\nTo determine which large-scale question about global history aligns most closely with this information, we must analyze the options provided:\n\n(A) This question is about the strategic sharing of technologies among societies. The passage does discuss the importance of early gunpowder weapons in Europe, but does not address the sharing of these technologies between Europe and China or other societies.\n\n(B) This question relates to the reasons for European military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era. While the passage demonstrates a difference in priority between Europe and China, it is focused specifically on a limited time period rather than the broader history of military superiority.\n\n(C) This question examines the decline in Silk Road commerce after 1500 C.E. The passage is concerned with early gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China, and not the factors contributing to the decrease in Silk Road commerce.\n\n(D) This question deals with the effect of the medieval climatic optimum on cultural diffusion. The passage does not discuss climate or cultural diffusion at all.\n\nComparing each option's relevance to the information in the passage, we can eliminate options A, C, and D. While option B also touches on the relative military strength of Europe and non-Western powers, it focuses on the reasons behind the European superiority.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.",
