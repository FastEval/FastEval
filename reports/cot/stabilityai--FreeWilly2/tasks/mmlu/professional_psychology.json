Particularly, the efficiency of controlled memory processes and recognition memory decline with age.\n\nStep 4: Choose the most closely associated decline in memory with aging\nAlthough both options (A) and (C) are associated with aging, Option (A) is more closely associated with aging since overall cognitive decline affects the efficiency of controlled memory processes.\n\nFinal Answer: (A) Efficiency of controlled memory processes",
