            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the best style of fuzzer to explore paths covering every line of code in the program, let's first analyze the characteristics and methods of each style.\n\n(A) Generational: A generational fuzzer typically uses one input sample as the starting point and then makes modifications to the sample through operations like mutation and permutation. However, it does not take into account the code coverage during the generation process.\n\n(B) Blackbox: Blackbox fuzzing is performed by inputting a large number of random inputs into the program without considering its internals. This is akin to testing software without having knowledge of its internal operations. Such an approach might often miss some paths, leading to insufficient coverage.\n\n(C) Whitebox: Whitebox fuzzing, in contrast, utilizes information on the code internals and aims to maximize the code coverage during fuzzing. This means that whitebox fuzzing attempts to touch every line of code, increasing the chances of finding bugs and vulnerabilities.\n\n(D) Mutation-based: Mutation-based fuzzing takes a pre-existing input and applies a set of transformation rules to create new and possibly invalid inputs. This approach generally aims at achieving a higher coverage of the code path, following a coverage-guided technique.\n\nConclusion: Style (C) Whitebox is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the program because it takes into consideration the code's internals and aims to maximize the code coverage.\n\nAnswer: (C)",

Replay Attack: TLS uses sequence numbers and message authentication codes to protect against the replay attacks, ensuring the attacker can't replay the old messages.\n2. Server Impersonation: When a client connects to a server, TLS provides authentication of the server, so the client can check whether it's really talking to the correct server.\n\nStep 4: Determine the correct answer\nSince TLS protects against both attacks, the correct answer is (A) True, True.\n\nAnswer: (A) True, True",

What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",

While this method could work, it might be slower and less efficient than option C.\n\nBased on these explanations, the most reasonable option is:\n\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.",
