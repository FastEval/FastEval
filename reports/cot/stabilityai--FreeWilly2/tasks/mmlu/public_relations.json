            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each option, one by one:\n\n(A) Media release: A media release is a statement containing news or information sent to the media to announce an event, product launch, or other company news. It does not involve sending journalists to visit locations.\n(B) Media tour: A media tour involves organizing events for journalists to visit specific locations like company offices, manufacturing facilities, or event sites. This seems consistent with the question.\n(C) Press room: A press room is a dedicated room for journalists to work during an event, where they can access the necessary information and a quiet environment to write their articles. It also does not involve sending journalists to visit locations.\n(D) Promotional days/weeks: Promotional days or weeks involve promoting a specific product or event, but it is not directly related to sending journalists to visit appropriate locations.\n\nBased on the analysis, the tactic that involves sending journalists on visits to appropriate locations is:\n\n(B) Media tour",

            "question": "You are the vice president of public relations for a corporation that produces a well-known brand of food products. In the Albany, New York, market, one of your products has recently been found to have some contamination. While apparently not fatal, it has given a large number of consumers severe stomach cramps and other intestinal problems. The cause has been traced back to your product, which is sold throughout the nation. Your CEO wants to know what you would advise to keep the situation from becoming a public relations disaster. What should you recommend?\n\n(A) Quickly investigate to make certain your product is definitely the cause of the illness.\n(B) Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product.\n(C) Stop sales of the product in the Albany, New York, market and issue a recall for that product.\n(D) Issue a press release to the Albany, New York, market explaining how to treat the symptoms.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Assess the severity of the situation. Many consumers have been affected by severe stomach cramps and other intestinal problems due to the contamination found in one of the company's products sold in Albany, New York. While the contaminant is not fatal, it is causing a substantial adverse effect on the consumers.\n\nStep 2: Determine if the product is the main cause of the contamination. The CEO wants assurance that the product is indeed responsible for the contamination so that the company can proceed effectively and avoid a public relations disaster.\n\nStep 3: Consider the appropriate actions based on the cause. If the product is found to be the main cause, steps should be taken to stop any further damage to the company's reputation and protect consumer health.\n\nStep 4: Weigh the risks and benefits of each option. Option A focuses on investigation, but does not immediately resolve the issue. Option B is an aggressive step that could be seen as proactive, but it may not be necessary to recall all products nationwide if the problem is isolated to the Albany, New York market. Option C is more targeted but still addresses the issue by ending sales of the product in the affected market and recalling the product there. Option D may potentially be helpful to Albany consumers already affected, but it does not prevent other consumers from being impacted by the same contaminated product.\n\nStep 5: Recommend the option with the best balance of minimizing negative effects while still addressing the issue. Based on the considerations above, the most appropriate action would be option C, as it stops the product from being sold in the affected area and issues a recall for that market without disrupting sales in other parts of the country.\n\nFinal answer: C",
