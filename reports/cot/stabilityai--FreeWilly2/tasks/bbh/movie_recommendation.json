            "correct_answer": "(D)",
            "model_answer": "Let me analyze the movies mentioned.\n\nInception is a 2010 science fiction action film directed by Christopher Nolan, which focuses on a thief who is given a job to plant an idea into a target's mind via dream-sharing technology. The plot revolves around the concept of dreams and layers of reality.\n\nPulp Fiction is a 1994 American crime film directed by Quentin Tarantino. The plot is composed of several interrelated stories, taking place mostly in Los Angeles. The movie showcases violence, drugs, and crime related to the American Gothic subculture.\n\nForrest Gump is a 1994 American comedy-drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis. It tells the story of a slow-witted but kind-hearted, athletically talented man who witnesses and unintentionally influences several defining historical events in the 20th century United States.\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark is a 1981 American action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, with a story about a professor of archaeology who, thrust into a web of danger, is tasked with recovering the biblical Ark of the Covenant.\n\nConsidering the characteristics of the mentioned movies, I will now evaluate the given options:\n\n(A) Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf: This 1966 American film is a drama directed by Mike Nichols. It is based on the play of the same name by Edward Albee. It focuses on the complex and turbulent marriage between an associate professor and his wife. The movie centers around their increasingly unhinged behavior when they host another couple at their house for drinks.\n\nThe genre and theme is not similar to the previous mentioned movies.\n\n(B) Fantastic Mr. Fox: This 2009 American stop-motion animated comedy film is directed by Wes Anderson. It is an adaptation of the 1970 children's novel by Roald Dahl. The film tells the story of a former thief turned respectable, married fox who is forced to resort to his previous life when he is threatened by farmers.\n\nThe genre and theme don't have significant commonalities with the mentioned movies.\n\n(C) Clash of the Titans: This 1981 British-American fantasy film is directed by Desmond Davis. It is a retelling of the Greek myth of Perseus, who slays various creatures including the treacherous Gorgon Medusa and the snake-haired monster, the Kraken, to save Princess Andromeda.\n\nThe movie shares elements with Raiders of the Lost Ark in terms of action and adventure genre but lacks the fantastical elements of Inception.\n\n(D) Independence Day: This 1996 American science fiction action film is directed by Roland Emmerich. The film presents a story about Earth being invaded by extraterrestrial life, resulting in a full-scale battle for planet preservation.\n\nIndependence Day would be a strong candidate for similarity with Inception and Raiders of the Lost Ark. It shares the action, adventure, and sci-fi elements found in those movies. However, it doesn't relate as well to Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBased on the similarities found in the movies Inception, Pulp Fiction, Forrest Gump, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, a movie that carries some similar themes could be:\n\n(D) Independence Day",
