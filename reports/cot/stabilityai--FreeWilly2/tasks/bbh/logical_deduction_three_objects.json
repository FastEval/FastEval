The given facts: The blue book is to the right of the orange book (B > O), and the orange book is to the right of the black book (O > B).\n3. Let's create a one-dimensional space. Place the black book (B) on the left-most extreme, and the orange book (O) will be to the right side of B and the blue book (C) on the rightmost extreme.\n4. We now have the following representation in space: B - O - C\n5. Now we can examine the options in terms of their relative positions to the left or right of books mentioned in the options.\n\nOption A: The black book is the second from the left. Since B is on the left-most extreme, it cannot be the second one from the left. So, Option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: The orange book is the second from the left. Since O is right next to B in our representation, the second one from the left would be the orange book. So, Option B is correct.\n\nOption C: The blue book is the second from the left. C is on the rightmost extreme, so it is not the second one from the left. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\nAnswer: (B) The orange book is the second from the left.",
