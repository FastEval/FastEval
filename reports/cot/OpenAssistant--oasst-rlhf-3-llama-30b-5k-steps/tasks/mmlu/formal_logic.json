            "model_answer": "(A) Tdc is the best translation of David teaches Chris.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo translate the sentence \"David teaches Chris\" into predicate logic, we need to first identify the subject and the predicate. The subject of the sentence is \"David\", and the predicate is \"teaches Chris.\" The subject and the predicate together form a sentence, which can be translated into a formula in predicate logic.\n\nTo represent the subject and the predicate in predicate logic, we use variables. In this case, we can use the variables \"d\" for \"David\" and \"c\" for \"Chris\". We can then represent the predicate \"teaches\" using the symbol \"Txy,\" which stands for \"x teaches y.\"\n\nThe sentence \"David teaches Chris\" can now be translated into the formula \"Tdc,\" which represents that \"d teaches c.\" This formula is written as \"Tdc\" because \"d\" (for \"David\") comes first, followed by \"c\" (for \"Chris\").\n\nTherefore, the best translation of David teaches Chris into predicate logic is (A) Tdc.\n\nAnswer: (A) Tdc.",

            "model_answer": "(B) Some houses are bigger than all large apartments.\n\nHere is my reasoning:\n\n1. Let us first examine the meaning of the proposition: \u2200x)[(Ax\u2022Lx)\u2022(\u2203y)(Hy\u2022Bxy)] \n    (for all x, if x is an apartment (Ax) and x is large (Lx), then x is bigger than y \n    (Bxy) where y is a house (Hy)). Intuitively, this proposition is saying that if a \n    house is big, then it must be bigger than any apartment.\n2. To test the different statements, let us take an example of a building which is \n    very large: the Burj Khalifa. For this building, we ask ourselves which candidate \n    statements are true and which are not.\n3. For statement (A), the answer is false. Some large houses may be smaller than the \n    Burj Khalifa, because the Burj is exceptionally large and some houses may not be as \n    big.\n4. For statement (B), the answer is true. The Burj Khalifa is a good example of a \n    building which is bigger than almost all large houses. Few houses may exceptionally \n    large, but this is not typical.\n5. For statement (C), the answer is true. Some very large apartments may be bigger \n    than some houses, for example in a large building it is common for the top floors \n    to have very large apartments.\n6. For statement (D), the answer is false. No matter how large an apartment is, there \n    will always be houses which are bigger. This is because in principle, a house can be \n    constructed to be as big, for example by connecting multiple houses. The same is \n    not true for apartments, which are limited by the size of the building.\n   \nTherefore, the best English interpretation of the proposition is (B): some houses are \n    bigger than all large apartments.

The tilde symbol (\"~\") represents the negation operator, which indicates that the first statement within \"\u2283\" is false.

In this case, the condition is that both \"Izzy plays Minecraft\" and \"Ashleigh stops by\" are false, which implies that \"Russell makes dinner\" is true.\n\nTherefore, from the given formula of PL and the key provided, we can say that the translation of its negated form, which is the question, implies that all of the following statements cannot be true simultaneously:\n\n- Izzy plays Minecraft,\n- Ashleigh stops by, and\n- Russell makes dinner.\n\nHowever, one or both of the first two statements may be true, but the negation of the last statement must be true.
