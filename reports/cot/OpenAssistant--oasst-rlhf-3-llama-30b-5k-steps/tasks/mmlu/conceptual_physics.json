            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(C) 10 N\n\nTo find the horizontal component of a force acting at an angle, we can use the concept of inverse tangent. Inverse tangent returns the angle when it is given a ratio of two sides of a right triangle. In this case, the horizontal component is parallel to the x-axis, so we can use the x-axis as one of the sides of our right triangle.\n\nFirst, we can calculate the length of the horizontal component by multiplying the magnitude of the 10-N force (10 N) by the cosine of 45 degrees. This gives us:\n\n10 N * cos(45) = 7.07 N\n\nSo, the horizontal component has a magnitude of 7.07 N.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the answer to be rounded to one significant figure, which means we need to look at the next number after the 0. In this case, it is 7, so we round down to the nearest significant figure. This gives us answer choice (C) 10 N.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (A): \"A voltage will be induced in a wire loop when the magnetic field within that loop changes.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe correct answer can be determined by eliminating the incorrect options.\n\n1. Option (B) \"aligns with the electric field\" is incorrect. The direction of the induced current is determined based on the right-hand rule, which states that the current direction is determined by the direction of the magnetic field and the direction of the current flow. Aligning the magnetic field with an electric field does not cause a change in the magnetic field, so it does not cause an induced current.\n2. Option (C) \"is at right angles to the electric field\" is incorrect. The magnetic field direction is perpendicular to the electric field direction, but an angle between the directions does not lead to an induced voltage. The angle between the fields does not influence whether or not an induced voltage appears.\n3. Option (D) \"converts to magnetic energy\" is also incorrect. The conversion of energy from electric to magnetic or vice versa is not the only definition of induction. Induction can also occur when the magnetic field is changing, causing an electric field to be generated.\n1. Option (A) \"changes\" is correct. When the magnetic field changes direction, the magnetic field's flux linkage with the coil also changes direction. According to Faraday's law of induction, this change in the magnetic field's flux linkage with an adjacent coil causes an electromotive force (EMF) to be induced in the coil. This EMF leads to a flow of current in the coil, resulting in an induced voltage.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"A.\"",
