This phenomenon is also known as electromagnetic induction. When the magnetic field changes, the electric field lines around the wire also change, causing electrons in the wire to move, which results in an electrical current. \n\nTherefore, option (A) is correct. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect because the magnetic field does not have to align with the electric field to induce a voltage, according to the law of induction. The direction of the induced voltage depends on the direction of the changing magnetic field, not on the direction of the electric field.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because the magnetic field does not have to be at right angles to the electric field to induce a voltage, according to the law of induction. The direction of the induced voltage depends on the direction of movement of the electrons, which is determined by the direction of the changing magnetic field.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the magnetic field does not have to convert to magnetic energy to induce a voltage, according to the law of induction. The magnetic field must only be changing in order to induce a voltage, which is also known as electromagnetic induction. \n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (A).",

According to general relativity, mass does distort spacetime. This is known as the curvature of spacetime. The greater the mass, the greater the curvature of spacetime and the stronger the gravitational pull.\n\nB. Gravity also affects clocks according to general relativity. As spacetime is curved by mass, time can appear to move slower or faster depending on the strength of gravity and the velocity of an object. This is called gravitational time dilation.\n\nC. Light cannot escape from a black hole, but I'm not sure if this is a direct result of general relativity. Black holes are a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by a massive object, but the ability for light to escape relies on the curvature's strength and the object's mass.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) All of these.
