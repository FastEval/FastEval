The PP test is more efficient than the DF test for small samples, which means that it has better power to detect a unit root.\n\nTherefore, the main difference between the DF and PP approaches is that PP tests use a multiple regression approach that includes a correction for autocorrelated errors, whereas DF tests use a simple differenced equation approach and do not correct for autocorrelated errors.

This increase in price can then spur further increases in demand, thereby amplifying the initial news. In a model accounting for a leverage effect, such a feedback loop would cause the impact of news on asset prices to increase. Consequently, if the initial increase in demand was positive (i.e., positive news), there would be a further increase in demand due to the reinforcing feedback loop, and the news impact curve would be positive.\n\nIn contrast, if the initial increase in demand was negative (i.e., negative news), the reinforcing feedback loop would amplify this decrease in demand, causing the news impact curve to be negative. Overall, the presence of a leverage effect leads to a positive correlation between news and asset prices, and therefore, the news impact curve for a model accounting for a leverage effect would be zero for all positive disturbances.\n\n(D) Leverage effect would result in a positive correlation between news and asset prices, causing the news impact curve to be zero for all positive disturbances.",

            "model_answer": "Alright.\n\nFirst, let's define what the linear probability model is. It is a statistical model used in regression analysis to estimate the probability of a binary response based on one or more explanatory variables.\n\nNow, let's examine the provided statements and determine which one is false.\n\n(A) The statement claims that there is nothing in the model to ensure that the estimated probabilities lie between zero and one. This statement is false. In fact, the linear probability model is designed to constrain the estimated probabilities to lie between zero and one. Therefore, this statement is actually the opposite of what's true.\n\n(B) The statement claims that even if the probabilities are truncated at zero and one, there will probably be many observations for which the probability is either exactly zero or exactly one. This statement is also false. Truncating the probabilities at zero and one means that the estimated probabilities will never be less than zero or greater than one. Therefore, it's impossible for there to be any observations with exactly zero or exactly one probability.\n\n(C) The statement claims that the error terms will be heteroscedastic and not normally distributed. This one is true. The error terms in a linear probability model are often heteroscedastic, meaning that the variance of the error terms varies across different observations. Additionally, the error terms are not normally distributed, which violates one of the assumptions of regression analysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C). The error terms will be heteroscedastic and not normally distributed.\n\nAnswer: (C).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(D) They are usually fat-tailed.\n\nThe feature of continuously compounded returns is that they can be interpreted as the continuously compounded change in price over a given period. This means that the return can be interpreted as the change in the natural logarithm of the price over an infinitesimal time interval.\n\nAnother feature of continuously compounded returns is that they can be added over time to give returns for longer time periods. For example, if the continuously compounded return over a day is 0.05, and the return over the next day is also 0.05, the continuously compounded return over two consecutive days is 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10.\n\nAdditionally, continuously compounded returns can be added across a portfolio of assets to give portfolio returns. For example, if the returns for each of the assets in the portfolio over a given period are known, the continuously compounded return for the portfolio can be calculated by taking the weighted average of the returns for each asset, where the weights are the proportions of the portfolio allocated to each asset.\n\nHowever, continuously compounded returns are usually not fat-tailed. Fat tails are associated with excess kurtosis, which means that the distribution of returns is fatter than a normal distribution. However, continuously compounded returns are usually assumed to be Gaussian, which means that the distribution of returns is normal.\n\nTherefore, the feature of continuously compounded returns that is not observed is that they are usually fat-tailed.\n\nAnswer: (D).\n\nA side note is that in many finance books and articles, natural logarithm returns are described as continuously compounded returns, which is incorrect. It should be mentioned that it is only an approximation of continuously compounded returns. However, the mathematical equivalence theorem (Campbell and Thompson, 1987; Cumby et al., 1990) shows that the returns calculated based on natural logarithms are consistent with the realized returns in the sense that the former converges to the latter as the sampling frequency increases. So in many cases, this approximation is fine. However, it should be mentioned clearly.\n\nHere is a paper that you may find helpful: Peter Verworner, On the Convergence of Log- and Continuously Compounded Rates of Return, The Journal of Fixed Income, Peter Verworner, On the Convergence of Log- and Continuously Compounded Rates of Return, The Journal of Fixed Income, <https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/7/4/437/1037844>",
