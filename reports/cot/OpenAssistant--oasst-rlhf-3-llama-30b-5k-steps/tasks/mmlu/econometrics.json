            "model_answer": "A confidence interval is a commonly used statistical concept to estimate population parameters. It is a range of plausible values used to describe the uncertainty associated with a particular estimation of a population parameter. A confidence interval is formed based on a sample of data and the sampling distribution of a particular estimator. The values of the interval should have the property, that if the sampling process and subsequent estimation were to be repeated multiple times, and a confidence interval developed on each of these repeated samples, the overall outcome would match the property described in the definition (i.e. they contain the true value some % of the time).\n\nNow you may have guessed it:\n\n(A) A 99% confidence interval is defined as such, if 99% of the calculated intervals contain the true population value of the parameter of interest.\n\nIn contrast a p-value is used to first test if the null-hypothesis is rejected or not. If it's rejected it infers some likelihood on the corresponding alternative hypothesis (of which there are many possible hypotheses). If you correctly defined an interval this does *not* mean that the null hypothesis necessarily gets rejected or isn't -- ideally all the calculated intervals would contain both the population value AND the sample estimator. Of course out of infinitely many calculations there will be intervals where, say 1% of them do contain the population value but not the sample estimator, so we classify this interval accordingly. Without discussing the details of the sampling distribution of the respective approaches and their mathematical properties the decision rule reads: if the interval overlaps the sample estimator we do not reject the null-hypothesis, otherwise we reject it.\n\nIf you correctly defined the confidence interval: it can happen that the corresponding interval **overlaps** the sample estimator. Look up the definition of correlation on ESS (estimated sign of significance) for the official recommendation: this ESS-correlation needs to be less than -0.18, in case p_val = 0.05 (in which case the overlap-situation here is said to be \"moderate\").\n\nB, D are not correct. We can forget about C.\n\nSo:\n\nA) 99% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would contain the true value of the parameter.\n\nWe do not actually need the exact true parameter, what we get instead is a *range* of plausible values around the actually calculated sample mean. To contrast this to another common concept in science: we do not aim for luck, but for providing an informed guess of what users of statistics should aim to do: inform their consumers properly. A determined strategy of good luck, if the underlying null-hypothesis holds (which it usually does ;-) ) would mean that e.g. if 99% of all failures of single hypothesis tests are not statistically significant we would erroneously return 1% false positives (while we really intended to search for a false detection only 1% of the time). That's one reason why it might not be advisable to do hypothesis testing for exotic automated driving, for example. These are applications people actually use to win the day an so raising the false detection rate is tantamount to SELF-DESTRUCTION! Have fun in the other scenario, with a p-value of 0.10.

            "model_answer": "The main difference between the Dickey Fuller (DF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) approaches to unit root testing are as follows:\n\n* Option (B): PP tests reverse the DF null and alternative hypotheses so that there is stationarity under the null hypothesis of the PP test.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe primary difference between DF and PP tests is the way the null and alternative hypotheses are formulated. The DF test rejects the null hypothesis of a unit root if the calculated trace statistic exceeds the critical value obtained from the appropriate tabulation or software. Under the DF null hypothesis, the data are assumed to have a unit root, meaning that the variable is nonstationary. In contrast, the PP test adopts the opposite logic; it assumes unit root null hypothesis and nonstationarity under the alternative.\n\nOption (B) is correct. The PP test is a modifications of the DF test, developed by Phillips and Perron (1988) to address issues of residual serial correlation in the DF regression. Some studies find that the DF test can lead to size distortions in small samples observational studies, whereas the PP test tends to produce more desirable size properties.\n\n* (A) is incorrect because both tests are single-equation differencing approaches to unit root testing, each based on the null hypothesis of a unit root.\n* (C) is incorrect because smoothing methods are not the defining characteristic of the PP test\nThere is ongoing debate in the literature regarding which test produces most reliable results in practice, and the answer is often mixed and depends critically on the features of the data or problem at hand. However, the DF test remains a foundational tool for time series analysis, and, as the underlying rationale and logistic specific to both tests are shared in large measure, comfort with one test normally implies comfort with the other.\nThere are recently developed alternative panel-data tests available (notably the Luintel, /article/PIIS0265403321000499), in recognition of frequently encountered situations in join these procedures employ a technique called \"common correle,\" which is designed to render validly calculated test statistics and critical values -- and, therefore improved sampling properties.\nSince the augarium correlated errors drive most of the distortion in null sampling properties of time-series unit-root tests -- indeed, these were the only feature of the test statistic exploited by the Perron_cles procedure recently pproved -- this approach likely tends to fare significantly better than the DF and PP tests under a wider variety of conditions. Strictly speaking then, the idealized and relatively rare body of application scenarios for which both of these two tests should be accepted as reasonable yardsticks for a null-inference unit-root hypothesis exists. As things now stand, acceptance of having committed to any given a priori selected a test procedure or class of procedures across a wide array of settings cannot be avoided (yet), and appropriate empirical evidence always must be collected on any given set of time series. Time will perhaps permit further improvement here, above and beyond truly unit-root reaequilibrating versions of stationary GARCH models of endogenously or exogenously generated univariate time-series behaviors\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because both tests are single-equation differencing approaches to unit root testing, each based on the null hypothesis of a unit root.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because the PP test does not precicely inoculate automatic correction for autocorrelated residuals, it is true to say that application of the PP test can react to serially correlated residuals in a performance\u2013enhancing way. Potentially severe null-inference distortions measured when(3 \u00a3 4,2,2 ses tests) alternative hypothUai tube unit-root models do tend to be less pronounced under small-sample contingency scenarios in practice.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because both tests capture rather poor power properties in rather small samples \u2014a quality that prevails under all, or all-but-the-one scenarios entertained hera\nThe potential gains irt reducing null inference to a single independent normally distributed statistic renders the PP test more attractive than the DF partner this biasing and samplvers property, even for the same versions of the PP test\nagainst different versions of the DF test) The modest price to be paid for improved actions is that the PP test results rely more intently on the nature of the GLS weights, except for the least->sensitive case of 6. for none of the time series lengths,of 20,40",

This is because negative alpha values capture the idea that a large change in returns leads to higher variance for the returns in future periods.

An alpha estimate above 1 signifies that slow adjustment speed, corresponding to inefficient market pricing, and a beta estimate above 1 signifies inefficient pricing of risk premia.\n\nFinally, it is important to keep in mind that the GARCH-in-mean model represents the conditional expected value of the squared intra-day of financial asset returns over a short horizon line, or the variance of the returns, as a function of the conditional condit extra returns at the previous period.
