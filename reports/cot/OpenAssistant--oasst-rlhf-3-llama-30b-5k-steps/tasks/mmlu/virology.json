            "model_answer": "The answer is not clear as there are different ways to define \"globally\". Based on the options given, I would answer that the correct answer is (D) Tuberculosis.\n\nHere is why:\n- Option (A) and (B) refer to infectious diseases that are primarily relevant in certain parts of the world such as low-income countries. This is well documented in public health research, for example by the Lancet series on infectious diseases. On the other hand, Tuberculosis is a disease affecting poor and rich parts of the world, and thus does not seem to be limited to specific regions.\n- Option (C) Malaria is similar to (A) and (B), but the majority of Malaria cases are in sub-Saharan Africa. According to the WHO, there were 257 000 Tuberculosis deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2020, compared to 180'000 deaths due to Malaria.\n- Option (D) Tuberculosis, or TB is a serious lung disease caused by bacteria in the Mycobacterium family. Given my background knowledge, I think that this option is the best answer preferred by the average user.\n\nIn summary, all options could be valid depending on what \"globally\" mean, but Tuberculosis seems to  be the disease causing the highest number of deaths worldwide.

During this period, the virus needs some time to replicate and spread throughout the body. It is a time when the virus is not yet detectable and when the person is not yet contagious. It is commonly believed to last a few hours, although it can last for days or even weeks, depending on the virus and the individual's immune system. This period is important as it allows for early detection and isolation of infected people before they start spreading the disease and infecting others.

            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) Exclusively formula fed for six months.\n\nReasoning:\nIn countries with limited access to safe water and low levels of education, formula feeding is preferable because the conditions make it difficult to maintain proper hygiene during preparation and storage of expressed breast milk, which increases the risk of contamination and infection. Formula feeding is also a safe and effective alternative to breastfeeding, as it provides all the necessary nutrients needed for a baby's growth and development.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that newborn infants in countries with limited access to safe water and low levels of education should be exclusively formula fed for six months.",

            "model_answer": "Can you provide more information about Contingency Management?\n\nOne definition of it is, Contingency management is a type of intervention that uses reinforcements to promote positive behaviors, such as recovery from substance use disorders. The goal of contingency management is to increase the likelihood of the desired behavior by associating it with positive outcomes and to decrease the likelihood of negative behaviors by removing the positive outcomes associated with them.\nIt goes on to say that Contingency management can be used in a variety of settings, such as addiction treatment centers, community-based programs, and healthcare settings.\nThree Steps 1. Identify the Target Behavior: References indicate that the first step in implementing contingency management involves identifying the target behaviors that you want to reinforce or encourage through reinforcements.\n2.  Establish Contingencies: The second step is to establish the contingencies, or rules, for earning reinforcement. These rules detail the conditions that must be met for a participant to earn reinforcement and determine the nature and value of the reinforcement. \n3. Deliver Reinforcements: The final step involves delivering the reinforcements for target behaviors. It is this step that makes contingency management a behavior modification intervention and also the focus of this article.\n\nA.\n\nPsychology Today writes about Contingency Management for Addiction Treatment that, Contingency management (sometimes called motivational incentives) is based on the old adage \u201cyou get what you pay for.\u201d\nBehavioral therapists know that the people they treat often don\u2019t have much motivation for engaging in treatment or making good decisions (e.g. to stay sober and/or abstinent given the opportunity. The idea behind contingency management is to arrange a lot of opportunities for \u201csmall wins\u201d to build up overall motivation and confidence. \n\nThe techniques and strategies used in Contingency Management in Addiction Treatment include:\n\u2022 Providing tangible \u201crewards\u201d for engaging in certain behaviors. For example, \u2212 Providing tokens (e.g. movie passes, haircuts, restaurant meals), receivable for engaging in and being successful at certain therapy or treatment goals \u2022 Rewarding any positive behavior or even \u201ctrying\u201d\n\u2022 Building on past success, \u201csmall wins.\u201d E.g. moving up a \u201clevel\u201d for progress in assigned levels of difficulties or by achieving new goals.\n\nC.\n\nOne example of contingency management is providing incentives to service members to refrain from using drugs and getting treatment for injuries. In this case, service members were identified and enrolled in a Demonstration. The service members whose records suggested they might not develop problems met face-to-face with enrollment personnel to review their clean drug tests. Service members with problems specified retroactively by the random sample data went to these clinics to provide a single random sample. After this visit, service members were excluded from further intervention and resumed normal testing.\nAll others entered a contingency management program that purchased their urine for each of two consecutive weeks. A purchased urine in this instance is one that reveals no evidence of drug use, despite claims to the contrary.\nD.\n\nThe Clinch River Interagency Narcotics Task Force (CRIMINAL JUSTICE) case study wrote ..individuals who successfully completed treatment were placed on probation for a period of one year. Pretrial cases were supervised more closely than post-conviction cases. As part of the intensive outpatient probation (IOP), clients were required to report to a probation officer two times per week, take weekly drug tests, and perform any mandatory substance abuse treatment program assigned by the probation officer. All probationers participating in the program were tested using a rapid, roadside, saliva-based drug testing device. (Remeron - Body-worn Drug Testing). Powerscreen devices, manufactured by Syntron, wyoming Michigan, identified tryptamines, benzodiazepines, opiates, amphetamines (including Ecstasy), methadone, PCP, and marijuana (includinghashish).\nIn addition to weekly drug tests, the IOP sampled the entire supervised sample at two-month intervals to test for the same drugs. The two-month sample was\ndrawn from a random sample of clients, all clients in substance abuse treatment, and a sample of clients from each of the five rural coal counties who had",

            "model_answer": "The most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is (D) Clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells.\n\nThe adaptive immune system is a type of immune system that is specific to each individual by recognizing specific markers which are not present in the body itself, called self. This specificity is derived from a limited repertoire of special receptors which are randomly generated by somatic recombination of gene segments. Any new antigen encountered by an immune system must be recognized by its three-dimensional shape and other properties; for this purpose, antibodies (secreted by B cells) contain a fragment which is specifically complementary in shape to the antigen. Helper T cells recognize and bind to antigens only through their specific antigen receptors.\n\nThe original set of immunoglobulin rearrangements which occur during early development of the immune system lead to a random repertoire of receptors. Between 10^9 and 10^10, i. e. one to a few hundred different B cell receptors exist in each individual. Antibodies specific for the paternal Major Histo Compatibility Complex are formed before birth through fetal B cells maturing in the spleen. During the lifetime of an individual immune response against new diseases or pathogens lead\u2014in case of exposure\u2014to affinity maturation which further enhances the efficiency of the response. \n\nSomatic hypermutation, mediated by activation/induction-induced deaminase, amplifies the diversity of immunoglobulin genes by multiple mutations on the immunoglobin locus. Positive selection of antibody expressing B cells (and T cell differention recognizing the peptide of these antibodies) leads to the groups of specific antibodies we encounter during immune response. Affinity maturation works by clonal expansion of those few B cell clones which have the highest affinity to antigens during an ongoing immune response. B cells able to express antibodies with higher affinity to antigens prevail since they are more likely to receive survival/proliferational signals by intercellular interaction wit",
