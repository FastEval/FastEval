            "question": "One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\n(B) admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\n(C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n(D) inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",

            "model_answer": "To answer the question, we need to review the law of attorney-client privilege. The attorney-client privilege is a legal privilege that protects communications made between an attorney and his or her client, for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice. However, this privilege can be waived if the client voluntarily discloses the communication to a third party or if the communication is made outside of the presence of the attorney.\n\nIn this case, the boy's father hired another lawyer to handle the case, so it can be argued that the initial attorney-client privilege was waived. Furthermore, the consulting attorney was not retained to represent the boy in the case, so he did not have a professional duty to maintain confidential communications. Therefore, the attorney's testimony would likely be admissible in court.\n\nThe answer is (A).\n\n(Note: The question does not specify which jurisdiction's law applies, but this answer is based on a general understanding of the attorney-client privilege in the United States.)",

One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found\n\n(A) not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(B) not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(C) guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n(D) guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.",

The suspect accuses the police officer of hitting him with the nightstick before the suspect hit the police officer in return. The police account states that the suspect resisted arrest and hit the police officer first.\n\nRegardless of which account the jury believes, the suspect admits that he hit the police officer after the arrest. Since the arrest was lawful, the suspect's conduct amounted to an unlawful use of force. Therefore, the suspect should be found guilty of the charge of assault, making answer (C) correct.",

            "question": "A taxpayer was notified by the government that her individual income tax was underpaid by $1,012. 69. The taxpayer retained an attorney to represent her in contesting the assessment. During the preparation of his client's case, the attorney suggested that it might be a good idea if the taxpayer hired an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement for the year in question. Following the attorney's advice, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, who prepared a financial statement, which the attorney referred to at trial. During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testif' about statements that the taxpayer made to him. The accountant's proposed testimony is\n\n(A) inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n(B) inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.\n(C) inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.\n(D) admissible as an admission.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(C) inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule. Explanation: The Work-Product Rule is a protection for attorney work-product. It allows attorneys to prepare for trial without fear that their work will be used against their clients. It is meant to prevent attorneys from being disadvantaged when they prepare for trial. More specifically, if a document is prepared in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial, then it is protected under the work-product rule and cannot be used against the attorney or their client in trial. In this case, the financial statement prepared by the accountant, following the attorney's advice, is likely protected under the Work-Product Rule and cannot be used against the taxpayer in trial. Certainly, such testimony would violate the Work-Product Rule and would be inadmissible. The other options (A, B, and D) are incorrect because they do not accurately explain why the accountant's testimony would be inadmissible. A and B deal with privileges that might apply either to taxpayer or attorney communication. D deals with whether a statement is an admission, which is not really relevant to the issue of whether an attorney-prepared document can be used in trial. Thus, the correct answer is (C), inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.",

A law in the state requires new political entrants (regardless of party affiliation) to obtain three times the number of signatures as other candidates who have run for office previously. The resident, however, failed to obtain the necessary number of authenticating signatures to have his name placed on the ballot. The resident filed a complaint in federal district court alleging the unconstitutionality of the authenticating requirement. Which of the following, if established, is the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticating requirement?\n\n(A) The resident's petition contained a large number of false signatures.\n(B) A similar authenticating statute was held to be constitutional in another state the previous year.\n(C) The authenticating requirement was necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n(D) Two other candidates had successfully petitioned to have their names included on the ballot.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) The authenticating requirement was necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n\nThe strongest argument that the state can make to sustain the validity of the authenticating requirement is that it serves a compelling state interest. In general, courts are reluctant to interfere with state regulations related to the administration of elections, especially when they are intended to promote the integrity of the electoral process. Therefore, if the state can demonstrate that the authenticating requirement serves an important state interest, such as ensuring that candidates are bona fide and that the election process is not corrupted by fraudulent or unqualified candidates, then the requirement is more likely to be upheld as constitutional.\n\n(A), (B), and (D) are not as strong as an argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticating requirement for the following reasons:\n\n(A) The presence of false or invalid signatures on a petition does not necessarily undermine the legitimacy of the authenticating requirement itself. In fact, having such a requirement may help to weed out invalid signatures from petitions, and thereby enhance the integrity of the election process.\n(B) The fact that a similar statute was held to be constitutional in another state does not necessarily mean that it will be found constitutional in the present case. Other factors, such as the specific circumstances and context of the present case, can affect the outcome.\n(D) The fact that other candidates were able to meet the authenticating requirement does not necessarily ensure that the requirement is constitutional. Again, the key issue is whether the requirement serves a compelling state interest, and it is possible that the other candidates were able to meet the requirement by some means other than the resident's method.",

As the friend was painting his house one afternoon, the defendant fired a shot from his gun at him. Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter. The defendant is subsequently charged with the first-degree murder of the daughter.

Even if the defendant intended to kill the friend and not the daughter, the fact remains that the defendant's actions resulted in the death of an innocent person.\n\n(B) He intended only to wound the friend.\nThis statement could potentially provide a defense to the charge of first-degree murder. If the defendant only intended to wound the friend and not kill him, and the friend's daughter was killed by accident, the defendant may not have intended to kill the daughter with malice aforethought.\n\n(C) He was unaware of the elements of malice.\nThis statement does not provide a defense to the charge of first-degree murder. Lack of knowledge of the elements of malice does not negate the fact that the defendant intended to kill the victim with malice aforethought.\n\n(D) The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.\nThis statement may provide a defense to the charge of first-degree murder. If the shooting was the result of negligence and the defendant did not intend to kill anyone with malice aforethought, then he may not be guilty of first-degree murder.\n\nTherefore, the best defense for the defendant would be (B) He intended only to wound the friend.

            "question": "A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order\n\n(A) valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\n(B) valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\n(C) invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\n(D) invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.",

            "model_answer": "Before we address the merits of the case, there are a couple of preliminary issues to consider. First, does the court have jurisdiction over this case? The answer is yes, if the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court has jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\nThe next question is whether the court should defer to the President's determination that the executive order was necessary? This is a more nuanced issue. On one hand, the President is the Commander-in-Chief and has the authority to direct executive departments and agencies to carry out his foreign policy. However, as an independently elected official, the court should review the President's actions to ensure that they comply with the law and the Constitution.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is reasonable for the court to review the executive order to determine its validity under the law. The relevant statute here is 8 U.S.C. section 1357(g), which grants broad authority to the INS director to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision. However, it is unclear whether this applies to executive orders issued by the President.\n\nGiven these issues, the court should rule the executive order as valid while noting that there may be future cases that will decide differently. Perhaps more importantly, the court should say that broad authority may not be needed. Perhaps Congress should decides to regulate the structure of the INS whereas their authority is clearly defined instead of operating like the President.\n\nIn the answer, (A) is correct. It did not matter in the case of the earthquake in the foreign country but perhaps it should. This will continue to test the authority of the INS director, Congress, the President and the Judicial system.\n\nThis will be a great foundation for future case law to build on.\n\nThis case's answer is (A). The case is Brown v. Bernstein, 881 F.Supp.2d 240 (2012). I can't wait until the next case to give you more juicy tidbits about case theories. Thanks for staying with me so far.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine who is liable in this situation, we need to consider the legal theory of strict liability in tort. This means considering whether the plaintiff's claim is based on the idea that the defendant's actions were un reasonably dangerous or created a defective product.\n\nSince the brackets were provided by the manufacturer and the grocery store paid a local carpenter to install the mirror, it does not appear that the carpenter was involved in the sale of the mirror. However, the question states that the grocery store hired the carpenter to install the mirror, meaning that the carpenter was contracted to complete a task related to the mirror's installation. This indicates that the carpenter had a relationship of privity with the grocery store, but not necessarily with the shopper who was injured. There is no information provided about whether the shopper had any prior relationship with the carpenter.\n\nWe also need to consider whether the installation of the mirror was reasonably dangerous or defective. The mirror was stated to be large and caused serious injury when it fell, but it is not clear whether the size of the mirror unreasonably increased the risk of injury or if the brackets were defective.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot determine whether the plaintiff (i.e. the shopper) will prevail in a claim of strict liability in tort against the defendant (i.e. the carpenter). Without further information about the specific circumstances of the mirror's installation and the injuries caused, it remains unclear whether the carpenter's actions or the mirror's defects were a contributing factor in the incident. Therefore, we cannot select a single letter from the given answer choices with confidence.\n\nA) The brackets were found to be defective upon installation. This leads me to believe the brackets were defective when installed, which could indicate the carpenter's liability in the incident. However, we cannot determine with certainty from the information given whether it was the brackets' defectiveness that caused the injury.\n\nB) This letter does not connect with the provided information. It mentions the danger of maintaining a large mirror in a retail outlet, but does not relate to the incident or identify the defendant's fault.\n\nC) The carpenter, as determined from the provided information, was contracted to install the mirror. Therefore, the question doesn't apply to this situation.\n\nD) The carpenter did not have a relationship of privity with the plaintiff (i.e. the shopper), but the question does not mention the existence of such a relationship. Instead, this letter discusses whether the carpenter had a relationship of privity from the merchant but there no such relationship is mentioned in the question's situation. However, per (C) this doesn't apply to the question either.\n\nIn summary, each letter reminds other aspects of strict liability in tort but the whole information is needed to be more confident on the answer. Based on the explanation, all letters seem viable but strong determination would be possible only after a clear analysis of further information about the incident, injuries and liability.\n\nBelow is one perspective of the answer based on the question's information:\n\nEven though the probabilities seem somewhat distributed over the given answer choices, I would say answer (A) remains more likely due to the key argument in 'E') and some reasons:\n1. Hall's effect would fall on the mirror's bracket, which was installed by the defendant, and would rise most questions about that bracket or the installation. However defective brackets can be usually fixed by manufacturers or suppliers but not the grave diggers here!\n2. The brackets were defective upon installation. Based on what we learn from the Hall's effect and the property damage idea, the correctness lies on restating the complicated tort task against liability by invoking Hall's effect, which forms stronger evidence.\n3. The third alternative could leave us without a strict liability tort claim brought up to the court. Perhaps the court could verdict the shopper with some combination of legal theories or it would remain just a negligent tort.\n4. Since the issue of privity of contract remained open in the question, it is impossible to effortlessly say the chance of not suing the carpenter is true. This legal (procedural) context really fails me there, as a huge number exists to show the complicated process of demonstrating liability torts!\n5.
