            "model_answer": "The statement \"A\" best explains the purpose of Hart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation.' This is because Hart's distinction highlights the internal and external aspects of a rule, specifically focusing on the sociological aspect versus the psychological aspect. Hart's work in The Concept of Law highlights the importance of the internal aspect, or being obliged to follow a rule due to a sense of moral obligation, in addition to the external aspect of having an obligation to follow a rule because it is backed by a legal system or sanctions.\n\nAnswer: (A) It demonstrates the difference between the internal and the external aspect of a rule. (D) It illuminates the concept of a rule, (B) It refutes the natural lawyer's view of the role of morality in law, and (C) It explains the nature of power-conferring rules.)",

However, Maine did not necessarily mean this is as a prediction, but merely as an observation.\n\nB) Maine's concept of status might be misrepresented as being mere slavery, feudalism, or some other extreme form of hierarchy. However, this would be a mistake, as Maine saw status as including any traditional, non-contractual basis for determining legal relationships between people.\n\nC) Maine's statement might be taken literally to mean that all advances in human societies move from status to contract. However, this would be a mistake, as Maine acknowledged the possibility of turning back from one form to another (for example, the reemergence of slavery in Islamic countries).\n\nD) Maine's idea might be considered inapplicable to Western legal systems due to its emphasis on status and hierarchy. However, this would be a mistake, as Maine was careful to demonstrate the importance of status and hierarchy even in the most modern systems of law.\n\nThe correct answer is B), because Maine's concept of status might be misrepresented as being mere slavery, feudalism, or some other extreme form of hierarchy.\n\n(B, parenthesis)",

            "model_answer": "(C) the international recognition of human rights after World War II contributed significantly to the revival of natural law in the 20th century.\n\nNatural law is a legal theory that holds that there is a higher law or universal standard that binds everyone, including government officials and institutions. Throughout history, natural law has been used as a tool to promote certain values and principles such as human rights and dignity.\n\nAfter World War II, the international community recognized the need to protect human rights and established various institutions such as the United Nations and the International Court of Justice. As a result, the idea of natural law was revived and became an important tool in promoting and protecting human rights. Many legal scholars began to rely on natural law principles such as dignity, freedom, and equality to interpret and apply international law.\n\nMoreover, the recognition of human rights after World War II is significant because it highlighted the importance of protecting individuals from abuse and mistreatment by governments and other powerful actors. Many natural law theorists argue that natural law principles provide a framework for protecting individuals from such abuse.\n\nTherefore, (C) the international recognition of human rights after World War II contributed significantly to the revival of natural law in the 20th century.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(D) Judicial reasoning is always formal. This criticism is the most compelling because it highlights the weakness in Llewellyn's distinction. Specifically, it suggests that Llewellyn's grand style of legal reasoning does not actually exist in practice because all judicial decision-making is guided by formal legal principles. In this way, the grand style of legal reasoning is seen as misleading and superfluous. However, the formal style of legal reasoning is still necessary to ensure consistency and predictability in the law. Thus, the criticism is that Llewellyn's grand style is unnecessary, but his formal style is still relevant.\n\n(D)",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) By distinguishing certain features of the English legal system that facilitated the development of capitalism.\n\nWeber argued that the English legal system played a crucial role in the development of capitalism. One of the key features of the English legal system was the idea of \"abstract legal norms\" which were applied universally and fairly. This allowed for the creation of a legal framework which could be relied upon to enforce property rights, contracts, and other legal obligations. Additionally, the English common law provided a flexible system which was able to adapt and change over time in response to new social and economic developments. Both of these features helped to foster an environment in which capitalism could flourish. Weber argued that this unique combination of legal and economic institutions was not present in other societies, such as those following Roman legal traditions, and helped to explain why England was able to successfully develop capitalism while others were not. Therefore, he claimed that the 'England problem' could be solved by examining and understanding these specific features of the English legal system that facilitated capitalistdevelopment. \n  \nNote: This is a summary of Weber's arguments on the topic and should not be interpreted as a comprehensive defense of his views on the subject. This answer is based on information from the reading materials provided. While this may have been a useful model for a proposed colony, its value for an actual planet depends on a variety of factors that need quantitative analysis and testing. Therefore, this model types out Weber's solution to the England problem. The 'England problem' was the economic success of England compared to other countries at the same time. Therefore, Weber claimed that the 'England problem' could be solved by examining and understanding these specific features of the English legal system that facilitated capitalist development, while recognizing the importance of legitimate domination.",
