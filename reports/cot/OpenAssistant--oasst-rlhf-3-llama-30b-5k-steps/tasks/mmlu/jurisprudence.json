The revolution also paved the way for the development of critical legal studies, which critiqued the legal positivism that had dominated legal theory since the late 19th century. In response, legal scholars began to turn towards natural law as an alternative legal philosophy.\n\nWhile the Depression of the 1930s forced economists to re-evaluate their assumptions about the stability of the market, it did not have a significant impact on legal thought. The rise of Fascism in Europe led to a re-evaluation of legal institutions and philosophies, but it did not lead to a revival of natural law specifically.\n\nSimilarly, the international recognition of human rights after World War II was a significant moment for international law, but it did not contribute directly to the revival of natural law in legal theory.\n\nIn summary, the Bolshevik Revolution had the greatest impact on the revival of natural law in the 20th century. It forced legal scholars to question the dominant legal positivist approach and led them to turn towards natural law as an alternative philosophy.",

While this perspective can help us understand the evolution of the legal system and its consequences, it does not necessarily privilege the goal of promoting market efficiency in legal decision-making (answer (A)).\n\nD) Natural Law: This doctrine asserts that certain rights and principles are inherent and universal, which determines what the law should be.
