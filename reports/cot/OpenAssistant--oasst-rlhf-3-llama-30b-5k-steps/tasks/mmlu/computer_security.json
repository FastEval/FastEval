We also know that the server's certificate was validated by the client, and a Diffie-Hellman exchange was executed.\n\nHowever, since the client did not provide a client certificate, we can narrow down our options based on which attacks are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. A MITM attack is a type of attack where an attacker intercepts and modifies communication between two parties without either party realizing it. In this case, the attacker could potentially impersonate either the client or the server in order to intercept or modify communication.\n\nThus, we can conclude that TLS protects against attacks that are vulnerable to MITM, specifically:\n\n(A) An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier. \n(B) An attacker impersonating the server.\n\nSince (A) is vulnerable to MITM attacks, it is extremely likely that TLS protects against this.

In some cases, this can include a physical object, such as a computer or other electronic device, that generates and encodes messages using software or other computer-enabled technologies. Similarly, a modulator may be represented by a person or group of people who encode information for transmission, including visual or auditory signals such as sign language, verbal commands, or written notes. Other examples of a modulator may include an animal, such as a crow or primate, that has learned to encode information for the purpose of generating and transmitting signals employing visual, auditory, or olfactory modalities. Overall, any entity with the capability of encoding information into the form of a signal may fulfill the role of a modulator.\n\nDoes this fulfill your answer?

Programs written in languages like C and C++ are particularly prone to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, as these languages rely on the programmer to explicitly manage memory allocation and deal with pointers.\n\nPredefined functions in C and C++, such as ``strcpy()`` and ``strcat()``, do not perform string boundary checks, meaning that they do not verify that the source and destination buffers are not overlap. This leaves the door open for an attacker to inject crafted data into a buffer and cause a buffer overflow by manipulating the data in the buffer to write beyond its intended size and overwriting adjacent memory.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) No string boundary checks in predefined functions.",
