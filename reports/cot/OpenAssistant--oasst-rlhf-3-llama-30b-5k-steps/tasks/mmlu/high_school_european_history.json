            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following memoir.\nNot only did he expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree; at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Here is my step-by-step response to your question:\n\nThe duke, as a member of the French nobility, would certainly have had a bias when it came to the French monarchy, particularly King Louis XIV. The document you provided describes how King Louis would take note of absences at court and expected the attendance of all people of distinction. It would certainly have been important for the duke to stay in the King's favor, as being out of favor or disobeying would have led to severe penalties or even being sent to prison or being executed.\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\nSympathy is a positive emotion, but it may not be the correct term to use when describing the bias of a member of the French nobility towards King Louis XIV. While the nobility supported King Louis, they would certainly have had a vested interested in remaining in his favor and avoiding penalties. Therefore, the duke may be biased towards King Louis due to the potential consequences of disobeying or being out of favor, but not necessarily due to sympathy towards him.\n\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\nWhile King Louis XIV did limit the power of the nobility, it would not necessarily mean that the duke would be biased against him. The duke would have wanted to maintain relationships with King Louis to remain in his favor, and not get into trouble. Therefore, while King Louis did have a significant impact on the power of the nobility, this answer is also not completely correct. Therefore, I am unable to output the answer at this time.\n\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\nThe document does not support the idea that the duke would be in favor of the extension of control over the French population by the state. The duke is concerned with how King Louis XIV manages the court and rewards and punishes those who remain in or are out of his favor. The duke may have been in favor of preserving the traditional power and privileges of the nobility.\n\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.\nThe document provides support for answer (D). The duke supports King Louis XIV's preservation of the social position of the aristocracy, while acknowledging that their power was removed. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the document would be (D).\n\nIn general, bias arises when there is a prejudice based on a conf lict of interest and financial or other gains are at stake. Since the duke was a member of the French nobility, he would certainly have had a vested interest in maintaining favor with King Louis XIV and avoiding penalties. Therefore, the duke may be biased towards King Louis due to the potential consequences of disobeying or being out of favor, but not necessarily due to sympathy towards him.\n\nTherefore, answer (D) would be the best explanation of the bias found in the document. If there is anything else I can help you with, or if you'd like to ask me a different question, don't hesitate to let me know!\n output: D",

The passage describes the disappointment of Souvarine, a character who had hoped to see the foundation of a new society of labor in common, as he has become disillusioned with the idea of national liberation as an end goal. The rest of the passage highlights the idea that the working-class is not willing to give back its wealth and property out of a sense of noblesse oblige, which marks the contrast between the generosity of the aristocracy earlier in the day and the new capitalists who focus only on their own advancement.\n\nA historian looking at this passage from a 19th-century Russian perspective would likely be interested in the idea of class struggle and the idea of noblesse oblige, as both were relevant social issues of the time. Additionally, the idea of the nobility as generous highlights the conflict between traditional and modern ways of living, which also interested 19th-century Russian writers like Tolstoy.",

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.

He believed that their enslavement was morally wrong and that the treatment of the natives amounted to genocide.\n* Columbus, on the other hand, was an explorer who played a significant role in the colonization of the New World. He saw the natives as subordinate and described them as willing to trade their valuable goods like cotton and gold for nothing more than fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars.

He believed that the Spaniards' ultimate goal was to acquire gold and rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n* Columbus, on the other hand, wanted to create a positive impression of his actions.
