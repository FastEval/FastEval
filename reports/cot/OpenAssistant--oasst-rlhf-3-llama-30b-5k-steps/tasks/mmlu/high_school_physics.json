            "model_answer": "1. To start, let's first understand what is meant by the term \"inverse square of distance.\"\n2. We can recall that the metric for the inverse square rule for a given quantity is `1/ r^2`, where `r` is the distance between the source and the point where the field is observed.\n3. This means that the further away the observer is from the source of the field, the lower the magnitude of the field will be.\n4. After considering the metric for the inverse square rule, let's review the options given.\n5. We can exclude option D, as the magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire does not follow the inverse square rule.\n6. Option C is the electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge. We know that this field follows the inverse square rule metric.\n7. Option A is the electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod and option B is the electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder.\n8. Since the latter two options refer to charges that are not infinite in size, we know that as the distance from the charged object increases, the field strength produced by these objects will not follow the inverse square rule.\n9.

            "model_answer": "(D) Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\n\nAs the tension in the string increases, the wave speed decreases, and as the wave speed decreases, the frequency (f= v/ wavelength remains the same, so the wavelength increases. Therefore, the wavelength of the new standing waves will be greater than the wavelength of the original standing waves. The reason of above answer is that the correct equation that relates the wave speed, tension, and wavelength is wave speed (v) proportional to the square root of (tension/wavelength), which leads the wave speed to be inversely proportional to the square root of the wavelength. Hence as we increase tension, wave speed will decrease and the wavelength is getting bigger. This is a classical reason of standing waves in strings.\n Standing waves are produced by a 100-Hz generator in a string of fixed length.

Since the capacitance is given as 10 \u00b5F (microfarads) and we need to convert it to Farads: 1 \u00b5F = 10^-6 Farads. Therefore, 10 \u00b5F = (10^-6) * (10)^6 = 10^-4 Farads.\n3.
