            "model_answer": "(D) State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed.\n\nThe establishment clause and the free-exercise clause are two key clauses in the First Amendment of the US Constitution that address the issue of religion and government.\n\nThe establishment clause states that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" This implies that the government cannot establish or favor any particular religion.\nThe free-exercise clause states that \"Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" This implies that the government cannot interfere with an individual's right to practice the religion of their choice.\n\nIn its rulings and decisions, the Supreme Court has tried to strike a balance between these two clauses. One of the most significant decisions was in the case of Engle v. Vitale. In this case, the Court ruled that public schools could not officially compose a prayer that a teacher would lead the class in reciting at the start of each day.\n\nHowever, in cases such as Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, the Court ruled that student-led prayer at a football game prior to the game was permissible, as long as the students are not encouraged or compelled to participate in the prayer by school officials, and no one is encouraged or compelled to participate in or refrain from participation in the prayer against his or her will.\n\nOverall, the Supreme Court has tried to maintain the idea that the government should not endorse or favor any particular religion, while still protecting the right of individuals to practice the religion.\n\nThrough a series of rulings, the Courts has achieved an.balance between the two , a cumulative result of Supreme Court precedents on the subject- The result is a legal framework for dealing with Establishment clause issues (state sponsored religious expression) that permits certain government acknowledgments of religion over.others. and some , but cumulatively very limited, religious expression by students. The framework is most often associated withGTeach.School District and Santa , Fe Independent School District v.J;oel-\nIt generally allows individual or group voluntary prayer.
