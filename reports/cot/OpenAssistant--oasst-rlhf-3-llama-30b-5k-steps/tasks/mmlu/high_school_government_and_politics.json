            "question": "Which of the following plays the most significant role in forming a child's political views?\n\n(A) The geographical area in which the child grows up\n(B) The child's family\n(C) The media to which the child is exposed\n(D) The child's religion",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer to this question is likely to be multifaceted, and dependent on a number of variables. For example, the influence of a child's family on their political views can be influenced by the area in which the child grows up, such as the social or economic conditions of the local area. It might depend also on the discussion and exposure to politics within the family household, although e.g. growing up in an urban area with fewer incidents of unemployment than a rural area might influence the child's views, via discussions around the dinner table, without the parents intending to elicit a political view.\n\nIf the exposure to the media, or more generally news (this option is overly broad, as children might primarily consume non-political material), is also taken into account, then options B,C and D are the most significant sources of political views. The family has exchanged the primary role it once had on influencing the child, on what should be considered more objectiable truths, with that of news sources. These sources of information vary greatly, and it could be argued that personal choice itself, whild gleaning important skills from family upbringing, is now itself a vast transmitor of political views. With the rise of the internet and social media, groups and people of intended political views may \"follow, subscribe or friend\" sources from outside of their local area thus bringing about influence. A friend of mine was a raving britian first supporter, following its leader quite closely, which caused an upset in his group of friends. From then on,  he became much more distant from his friends on political issues. His \"schema\" about where to find polictically like minded people, using the trait of \"Schmema\" introduced in dialogical empiricism and not to used in empiricism in general, was enhanced greatly from one discussion. Based on this, the media most influences one's political views. However, I would still say also due to the social backlash from his friends not sharing British us first views was also likely to influence this change of view via opinion of the self's.\n\nFinally, consideration should be taken into account that it is not those traditionally taught to be the holders of political influence, that actually have any real significance over a childs formation, and that power off a parents word, is the indirect path taken between Option B and Option D, in which those ationg a child has most contact with in its early years, should not be removed their status.\n\nThe most likely development in a comprehensive theory is that the answer to this question would be A-D, as each of these answers are joined via paths of influence one to another, with the areas of effect expanding with each link. To settle these theories, survey research would need to intoduce a control group that corrolates some of the predicate polic vies with the relevant environmental variable chosen within the survey.\n\nThe answer can be found in a few places however, and is far from a compact or inter acknowledged theory, and there are many sources missing:\n1.  Recent vicriva surveys of other empirical material on the topic has led authors to safely assume this answer witha certain magnitute of certainty,  however there is evidence that contradicts this in some cases.\n2.  A study of 20 something year olds on effect of political discussions with family in forming political vies goes withing them, contradicts the idea that these discussions only have a short term effect.\n3. There could also be an invidious role due to geo location, such as an argumenative two compatable people would hold differently due to which part of the country they come from due differen positions in Enlgand, such as a Yorkshire pudding vs a Battered Breaded Chip in Batter, in exported cultural patterns, etc. Which are a result of where the food item has been placed within the ambient cultural climate, as opposed to being a cause of it. There might very well be some combinations of culture which might cause one individual to be interested in foreign affairs, while another to be more interested in taxation, even though their policies as laid out by their parties of choice fo not differ on these issues. \nSo, summarising the answer is \"A B C and D\". \n\nI could not find any caveats showing the philosophical underpinnings of his view. The logcal conclusion, bettter put, the foThis answer is inequitative, misses out many extraneous influencers, such as genuine poltiical inclinations of higher authority public figures, and the changing views in culture.\n```.\n\n(E) A, (the answer lies within the choices given)\n(E",

However, it is neither constitutional nor legal under the federal constitutions.\nSince (A), (B), and (C) are all baseless, the correct answer is (E).",
