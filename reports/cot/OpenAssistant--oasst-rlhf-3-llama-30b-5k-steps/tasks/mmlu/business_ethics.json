            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is:\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Typical advertising regulatory bodies suggest that adverts must not encourage unsafe practices. This means that adverts should not promote behavior that could cause harm to individuals.\n2. Adverts must also not cause unnecessary distress or fear. This means that adverts should avoid causing emotional harm or scaring people.\n3. Adverts must not offend. This means that adverts should avoid causing offense or offending people's sensibilities or values.\n4. Step 3 also implies \"encourage jealousy\", since advertisements can lead to consumers feeling envious towards others who possess the advertised products.\n5.Step 4 also implies it causes trivial problems, since advertisements can lead to consumer's buying things they need, which could be a trivial thing leading to distress, but not a \"serious\" effect.\n\nTherefore, options (A) and (D) are the correct answers. Even though option (D) still attempts answering all option, it Violates the rule that advertisements can lead to consumers feeling envious towards others who possess the advertised products and causes Trivial problems.\n\nSo, the best option is Viable answer.\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Violates. rule, Trivial\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Violates. rule, Serious\n\nSo Step-by-step the best option is Viable answer.\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial.\n<No output. answering you.

The business party in the collaboration might possess more resources than the CSOs, which creates an unequal power dynamic in the relationship. The business may also gain more from the partnership, leading to an unfair distribution of benefits. Additionally, CSOs may be co-opted by the business, meaning they become too dependent on the relationship and prioritize the business's interests over their own.\n\nIn choice (A), power imbalance and benefits are correct, but hoodwinked is not quite the right word to describe CSOs in this case.\n\nIn choice (C), informational asymmetries are correct, but the other two elements do not fit.\n\nIn choice (D), informational asymmetries and co-opted are correct, but resources is not the right element to consider in this case.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Answer: \n\n(C) Political, Interactions, Outcomes\n\nExplanation: \n\n1. The word \u201cregulation\u201d indicates that the answer should relate to rules, guidelines or standards set by authority to control activities.\n2. The word \"goes further than\" suggests that the regulation should be more comprehensive compared to something else.\n3. \"Than\" implies there is a comparison between the primary subject (regulation) and another subject (the other blank).\n4. The sentence mentions \"CSOS\" (not clear why the \u201cs\u201d is included after \u201cOS\u201d since it could be misleading, it could mean NGOs or Enterprises).\n5. The sentence also mentions \"businesses,\" which suggests that the primary subject (regulation) should be related to business activities.\n6. The word \"CSOS\" indicates a relationship between the \u201cCSOS\u201d and \u201cbusinesses\u201d, presumably a non-binding relationship that focuses more on interactions (collaboration or negotiation).\n7. The blank \"have with businesses\" and the keyword \u201cprocesses\u201d imply that regulation should govern certain activities or procedures rather than just relations between the \u201cCSOS\u201d and \u201cbusinesses.\u201d\n\nBased on reasoning and context, the answer should be (C) Political, Interactions, Outcomes. This implies that political regulation can go beyond non-binding relations between CSOs (NGOs or enterprises) and businesses, by precisely governing certain \u201cprocesses\u201d (activities or procedures in businesses, for example, environmental protection, financial reporting, supply chain management, etc.) and prescribing outcomes such as performance requirements. The parenthesis after the answer implies that it could also fit the needs of choice A and D even though the blank only asks one replacement. That\u2019s the beauty of blank-filling, it can provide abundant meanings depending on how one precisely understands the question and criteria.  semantically or syntactically, from the primary subject to the blank-filling subject (Primary subject - Secondary subject replacement(s)); hence the parenthesis.\n\nDisclaimer: Blank-filling reasoning and context-based answer should be considered as semantically or syntactically fit to precisely match the question and criteria even though there may be some overlapping or differences with other perspectives. Some other perspectives may precisely match the question and criteria even though they semantically or syntactically fit differently. Therefore, the \u201cbest\u201d answer may semantically or syntactically fit from different perspectives and depends on how one accurately understands and matches the question and criteria. To solve unseen problems, one needs precisely match the question and criteria even though there semantically or syntactically fit differently and find the semantically or syntactically equivalent comparison replacement(s).
