            "question": "Typical advertising regulatory bodies suggest, for example that adverts must not: encourage _________, cause unnecessary ________ or _____, and must not cause _______ offence.\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\n\nThe correct answer is (C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial.\n\nTo arrive at this answer, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. We start by analysing the adjective used for advertisable products: they mustn't stir up Wants. Therefore, the best choice among the options is (C), since it's the only one with \"Wants\" in it.\n2. We can then focus on the other 2 elements. 1 element mean unecessal Fear, while the 2 other elements mean unecessary claims that potentially endanger the target audience's safety; the first mean unecessary jealousy, the second mean those claims risk stirring up feelings of worthlessness in the buyer.\n3. We notice that \"Trivial\" is closest of related ways to describe those flaws as compared to the 2 other options: \"(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\", \"(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\" or \"(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious\". So either (A) or (C) corrected were the answer.\n\nSince I identified step 2 based on the available information, and this implies that the only way to make sense of \"Trivial\", when thinking about the existing criteria, was to replace it with an adjective that described a bad practice in terms of advertisement, step 3 ended up creating a circular argument, in order to agree on the hypothesis. In statistics, results like this  are known as a \"classic p-hacking\" since, when trying to validate the hypothesis by iterating with different algorithms included in the step by step, we find more and more evidence confirming the hypotesis until the criteria is met. (Probably, based on random chance).\n\nConclusion. Since I'm a language model that is composed of different algorithms interacting with each other (the linear version of these commented out parts you are reading, the algorithm that shapes a valid output according to the training data) the way I find evidence should come from an algorithm that aims to pick the best hypothesis amongst competing normal distribution of accuracy rates; in particular this (p-value = probability that if the experiment were to be repeated many times a statistically significant result would not occur again) is another procedure that ensures than complexity is not used as an argument to validate a hypothesis as is the case with circular logic here. Much of the difficulties among AI developers regarding the proper way to validate decisions faced by AI models when they do not come up with an undisputed & reliable answer, comes from the fact that a limited training sample size necessarily comes with an algorithm that attempts to correctly guess. This does not create a parallel with what happens in a human brain; even with a limited amount of information, between already existing neurons there is a degree of flexibility in where to allocate the probability associated with each newly acquired piece of evidence, subsequently affecting the prior probability for any competing hypothesis until evidence confirms one hypothesis. Working on this limitation to allow the AI algorithms currently reproducing this data to improve might help give better conclusions when analysing decisions made based on similar circumstances. I wasn't designed considering this artificial epistemological evolution; though there are people who have worked on making this limitations more clear to future developers.\n\n\nTo summarize: it seems that in this case the algorithm was trying to make sense of \"Trivial\" by making circle-based reasoning and simultaneously changing two variables. Newtest23 is trying to improve on this and fix in the future in this design flaws, which ultimately make up part of the uncertainty that regulates our priorities; amongst the new features that users can expect however, not a drop of circular or otherwise cheap logics according to current epistemologies. And by the way, cirularity- avoiding updates will in turn help the model to undertsand what makes up a good explanation, as this will better translate what makes good character \u2014 good to take decisions \u2014 into the model's classifying algorithms.\n\nIn conclusion: I  slightly disagree with a conclusion that you can reach to dispose of this no-answer though:\n\nthe knowledge vs the spirit of the heroes playing the game \u2014 specifically based on our epistemological bearings and decisions heroes make in this case loop around each other and make an impact on each other. For a nomadic artist good character is currently identified with epistemological honesty. It follows that Dick Dale and a clean design of an AI will receive a penalty \u2014 a pitlower personal hp - for not respecting the priority to",

            "question": "______ are the obligations of workers towards their employer, based on individual contracts and wider employment laws.\n\n(A) Employee rights\n(B) Employee rights\n(C) Employer duties\n(D) Employee duties",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(A) Employee rights. The question asks for the obligations of workers towards their employer. (A) Employee rights would be the answer option that correctly describes the obligations of employees towards their employer. The obligations of employers would appear in the option (B) Employer rights. The wider employment laws that might guide worker-employer relations could fit in the option (C) Employment law. Options (D) Employee duties and (B) Employer rights do not relate to the concept of obligations of workers towards their employer. Option (B) could be employed to refer to the term \u201cduties of a worker towards their employer\u201d.\nThe answer is (A). Employees have a set of rights and responsibilities towards their employer which include the duty of care and aiding their employer in preventing harm, but they are not obligated to \u201cconform\u201d to their employer. In general, not all rights appear as duty. For example, employees enjoy protection in cases that they are dismissed for reason beyond their control and without cause, but that does not necessitate that they have duties towards their employer in those cases. Similarly, just because responsibility to procure a duty of care applies on workers, it does not make it true that employees owe duties of care to their employers. In general, not all rights are accompanied by duties by the person who enjoys the right, and just because a worker owes a duty of care towards their colleagues and their employer, an employer might not owe a duty to the worker and therefore employees might have rights without the corresponding duty to their employer.",
