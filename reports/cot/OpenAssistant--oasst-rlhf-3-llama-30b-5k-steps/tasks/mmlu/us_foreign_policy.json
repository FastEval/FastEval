            "model_answer": "(A)\n\nThe United Nations Security Council is a body within the United Nations that is responsible for maintaining peace and security in the international community. The Security Council is composed of 15 member countries, which are selected by the General Assembly of the United Nations according to a specific distribution of seats.\n\nThe United States, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom are the permanent members of the Security Council. These countries are granted a permanent seat on the Security Council due to their status as the victors of World War II and are also referred to as the P-5.\n\nThe other 10 member countries are elected for two-year terms, with five member countries elected each year. These countries are referred to as the non-permanent members. Unlike the permanent members, who have the power of veto over any decisions made by the Security Council, the non-permanent members do not have this power.\n\nTherefore, the structure of the United Nations Security Council is composed of five permanent members with veto power (the P-5) and 10 rotating members without veto power (the non-permanent members).\n\nThe answer is therefore option (A).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed by the US Congress in response to the Gulf of Tonkin incidents in August 1964. The resolution authorized the President to use military force in Vietnam to defend US interests and provided the legal basis for US escalation in the Vietnam War. This resolution allowed the Johnson administration to increase US involvement in the Vietnam War by expanding the use of military force and deploying additional troops to Vietnam without a formal declaration of war by Congress.\n\n(D) curtailed US involvement in Vietnam is incorrect. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution actually authorized escalated US military involvement in Vietnam and led to greater US involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nThe Gulf of Tonkin resolution(A) allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam,illustrated the influence of public opinion on US foreign policy(B) and enhanced(C) Congressional control over the Vietnam War(D) curtailed US involvement in Vietnam is incorrect. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution actually authorized escalated US military involvement in Vietnam and led to greater US involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nI would choose (A) for its significance because the resolution allowed increased military action.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(B) cutting conventional arms in Europe.\n\nThe Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) of 1987 was the first major accord between the Soviet Union and the United States of America that focused on the reduction of nuclear weapons stockpiles between the two nations. It was the first treaty that set limits on the number of deployed nuclear weapons sanctioned by both the U.S. Congress and the Supreme Soviet.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the U.S. and the Soviet Union had been looking to reduce their arsenals of nuclear weapons that had reached massive highs during the Cold War, with a mutual desire to reduce the risks associated with their stockpiles. On April 15 of 1982, General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev sent a note to President Ronald Regan that set out the schedule for arms-control negations, with a set of three \"zero options\" set to be discussed \u2013 a \"zero option,\" a notion that neither side would remove or consume existing nuclear arms, a \"15% reduction option,\" which would cover land-based missiles only; and a \"50% reduction option,\" which would cover all nuclear arms. The Ronald Regan administration decided that a preparatory dialogue on the issues of verification, the Title VIII of the 1982 Central Intelligence Act that set up the U.S. Intelligence Community\u2019s Counter-Proliferation Center to track the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, scientific cooperation that could function as a form of \" Track II diplomacy,\" cooperative monitoring where U.S. experts monitored Soviet military units, cooperative confidence-building measures, the \"demilitarization\" of space, and cooperative measures for peace keeping and arms control in Outer Space and the International Seabed.\n\nNegotiations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the successor to SALT II collapsed in 1980, but a series of high-level meetings between Reagan and new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev from 1985 were focused on how to ease the tensions that had arisen from the policies of their respective predecessors. Gorbachev became head of the Soviet Union in March of 1985, and the schedule for arms-control negations came to a head, when Gorbachev visited the U.S. on December 7th. Before the announcement of a summit meeting in October 1986, Gorbachev released a three-part proposal for U.S.-Soviet relations over the forthcoming period where all arms would be subject to \"reduction and refreshment.\" On the 21st of October, Reagan and Gorbachev agreed at a summit in Reykjavik, Iceland to the broad framework that would eventually become the INF Treaty.\n\nThe Strategic Arms Reduction Talks would continue into the 1990s, but the INF Treaty would be the first major treaty between the two countries. Thus, the answer is (B) cutting conventional arms in Europe.",

The early 2000s saw a rise in skepticism towards international intervention and organizations such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. This skepticism can be seen as a form of neo-isolationism, which prioritizes national interests over international cooperation.\n* (B) internationalist sentiment is an opposite political attitude, prioritizing international cooperation and intervention. While this political attitude was also present during this time, it was not typically associated with the \"New Populism.\"\n* (C) expression of American cultural superiority is another political attitude that was associated with the \"New Populism.\" The early 2000s saw a trend in American politics towards emphasizing national sovereignty and cultural identity. This sometimes translated into a sense of cultural superiority, the belief that American culture is superior to other cultures.\n* (D) increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making is a political attitude that was also associated with the \"New Populism.\" The early 2000s saw a rise in the influence of public opinion on foreign policy, as political leaders sought to bridge the gap between the elite and the general public. This political attitude can be seen as a form of anti-elite sentiment, which prioritizes the views of the general public over the views of political elites.\n\nIn summary, the \"New Populism\" was a complex political phenomenon, and can perhaps be best described as comprising rhetoric aro",
