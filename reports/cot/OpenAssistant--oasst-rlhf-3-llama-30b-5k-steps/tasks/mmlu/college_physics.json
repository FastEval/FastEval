            "model_answer": "The light incident on the oil layer on the puddle surface is reflected due to the difference in refractive indices between the oil and water. We can use the law of reflection and Snell's law to solve this problem.\n\nWe know that the incident light is normally incident, so the angle of incidence (\u03b81) is equal to 90 degrees. The refractive index of water is 1.33, and that of oil is 1.5.\n\nLet's use Snell's law to find the angle of reflections:\n\nn1 * sin(\u03b81) = n2 * sin(\u03b82)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of water (1.33), \u03b81 is the angle of incidence (90 degrees), and n2 is the refractive index of oil (1.5).\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n1.33 * sin(90 degrees) = 1.5 * sin(\u03b82)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find the angle of reflection as 83.08 degrees.\n\nNow we can figure out which wavelength is strongly reflected. White light has all the colors of the visible spectrum. Assuming the light source has a continuous range of wavelengths, the reflected spectrum would have all the colors as well. However, for strong reflection, we need a minimum difference in refractive indices between the two media. As the angle of incidence increases, this difference increases, and the reflected light becomes more strongly reflected at certain wavelengths.\n\nWe are looking for the most strongly reflected wavelength. At this point, we do not need to have a specific wavelength in mind - just an understanding of how the relation between the refractive indices and wavelengths works.\n\nFor a higher or lower refractive index of the oil layer surface with respect to the water, light would be either absorbed or transmitted, with minimal reflection. Therefore, ignoring absorption, the strongest reflection would occur where the refractive indices of the oil surface and water differ the most, which would be in the shorter-wavelength part of the spectrum.\n\nSince the oil has a higher refractive index than water, the most strongly reflected wavelength would be among the shorter-wavelength part of th",

            "model_answer": "(C) The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.\n\nThis is true for a reversible thermodynamic process. During this process, the system undergoes a change in its internal energy and temperature, but the entropy of the system and its environment does not change. This is because, in a reversible thermodynamic process, heat is transferred between the system and the environment in a way that minimizes entropy changes, resulting in constant entropy for the combined system and environment. (C) is the correct answer.\n\nPlease note that irreversible thermodynamic processes result in an increase in entropy for the combined system and environment.

If the changes in both are infinitesimally small, \u0394S will be close to zero and thus the entropy of the system and medium will remain close their starting values, between \u0394S is always positive.

When the second and third capacitors are connected, the capacitors will share the voltage difference between them. The equivalent capacitance of the three capacitors in series can be calculated as follows:\n\nC_equivalent = C_1 + (2 * C_2)\n\nSince all the capacitors are identical, they have the same capacitance value, which we can represent as C.
