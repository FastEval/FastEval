            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\n\n* The quantum efficiency of a photon detector is 0.1, meaning that only 10% of the photons incident on the detector will be detected.\n* If 100 photons are sent into the detector, one after the other, the detector will only detect 0.1*100=10 of the photons.\n* The probability that the detector will detect a photon is independent of whether the detector has already detected a photon in a given session. Therefore, the detector will detect a photon 10 times on average, with an equal probability of detecting 0, 1, 2, or 3 photons in each session.\n* The rms (root mean square) deviation is a measure of the spread of the distribution of the number of photons detected in a given session. The square root of the average of the square of the number of photons detected in a given session minus the square of the average of the number of photons detected in a given session is 1, which is the square of 1. Therefore, the rms deviation of the number of photons detected in a given session is 1.\n* The rms deviation of the number of photons detected in 10 sessions, which means that the number of photons detected in 10 sessions can vary by up to 1, is the square root of 10, which is approximately 3.16. Therefore, the rms deviation of the number of photons detected in 10 sessions is about 3.16, not 3. The available choices all have rms deviations of approximately 1, so none of them are correct.\n* The answer is (D), with rms deviation of about 0.1, which matches none of the available choices. Answer: (D)\n\nNote that this question is based on probability, and the actual number of detection events may vary based on luck. The answer provided is based on the statistical analysis of the possible outcomes. The answer would be the same even if 1 million photons were send in, and the RMS deviation would still be approximately 3.16, if the quantum efficiency is 0.1. They only send 100 photons to simplify the equation and make it easier to calculate. Just to point out tha...",

Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\n\n(A) 500 nm\n(B) 550 nm\n(C) 600 nm\n(D) 650 nm",

            "model_answer": "The reflection of light from a surface occurs because the velocity of light changes as it enters a material. At a boundary between two materials, the light bends\n(A) toward the normal if the first material has the smaller index of refraction\n(B) toward the normal if the second material has the smaller index of refraction\n(C) away from the normal, say, into empty space\n(D) toward the surface boundary itself\nThe answer can be found by using Snell's Law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of Refraction is equal to the ratio of the velocity of light in the second medium to the velocity of light in the first medium.\n\nSince White light contains all colors as we know from Newton, the shortest wavelength that is part of white light is ~400 nanometer controversial (btw.) the longest should be somewhere around 700-750 nanometer.\n\nTo find the color with the shortest wavelength that will be most strongly reflected we have to find a angle satisfying the law of Snell. Law for which we may apply normals to the water (n1=1.33) and the oil layer (n2=1.5). Solving this equation for A we get a angle of ~18.4\u00b0\n\nBut the critical angle however is in our case the first angle where the reflected wave will experience total reflection because the reflected wave has to travel from the oil layer into the water and then directly back into the oil layer, i.e. the reflected wave has to changecourse twice. This happen if the angle of incidence is ~48.6274 \u00b0 wich corresponds to a wavelength of 400 nanometers.\n\nHowever by an using a multi-layer coating or oil designed to match a color with it's Bragg-Wavelength other colors can be reflected more than blue or violet. In fact the color you will see of a oil covered puddle is independent of it's really color but rather the color that get's absorbed and reflected. In other words it depends on how much of the light used gets reflected. But that this is over the range that our human eye can \"see\". ... Actually make that three, because the short wavelenghtest colors of light still exist, even if wehny only perceive a color that doesn't contain them. So in many cases we quickly switch to other colors once the lowest energy containing frequency band is absorbed. In other words: There is no such thing as a black color ;-) ...\n\nIn summary: (D) 650 nm looks likely only regarding color-subjective perception but actually it's more like (A) 500 nm.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(B) The temperature of the system remains constant during the process.\nThe application of entropy is that energy is not available to do work in any step in the process in which heat turns into work, and this is true of reversible processes. Since energy must still flow out of the system in a reversible process (or into the system, if it were reversed in time) the temperature remains the same. Because of this, the entropy change needs to be defined in terms of heat and temperature changes in the system (and its surroundings), and no other properties seem useful in that application. This invariance of temperature with a reversible process, then, is the key lynchpin of all thermodynamics. The first law states that energy is conserved in processes. The second low states that in addition to conservation of energy, one can also always tell how much energy will be \"left over for work\" at a specific temperature, regardless of how many steps each process takes. And the third law allows drawing as negative a sign in front of some quantities describing a system as we need, based on how many ways we want to do things. Al most any property can proceed reversibly as long as the other dependent variables (e.g. temperature and number of particles) are defined suitably. (In other words, the monotonically increasing \"Arrow of Time\" is a result of energy availability. We humans tend to prefer processes involving a net production of entropy, which maximizes the flow of entropy with energy that can do work, which itself seems pretty suggestive.)\n(A) There are no changes in the internal energy of the system.\nThis statement is not always true of a system that undergoes a reversible thermodynamic process. A reversible process means simply that the infinitesimal steps the system undergoes in the process can all be \"undone,\" so to speak. That is, the system can always be taken back to any of its previous states along a reversible path.

            "model_answer": "(C) 3/2\n\nThe reasoning behind this choice is as follows:\n\nThe electron configuration in the ground state of neutral nitrogen (Z=7) is 1s22s22p3. In this configuration, each 1s, 2s, and two 2p electrons contribute to the total spin quantum number.\n\nFirst, let's look at the 1s electrons. Since there are two of them, they both contribute a spin quantum number of 1/2.\n\nNext, there are two 2p electrons. The 2p orbital runs parallel to the z-axis, so if you draw it in space, it looks like two cones. Each contains one electron, and because they share the same orbital symmetry, they both contribute the same spin quantum number. However, the 2p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number of 1. This means that the total spin quantum number of the two 2p electrons is given by their angular momentum quantum number multiplied by \u2154. 1 x \u2154 = \u2154.\n\nFinally, there are two 2s electrons. The 2s orbital runs around the z-axis, and again, these electrons both contribute the same spin quantum number. However, the 2s orbital has an angular momentum quantum number of 0. This means that the total spin quantum number of the two 2s electrons is given by their orbital angular momentum quantum number multiplied by \u2154. 0 x \u2154 = 0.\n\nNow we simply add up the total spin quantum numbers of all the electrons to obtain the total spin quantum number of the nitrogen atom.\n\n1/2 for each 1s electron + \u2154 for both 2p electrons + 0 for both 2s electrons = 1/2 + \u2154 + 0 = 4/2.\nThis gives us a total spin quantum number of 2, as an integer, and since we don't have an option for this answer, we choose (C) 3/2 as the closest answer.\n(C) 3/2",
