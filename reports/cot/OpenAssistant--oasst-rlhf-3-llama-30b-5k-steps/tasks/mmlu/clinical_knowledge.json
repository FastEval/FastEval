However, a larger bore size still has a wider opening allowing for faster infusion.\n\nSmaller cannulas (C and D) are typically used in pediatrics and infants due to their smaller vessels and reduced blood volume, as well as the risk of complications from a rapid infusion.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I would choose option A (18 gauge).\n\nThe size of the cannula for a rapid blood transfusion in a patient would generally be an 18 gauge (A).",
