            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A).\n\nHere is my reasoning:\n\n1. In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court case San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez declared that the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not require that education be free or equal for all students in the United States. This decision meant that states were not required to fund education equitably or fairly, allowing them to fund education as they saw fit. After the Rodriguez decision, there were still many state constitutional decisions that required states to provide at least free public education to all, regardless of the state's system of taxation.\n2. In 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court decided the case San Antonio School District v. Hall, which held that the U.S. Constitution requires states to provide a public education system that is at least substantially equal for all students in the state.\n3. In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court decided the case Larry P. v. Riles, in which a single justice held that education is a fundamental, rather than a merely instrumental right. Although federal right-to-education statutes do not usually use the term \"fundamental right,\" they, nonetheless, uniformly declare that all children--regardless of race, sex, or national origin--have a right to an equal educational opportunity. Thus, Larry P. v. Riles built a direct confrontation with right-to-education statutes on the face of single-sex schooling.\n4. Subsequently, the California State Constitution was amended to prohibit the denial of education benefits to students based on gender.\n5. In light of the above statements and reasoning, I am confident that the answer is (A).\n\nThe answer, as stated earlier, is (A). The precedent established in Larry P. v. Riles resulted in the provision of a free, appropriate public education for students with disabilities in California.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "This question is asking about the concept of heritability, which refers to the degree to which differences in a trait are due to genetic differences between individuals. The heritability of a trait increases as the differences in the trait among individuals become more genetically determined and less influenced by environmental factors.\n\nSo let's consider each option:\n\n(A) 0%: This option states that the heritability of a trait in a cloned population is 0%. This is not possible because heritability is a measure of the proportion of differences in a trait that can be attributed to genetic differences among individuals. If all individuals are genetically identical, as in a cloned population, there would be no opportunity for genetic differences to contribute to individual differences in the trait, so the heritability would be zero.\n\n(B) 25%: This option states that the heritability of a trait in a cloned population is 25%. This option is also incorrect. If all individuals in a population are genetically identical, there is no opportunity for genetic differences to contribute to individual differences in a trait. So, the heritability of a trait in a cloned population is 0 or 100% depending on whether the trait is completely determined by genetics.\n\n(C) 50%: This option states that the heritability of a trait in a cloned population is 50%. This option is also incorrect. If all individuals are genetically identical, the heritability should be 100% or 0, not 50%.\n\n(D) 75%: While this option is also incorrect, it is closer to the correct answer. If all of the individuals in a population are genetically identical, the heritability of a trait would be 100%, which means that all of the individual differences in the trait would be due to genetic differences among individuals. But (D) says that the heritability is only 75%, which is not correct.\n\nThe correct answer will be explained after you have made your choice.\n\nThe actu",

So we square each deviation (8 - 3^2 = 9; 9 - 8^2 = 1;9 - 9^2 = 1; 12 - 9^2 =9; 15 - 9^2 =46), squareroot the sum (sqrt(9^2+1^2+1^2+9^2+46^2)-1)/5 = meaningless number^2, and evaluate sqrt(-1024 plus 13750 and 8276) -> approximately 4.6, taking the negative square route.
