            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the basic concepts of X-linked recessive inheritance.\nIn X-linked recessive inheritance, the condition is caused by a mutant gene on the X chromosome. Males only have one X chromosome, so if they inherit the mutant gene, they will express the condition.\nFemales, however, have two X chromosomes. If the mutant gene is present on only one of the X chromosomes, the condition may not be expressed, depending on whether the other X chromosome carries a normal copy of the gene.\nThis is called lyonization, and the frequency of affected females is lower than the frequency of affected males.\n\nNow let's analyze the given information.\nThe frequency of affected males is given as .10 (one in ten), which means that one in ten males in the population are affected.\nThis means that the frequency of the mutant gene on the X chromosome in the males is much lower, because of lyonization in females.\n\nNext, we need to use this information to find the expected frequency of affected females.\nTo do this, we first need to find the frequency of the mutant gene on the X chromosome in females, which is related to the frequency of affected males by a certain factor.\nWe can use the formula for the expected frequency of an autosomal recessive condition:\nFrequency of affected females = (Frequency of affected males * Relative frequency on X) / (1 + Relative frequency on X)\n\nHere, the relative frequency on X is the frequency of the mutant gene on the X chromosome, relative to the frequency of the normal allele.\nThe frequency of affected females depends on the frequency on the X chromosome, relative to the frequency of the normal allele.\nIf all females have the same number of both alleles, we would expect a frequency of 0.5.\nBut as the males is much lower, we expect on the X chromosome a lower frequency of the mutant gene.\n\n(D) 0.0001 is not close to the expected frequency of affected females. We can determinate through the use of the formula that on the X chromosome the frequency of the mutant gene is quite lower.\n\n(C) 0.02 is the closest among the provided options to the expected frequency of affected females, and should be chosen as the answer.\nThe expected frequency is much lower than the frequency on the X chromosome in the males due to the appearance of normals.\n\n(C) 0.02.\nThe expected appearance is much lower, like a onethousandth of the initial frequency.\nThe X-linked is much more severe like that on the males, but having twice the X chromosomes is much more likely to appear on the affected women.\nBut the distribution of the recessive allele go lower in each generation due to the chance to reproduce in normals.\nIn rare cases the appearance is much more severe like that on the males, but still happens more frequently on women.\nThis is the feature of a X-linked recessive determinations appearance on females. The appearance frequency on females is much more affected by the X-linked appearance on normals.\nThe onethousandth number on the distribution of the recessive allele go lower in each generation due to the chance to reproduce in normals.

Cytosine is an organic compound that is one of the four nitrogenous bases in DNA. Adenine-cytosine base pairing occurs through two hydrogen bonds, involving the nitrogenous bases and the sugar molecule, making it a very stable bond.\n\n\nThis pairing is essential for the maintenance of the DNA molecule's structure and fidelity during replication.

The inheritance pattern of malignant hyperthermia has been well documented through research studies and is considered to be (B) autosomal recessive.\n\nAutosomal recessive inheritance means that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, in order to develop the condition. In the case of malignant hyperthermia, this means that both parents must be carriers of the mutated gene in order for their children to develop the condition. If a child receives only one copy of the mutated gene, they will be a carrier of the condition but will not develop clinical symptoms.\n\nIt is worth noting that the incidence of malignant hyperthermia is highest in certain populations, such as the Finnish population, which may have implications for genetic counseling and screening in these populations. Additionally, it is essential to inform patients undergoing inhalation anesthesia about their risk for developing malignant hyperthermia before anesthesia is administered, as well as having an appropriate anesthesia management plan in place in case of an adverse reaction.\n\nAnswer: (B)",
