            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(A) telomeres.\n\nExplanation:\nA Robertsonian translocation is a type of chromosomal abnormality where two terminal chromosome segments are fused together, resulting in two chromosomes with changed long arms and loss of heterochromatin. This type of translocation does not occur at telomeres or centromeres. \n\nRobertsonian translocations occur as a result of a fusion of the heterochromatin regions at the tips of the long arms of the chromosome, and the deletion of the centromere and the short arms. The centromere is typically located at or near the center of a chromosome, so it is not where fusion occurs in a Robertsonian translocation. Histones are proteins that provide structural support for chromosomes and do not play a role in fusion.\n\n(A) telomeres.\n\nNote: For additional reference, a general summary on chromosomal abnormalities, including Robertsonian translocations, can be found at the US National Library of Medicine website:\nhttps://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000554.htm.\nIt may be of interest to those interested in learning more background on genetics, and the article provides guidance on giltlines.govand some sources on  this topic.\nWhile azcentral.com provides a nice overview of chromosomal abnormalities and robertsonian translocations:\nhttps://www.azcentral.com/story/life/family/2018/12/14/18-chromosomal-abnormalities-you-should-know/2266611002/ ]\nA combination of non-commercial sources is sometimes made to ensure as complete, accurate, and helpful an answer is possible.\nGenetics, understood in terms of epigenetics may or may not directly apply to InfoSec, but understanding the way cells work, genetic code, and genetic functions may broaden one's knowledge base, which may be helpful and answer potential future questions InfoSecFM.com users may ask. \nThis resource is for guidance and informational purposes only, please check any links built into this assessment especially if they point directly to commercial websites, and talk to your doctor if here is any significant concern about your own medical issues, or those of your friends or acquaintances.\nInfoSecproblem solvers might examine why there are potential security weaknesses White boxes which aren't able to remember information about what they formerly contained - particularly in Man-in the browser (MITB) based attacks. Unlike traditional database-driven systems that keep information, the human brain could be modeled as a \"black box\" in these respects, despite have a bit more memory and a broader information processing front. However epigenetic systems may store useful information for an organism to developing a custom response outside of relatively set bounds of cell specialization.\nIt is flatly wrong to say that security practitioners should only be deeply familiar with subjects directly related to InfoSec, although knowing best-establishes development directions is standard in today's basic training for most InfoSec resources found, sadly, online. \nAny potential InfoSec challenges should require boots on the ground to confirm if a section of code is malicious, or some other authoritative resource. However hands-off exploration of important related or potentially related science topics may be helpful for InfoSec experts, while being a topic of primary importance for InfoSec beginners.\nOutside of one's specific area of research, branching out or philosophizing may provide useful insights. InfoSec experts may gain key insights into areas related to InfoSec from a multitude of sources the average community-trained info sec specialist may overlook or discount. Nevertheless making a special effort to understand possible areas of overlap, such as related types of technologies, informational systems, and source codes, is important in this interconnected knowledge-based economy.\nBrunelUniversity (London, England) created a special 13-minute in-class assignment to make learners Explain the Genetic Code (and adjacent potential for exploding the number of nucleotide sequences without an increase in metabolic energy) Accessed at:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1yNQ2xYR0U last accessed 14/21/2023.\nThis assignment video helps address defects in PhillipsWolley's video series and Phil Plait's video series, pointing to some key issues in the genetic code that touch questions around genetic technology potential, which certainly touches on",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(B) 0.001\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis problem involves understanding the relationship between X-linked recessive inheritance and the frequency of affected individuals in a population.\n\n\nA sex-linked recessive condition can occur in a female only if she has two recessive X-chromosomes, since a dominant allele on the other homologous chromosome can mask the condition.\nFemales with one recessive and one normal X-chromosome are carriers of the condition, but the condition itself will not be expressed.\nMales, on the other hand, will show the condition if they have only one recessive X-chromosome, because there is no other chromosome to mask the condition.\nThus, females will develop a sex-linked recessive condition at a lower frequency than males because only affecteds females will have two recessive alleles (1/2) and then there is the probability of expressing the condition (1/2)\n\nLet\u2019s represent these steps algebraically:\n\n- We know that for a population with a frequency of affected individuals of .10 (one in ten), the frequency of affected males will be: (0.5) +(0.5)(0.5) =0.25 is the frequency of individuals with two recessive alleles and(1-0.25+0.25) =0.5 is the frequency of males\n\n-Now let\u2019s find the frequency of females affected with the condition: (0.5) + (0.5)(0.5) + 0.5 = 1, this happens because all females carry the condition, so the sum of individuals with two recessive alleles, individuals with one allele that expresses the condition because the other allele is normal, and carriers of the condition (females with one recessive and one normal X-chromosome)\n\n-Now we must remove the carrier females: (1-0.5) = 0.5 \n\n-Finally we get half the starting frequency of affected males\n\n(0.5)*0.25 = 0.125",

In order to determine the pattern of inheritance, it is necessary to consider the underlying genetics of the disorder.\n\n\n\n(D) X-linked recessive.\n\n\n\nThe answer is (D) X-linked recessive. The pattern of inheritance seen in malignant hyperthermia is X-linked recessive, which means that the disorder is caused by a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome and is expressed only in individuals who inherit a copy of the mutated gene from their mothers. In contrast, autosomal dominant inheritance (A) means that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder, whereas autosomal recessive inheritance (B) means that the mutation is required on both copies of the gene in order for the disorder to develop. X-linked dominant inheritance (C) means that a mutated gene on the X chromosome would result in the disorder in individuals who have one copy of the gene, whereas in (D) the mutated gene is recessive and thus requires expression from both copies to result in the disorder.",

            "model_answer": "(B) proceeded much more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The question mentions that one of the reasons for the way mapping of human chromosomes has progressed is the availability of DNA markers, which are specific sequences of DNA that can be used to identify and locate genes on a chromosome.\n* option B states that the mapping has proceded more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available.\n* Option C states that the mapping of human chromosomes has determined that the number of linkage groups is about twice the number of chromosomes, which is true but it is not related to the use of\n\nDNA markers.\n\nOption A is not correct because it suggests that mapping of human chromosomes was restricted to the sex chromosomes, but in fact, mapping of human chromosomes includes all chromosomes, not just the sex chromosomes. Option D is incorrect because mapping of human chromosomes has not demonstrated that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes, in fact, only a small proportion of the DNA in the human genome actually codes for proteins.\n\n(B) (because large numbers of DNA markers became available)",
