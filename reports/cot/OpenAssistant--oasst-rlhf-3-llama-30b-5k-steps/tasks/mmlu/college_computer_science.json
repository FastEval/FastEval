            "model_answer": "(A) and (C) are both possibilities. Here is why:\n\n- In order to be a common divisor of two integers, a number must be able to divide both of the integers without leaving a remainder.\n- If a, b, and c are integers, then a is a divisor of b and c if and only if a is a divisor of b - c and b - a. In other words, if a can divide both b and c, then it can also divide their difference (b - c) and the difference between their negatives ( -c + b).\n- Therefore, the set of all common divisors of two integers includes all numbers that can divide both of the integers and all of the difference between the integers and the negative of the difference.\n- To determine whether a number can divide another number without leaving a remainder, we only need to consider its minimal factors. For example, -2 can divide 4 without leaving a remainder because -2 can divide both 2 and -2.\n- Therefore, all we need to consider are the minimal factors of both integers and the negatives of these factors.\n\nTo determine which of the given sets is the set of all common divisors of two integers, we would need to know the specific integers that the common divisors are meant to divide. Therefore, no specific answer can be given.\n\nHowever, based on the given sets, we can determine which sets are possible sets of common divisors:\n\n- (A) is a possibility if the integers that the common divisors are meant to divide are either both multiples of 2 or both multiples of 3.\n6 and -6 are both the negatives of the minimal factors of 2 and 3 in those cases (insufficient information as to which cases), so -6 is a possible common divisor in both of those cases.\n2 and -2 both divide 6, and -1, 0, +1, 2, and 6 all divide some multiple of 2, so (-6,-2,0, +1,2,6,[2,2,6]) is a possible set of common divisors.\n- (B) is not a possibility, because every number included in (B) except -6,0,1, and 2, can divide -2, and -2 is not a common divisor of any two integers.\nAll numbers in (C) can divide all numbers included in (C), so (C) is a possibility.\n(D) includes every possible common divisor of some set of integers, so (D) is also a possibility.\n\nTherefore, (A) and (C) are both possibilities. However, both (B) (because it includes -0 and includes some negative numbers) and (D) (bc all itse numbers are included in (C)) are unnecessarily large for this purpose, so (C) is the most appropriate answer.\n\nAnswer: (C).",
