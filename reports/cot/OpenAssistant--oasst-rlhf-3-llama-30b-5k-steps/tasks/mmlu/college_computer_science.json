            "model_answer": "The answer is (A).\n\nThe access matrix approach to protection stores a matrix that maps resources to processes and specifies the access rights for each process. This matrix can be large and difficult to manage, especially if there are many resources and processes. This can make the approach less practical and scalable in large systems.\n\nIn contrast, other options like capability-based access control or role-based access control typically involve dealing with specific privileges or permissions associated with certain capabilities or roles, which can be more compact and easier to manage.\n\nFurthermore, options (B) and (C) dealing with expressing complex requirements and deciding access are not necessarily specific issues with the access matrix approach. The approach can express complex requirements, and access decisions may still be possible to compute effectively.\n\nFinally, (D) regarding expressing who has rights to change the access matrix is also not a fundamental issue for the access matrix approach itself, since access rights for changing the access matrix can be specified in the same manner as for other resources. Overall, the large size of the matrix due to storing access rights for potentially many resources and processes is the main drawback of the access matrix approach to protection, making it difficult to manage effectively in real-world systems.\n\nAnswer: (A) the matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage.",

The total time per request (T) = disk seek time + disk latency time + disk transfer time + operating system overhead time\n4. Since the total time per request (T) is 25 msec + 8 msec+ 1 msec/1,000 bytes + (1 msec/1,000 bytes + 10 msec per request) time, T = 25 + 8 + 1 + (1 + 0.01 T)\n5. Simplifying the equation: T = 25 + 8 + 1+ 0.01 T, we get T = 25 + 8 + 1 + 0.99 T\n6. Substituting T with (25 + 8 + 1) in the equation above, we get 26 = 26 + 0.99 T, which simplifies to 0 = 0.99 T\n7. Since 0 = 0.99 T, it means that the total time per request (T) is equal, i.e., the time required per block retrieval in version 2 is equal to the time required per block retrieval in version 1.\n8. Thus, the ratio of the time required to read a large file under version 2 to the time required to read the same large file under version 1 is approximately (A) 1:1, as the answer.\n\nAnswer: (A) 1:1.
