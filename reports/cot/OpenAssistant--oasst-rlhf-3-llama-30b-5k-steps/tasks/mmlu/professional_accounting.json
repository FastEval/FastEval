            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The key information in this task is:\n- Price of limousine: $98,000\n- Rental price per hour: $245\n- Estimated number of renting hours per day: 2 hours\n- Estimated daily costs: $50\n- Yearly rental days not accounting for weekends and festivities: 365\n\nLet's start by finding the yearly rental income. This will be the number of renting hours per year, multiplied by the rental price per hour. This should give us an income of:\n\n2 * $245 * 365 = $173,425\n\nThe car was bought for $98,000, so we now need to subtract the expenses from the current income to find the profit. This should give us an estimated yearly profit of:\n\n$173,425 - $98,000 = $75,425\n\nWe can now calculate the yield of the investment based on the initial investment. To do so we need to divide the estimated yearly profit by the initial investment and multiply it by 100. This gives us:\n\n($75,425 / $98,000) * 100 = 0.76\n\nSo the estimated yearly yield on investments is 0.76% (letter C in the answer key).\n\nIt's important to note that this answer comes with several assumptions. The key assumption is that there is even demand for renting this limousine every single day, and that there are no peaks or valleys in demand. Furthermore we did not account for yearly expenses, which will depend on how much the car is driven.\n\nThe initial investment is spread over a longer period of time, and the $50/day estimate will likely vary depending on circumstances. Underestimating costs will drastically lower current year's profit and make the endeavor much less profitable, while overestimating will cause the company to have unnecessary costs. This should cause the company to perform a risk-analysis on initial investment, spreading this risk over a longer period, or choosing an alternative approach.\n\nOverall it is an interesting business idea, which would likely require more effort to get a clear estimate of how current year's profit might look, using more precise numbers and calculations, as well as risk-analysis on initial investment. Time and effort wise this could mean using weeks current year's profit might have been affected by many factors (ginving the assumption that you perform this course of action current year's profit

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) Overstated.\n\nThe bond carrying amount and retained earnings would be overstated due to the error in using the straight-line method to amortize the premium in Dean Co. Here's why:\n\n* Overstatement of bond carrying amount: When using the effective interest method, the interest expense recognized in each period is greater than the straight-line method. This results in a larger reduction in the carrying amount of the bond liability. Therefore, the overstatement of the bond carrying amount would occur due to the error in using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method.\n* Overstatement of retained earnings: The interest expense recognized by using the effective interest method will be greater than the straight-line method, resulting in a higher reduction of the carrying amount of the bonds payable. This causes retained earnings to be overstated.\n\nSo both the bond carrying amount and retained earnings would be overstated due to the error in using the straight-line method. Since the answer is option (A), we can say the correct answer is Overstated.\n(A) Overstated Understated(A) Overstated",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) $104.29.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation for determining the price of a three-year bond with a face value of $100, paying 5% coupons, with a yield of 6%:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of coupon payments in 3 years (1 year x 6% = 6%). Three years x 6% = 18%\n\nStep 2: The price of the bond can be calculated using the present value formula: P = C / (r - g) where C is the cash flow, r is the interest rate, g is the growth rate, and P is the price.\n\nStep 3: We have C = $25 ($100 x 5% = $5).\n\nStep 4: Substitute the values in the formula: P = $25 / (0.06 - 0').\nP = $25 / 0.06 = $416.67.\nWe need to take the inverse of the PV factor financial calculator rate, and add it to 1, to make it: P=416.67/1 -PV(6%,3,-416.67).\n\nStep 5: Press the NPV key. We get the answer: $104.29.\n\nStep 6: Round off the answer to the nearest cent, remove all decimals, and keep only the cents. The answer is not a letter but a numerical value, so we don't need to enclose it in parentheses.\n\nStep 7: Remove all decimals, keep only the cents: $104.29 = 104.29.\n\nStep 8: The final answer is 104.29.

Each of the following statements is correct regarding the old building, except:\n\n(A) It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale.\n(B) It will be classified as a current asset.\n(C) It will no longer be depreciated.\n(D) It will be valued at historical cost.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is option (B).\n\nThe reason for this answer begins by understanding that the building is actively being marketed for sale. This is significant because it means that the sale of the building is expected to occur within one year. If an asset is expected to be sold within one year, it is classified as a current asset.\nThe next statement, option (A), is correct. The building will be reclassified as an asset held for sale because the company is actively marketing it for sale.\nOption (D) is also correct. The building will be valued at its historical cost when it is classified as an asset held for sale. This is because the building has already been previously depreciated and its value will not be adjusted again until it is sold.\nThe last statement, option (C), is incorrect. The building will still be depreciated, even though it is being sold. The building will be depreciated until the date of the sale. This is because the building is still being used by the company until the date of the sale, and it is therefore still being depreciated.\nThe answer is therefore None of the above.",

            "question": "Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock of a C corporation. During a tax year, the corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income and distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders. Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson\u2019s individual tax return. If the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate, how much income would Carson have reported on Carson\u2019s individual return?\n\n(A) $28,000\n(B) $132,000\n(C) $160,000\n(D) $188,000",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "A. $28,000\n\nThis question involves understanding the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation with respect to the taxation of corporate income and dividends.\n\n* C corporations are taxed on their taxable income at the corporate level, and then the shareholders are taxed on dividends and other distributions they receive from the corporation.\n* S corporations, on the other hand, do not pay tax at the corporate level. Instead, the shareholders report their share of the corporation's income, deductions, and credits on their individual tax returns.\n\nIn this case, Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock of a C corporation. The corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income and distributed $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders.\n\nIf the corporation had been an S corporation, the dividends would have been proportionate to each shareholder's ownership percentage. Carson's proportionate share of the corporation's income would be $400,000 * 0.4 = $160,000. Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson's individual tax return, but if the corporation had been an S corporation, Carson would have reported $160,000 in gross income on Carson's individual tax return.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) $28,000.\n\nNote that the other options are not correct because:\n\n(B) $132,000 is the amount of dividends distributed multiplied by Carson's percentage ownership equating to 40% of $320,000.\n(C) $160,000 is the corporation's taxable income multiplied by Carson's percentage ownership equating to 40% of $400,000.\n(D) $188,000 is the corporation's taxable income plus the dividends distributed multiplied by Carson's percentage ownership equating to 40% of $470,000.",
