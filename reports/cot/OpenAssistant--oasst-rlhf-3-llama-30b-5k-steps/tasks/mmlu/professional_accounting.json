            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the estimated yearly yield on the investment.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how many hours the car will be rented per year. Since there are 365 days in a year, and the car will be rented for 2 hours per day on average, the total number of rental hours per year is:\n\n2 hours/day * 365 days/year = 730 hours/year\n\nNext, we need to determine the total revenue generated by the rentals per year. This is equal to:\n\nTotal revenue = 730 hours/year * $245/hour = $177,550/year\n\nThe yearly yield on the investment is equal to the rental revenue minus the daily expenses.\n\nYearly yield = Total revenue - (Expenses/365) * Short days/year - (Total expenses / 365) * Long days/year - Expenses for Short days + Expenses for Long days\n\nTotal revenue is equal to:\n\nTotal revenue = Total revenue per short day * Short days/year + Total revenue per long day * Long days/year\n\nSince there are 7 days/week, we have one short day and 7 long days per week. Therefore, we have:\n\nTotal revenue = ($245/hour - ($50/day / 7 days/week)) * 7 days/week - ($245/hour - ($50/day / 7 days/week)) * 0 days/week\n\nExpand and simplify to get:\n\nTotal revenue = $1640/week - (-$250/week)\n\nTotal revenue = $1890/week\n\nSince there are 52 weeks/year:\n\nTotal revenue = $95,040\n\nWe also need to calculate the expenses:\n\n(Expenses/365) * Short days/year = (Daily costs / 365) * 5 * 52 = $6076\n\n((Expenses/365) * Long days/year = (Daily costs / 365) * 52 = $48560\n\nTotal expenses = Expenses for Short days + Expenses for Long days\n\nTotal expenses = Total expenses for Short days + Total expenses for Long days\n\nTotal expenses = $6076 + $48560\n\nTotal expenses = $54,642\n\nThen, we have:\n\nYearly yield = $95,040 - ($54,642 / 365) - ($54,642 / 365) * (52 / 52) - $6076 - $48560\n\nParenthesis: $95,040 - $362.320\n\nAnswer: (B) 1.64%",

In a nonissuer audit, nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\nStep-by-Step Notes:\n\nThe given question asks about the correct statement about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer.\nWe need to determine which statement correctly defines nonsampling risk from other types of risks.\nNonsampling risks in auditing refer to the possibility that audit conclusions may be different from the actual results, if the auditor had tested every item in the population.\nSo, Statement A correctly defines audit sampling risks as arising from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\nTherefore, the answer is (A). Answer: A(Nonsampling risks arise from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor tested each item in the population).\n\nNote: This is a subjective question.

Option (A) Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end would not be a procedure an auditor would perform regarding subsequent events, as it pertains instead to the earlier period's inventory.\n4. Option (B) Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate would not be a procedure an auditor would perform regarding subsequent events. Such procedures would have been done during the audit of prior period, and if internal controls were reported as inadequate any impact would have been reflected on prior years' financial statements.\n5. Option (C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after theaudit report issuance date is not particularly relevant to subsequent events, as it just provides information of the client's cash position.\n6. Option (D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited  would be the applicable procedure.\n7. Answer:D (Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited)\n\nIt should be clarified that if the company prepares interim financial statements, the auditor should examine those to asses the potential existence of subsequent events until the date of the interim financial statements.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we first need to understand the difference between the straight-line method and the effective interest method.\n\nThe straight-line method calculates the interest expense and amortization of the premium by dividing the total interest expense over the life of the bond by the number of periods in the same interval.\n\nThe effective interest method, on the other hand, takes into account interest accruals and bond premiums. It is a more complex approach than the straight-line method, and it yields a higher value for interest expense and lower value for amortization of bond premium in the earlier periods.\n\nUsing the straight-line method, the bond carrying value and retained earnings will be overstated because the interest expense and premium amortization are lower in earlier periods compared to the more accurate effective interest method. Therefore, (A) and (B) are incorrect.\n\nUsing the effective interest method, the bond carrying value and retained earnings will be understated because the interest expense and premium amortization are higher than the straight-line method. Options (B) and (C) are incorrect.\n\nThe answer is (D) since the straight-line method is being used which is not in compliance with the GAAP.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(A) $100 is incorrect. The price of the bond will be lower than $100 if the yield to maturity (YTM) is greater than the coupon rate. To calculate the price, we need to discount the coupon payments and the face value to the present value using the yield to maturity.\n\n(B) $104.29 is incorrect. The correct answer is (C) $96.71. To calculate the bonds price, we can use the YTM formula:\n\nPrice = C / (YTM / n) + (FV / (1 + YTM)n)\n\nwhere C is the coupon payment, YTM is the yield to maturity, n is the number of coupon periods per year (3 for semiannual bonds) and FV is the face value.\n\n(D) $97.33 is incorrect. The correct answer is (B) $97(.33). To calculate the first coupon payment, we multiply the face value by the coupon rate and divide by the number of coupon payments per year:\n\nC = (FV * coupon rate) / n\n\nThe coupon payment is 5% of 100, which is $5(5%) = $2.50. We divide by 2 since there are two coupon payments per year. Then, we use the formula for the bond price mentioned above and substitute the coupon payment:\n\nPrice = C / (YTM / n) + (FV / (1 + YTM)n)\n\nPrice = [2.50 / (6% / 2)] + [100 / (1 + 6% / 2)^3] = $98.206\n\nSo, the correct answer is $98.206, but we should round it to two decimal places: $98.21.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine Carson's taxable income from S corporation distributions, we need to first determine the corporation's net income available for distribution. This will require subtracting the $400,000 in taxable income, the $70,000 in dividends paid, and any other distributions or expenses from any other items that affect net income. Then, we must determine the proportion of Carson's ownership to apply that percentage to the net income available for distribution. This will give us the amount of taxable income Carson would have reported on her individual return.\n\nNote that we do not need to use the $28,000 Carson reported on her individual return as this was based on the C corporation's taxable income and is not relevant for determining S corporation income.\n\n(C) $160,000 is Carson's taxable income based on the above rationale, assuming all the other factors need to determine net income available for S corporation distribution were the same as an S corporation as to the C corporation. It is the net income available for distribution divided by the proportion of ownership, which is 40% in this case ($160,000 / 0.4 = $400,000).
