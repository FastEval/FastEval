            "question": "The weight of an aspirin tablet is 300 milligrams according to the bottle label. An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim.

            "model_answer": "1. We know that the mean weight of the aspirin tablets should be 300 milligrams according to the manufacturer's claim.\n2. We took a simple random sample of 7 tablets and obtained the weights needed for the hypothesis test.\n3. We know we need to run a hypothesis test to test the manufacturer's claim that every tablet should weight 300 milligrams.\n4. We need to find the P-value of this test to determine whether to reject or not reject the manufacturer's claim.\n5. Since we know the weight of one tablet in milligrams (300), the mean weight of each tablet in milligrams needed, the sample size (7), and we used a simple random sample, we will use a one-sample t-test to run our hypothesis test.\n6. We will use the formula for the one-sample t-test to find the P-value of this test. The formula is P(t > t(df)) = 2 / the column of dfs if the test statistic (t) is greater than the critical value (t(df)).\n7. We obtained the test statistic, t(7) = 1.54 and df(7-1) = 6.\n8.

(D). 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7.\n10. The correct answer is (D).

Here is an example to illustrate this:\n\nSuppose a p-value of 0.055 is calculated (i.e. 5.5%).\n\n* The p-value of 0.055 is higher than the 10% threshold (>= 5.5%), so we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 10% level.\n* however, the p-value of 0.055 is still lower than the 5% threshold (< 5%), so we still reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level (\n\nTherefore, statement (A) is false since p-values are compared to thresholds and do not change depending on the chosen level.\n\n(B) Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.
