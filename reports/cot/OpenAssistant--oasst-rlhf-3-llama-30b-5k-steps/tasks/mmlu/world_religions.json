            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Answer: D\n\nExplanation:\nMurtis can be translated as Idols in Hinduism. It refers to the sculptures or statues of deities or mythical figures which are used for worship and meditation. (A), (B), and (C) are all incorrect.

A naturalist in this context is someone who studies nature and natural phenomena, rather than supernatural or theoretical phenomena.\n\nOption (A): Daoism is concerned with spiritual practices and philosophical ideas, but not necessarily focused on empirical observation of nature.\n\nOption (C): Mengzi, also known as Mencius, was a Confucian philosopher who believed in a spiritual, immortal soul and the concept of \"ren\" (humaneness or goodness).\n\nOption (D): Humanistic Buddhism is a Buddhist movement that emphasizes humanistic values such as education, social welfare, and environmental protection, but the focus is more on Buddhist teachings rather than natural elements and processes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Yin-Yang School, which is a school of thought associated with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang, concerned with the empirical observation of the natural world and the laws that govern it. The Yin-Yang School is associated with the study of natural elements and processes such as the relationship between light and darkness, heat and cold, the cycles of nature such as rain and snow, and the laws regulating these elements.
