            "model_answer": "(B) neither party has an incentive to deviate from his or her strategy. At a Nash equilibrium, neither party can benefit from deviating from their chosen strategy, because the other party will respond accordingly. This means that they are both stuck with the equilibrium outcome, but neither would prefer to change to a different outcome. It also implies that both parties were rational in choosing their initial strategies, given the strategies chosen by the other party, which leads to the intersection of supply and demand curves. (B) neither party has an incentive to deviate from his or her strategy.",

            "model_answer": "(D) goods X and Y are substitute goods.\nIt is true that the cross-price elasticity between goods X and Y being +2.0 indicates that goods X and Y are substitute goods, because a positive cross-price elasticity indicates that an increase in the price of one good will lead to an increase in demand for the other good. When two goods are substitutes, an increase in the price of one good will cause consumers to substitute the other good in order to achieve a similar level of satisfaction at a lower price, leading to an increase in demand for the other good.

            "model_answer": "The government discourages collusion between large firms in the same industry because it can lead to a reduction in competition and an increase in prices for consumers. One reason for this is that when firms collude, they may agree to restrict output, which can drive the price of their products above the competitive level. This reduction in competition can lead to a decrease in consumer choice and a reduction in consumer surplus.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "As an oligopolist will not follow a price increase, any price increase will lead to a loss of market share and therefore, the demand curve featuring a competitor's decision to increase prices would not be the demand curve facing an oligopolist. Contrarily, an oligopolist would follow a price decrease and as we need to consider the case where rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase, we can eliminate (B) and (D) as perfectly elastic and highly inelastic demand curves do not reflect the case where rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase either.\n\nFurthermore, imperfectly elastic demand curves tend to have a positive slope with the elasticity changing across the various segment with segments closest to perfect competition having higher elasticity. This matches the hypothesis of what rival firms' would do in the case facing an oligopolist when they follow a price decrease but not an increase.
