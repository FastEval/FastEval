To see why this is true, consider the smallest group with an element of order 15 - the group Z15. In Z15, there is only one element of order 15, 1, and there are no other elements of order 15.

If a group is isomorphic to a factor group of G, then it must also be a homomorphic image of G. (Given Statement 1)\n2. The homomorphic image of G is just the set of all possible subgroups of G generated by the embedding map from G to H. This set includes just the trivial group {e} if G is abelian, and all possible subgroups otherwise. (Familiarity with group theory)\n3. If H is isomorphic to a factor group of G, then it must be contained in some factor group of G, but is not necessarily equal to that factor group. (Compatibility with familiar factor groups)\n4. Two groups H and H' (obtained by mapping G and G' respectively) , that are isomorphic as groups, may not necessarily be isomorphic to each other as factors of G or G' respectively. (Complications with factor groups)\n5. Therefore, we cannot conclude that all factor groups of G are homomorphic images of G, or that all homomorphic images of G are factor groups of G.

We can also solve for the other zeros by factoring the polynomial as (x - 0)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 1)/2.\n6. Substituting x = 1 in this polynomial, we get 1^2 + 1 = 2, which is not a zero.\n7. Substituting x = -1 in this polynomial, we get -1^2 + 1 = 0, which is a zero.\n8. Thus, the other zero of the polynominal is x = -1.\n9. Putting our results together, the zeros of the polynominal x^3 + 2x + 2 in Z_7 are x = 0 and x = -1.\n10. The answer is (A) 1 and (B) 2, because we found 1 root (x = 0) and 1 double root (x = -1).\n\nAnswer: (A) 1 and (B) 2",
