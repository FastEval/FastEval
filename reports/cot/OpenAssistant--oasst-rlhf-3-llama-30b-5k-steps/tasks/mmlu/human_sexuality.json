            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(B) Mammography involves exposure to radiation.\n\nExplanation:\nMammography is a breast cancer screening tool that uses low-dose X-rays to capture images of the breast. As ionizing radiation is used during the mammography process, this method of detection exposes the patient to a low dose of radiation. Other methods such as needle aspiration, lumpectomy and mastectomy do not involve radiation exposure during the detection process. Therefore, the answer is (B) Mammography.",

            "model_answer": "1. Let's start by looking at each of the options:\n2. (A) The question states, \"The regions of the body that, when touched, are sexually exciting: vary from person to person.\" Based on this, I would expect (A) to be the correct answer as it suggests that different people may have different erogenous zones.\n3. (B) The question states, \"The regions of the body that, when touched, are sexually exciting: vary for women depending on the phases of the menstrual cycle.\" Based on this, (B) also seems to be a valid answer as it suggests that a woman's erogenous zones may be different at different points in her menstrual cycle.\n4. (C) The question states, \"The regions of the body that, when touched, are sexually exciting: are mainly on the lower portion of the body.\" Based on this, I would also consider (C) to be a valid answer as some commonly known erogenous zones like the genitals are located in the lower portion of the body.\n5. From the above analysis, all three answer options (A), (B), and (C) seem to be valid answers, However, they are all correct, and we need to check for any additional information to eliminate one of them.\n6. Unfortunately, the question is not providing any additional information to eliminate any further options.\n7. Hence, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) all of the above (as all three answers (A), (B) and (C) appear to be correct based on the information provided, However, they are not mutually exclusive, and all three can be true at the same time.)",

            "model_answer": "There are more males than females with paraphilias because:\n\n(B) evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli.\n\nExplanation:\n\nEvolutionary selection refers to the idea that traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction are more likely to be passed on to future generations. In the case of paraphilias, it is believed that males who are more sexually adventurous are more likely to mate and reproduce successfully, which would explain why there are more males than females with these conditions.\n\nIt's worth noting that this is just one theory, and there may be other factors at play as well, such as cultural or social influences. However, evolutionary selection is a plausible explanation for the observed higher rate of paraphilias in men.",
