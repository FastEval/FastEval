            "model_answer": "The statement that expresses a relationship between aging and sexual functioning is:\n\n(D) Aging is related to some loss of erectile rigidity in the male.\n\nReasoning:\n\n* It is known that aging can affect sexual functioning in both males and females, including changes in libido, arousal, and orgasmic response.\n* However, statement (A) is incorrect because aging is often associated with a decrease in vaginal lubrication, which can make sexual activity more difficult.\n* Statement (B) is also incorrect because aging is often associated with a decrease in sexual frequency and orgasmic intensity in both males and females.\n* Therefore, the statement that expresses a relationship between aging and sexual functioning is (D) that aging is related to loss of erectile rigidity in males. It is worth noting that aging does not always lead to complete loss of erectile rigidity in males and it varies from individual to individual.",

            "model_answer": "(C) \u201cLittle scientists\u201d\n\nPiaget\u2019s theory of cognitive development emphasizes the role of children as active participants in their own learning. He believed that children are born with a basic mental structure (schema) that allows them to process information and form beliefs about the world around them.\n\nAccording to Piaget, children are active learners who seek to understand the world by using their own experiences. They rely on their physical and sensory abilities to observe and gather information, and their thinking abilities to interpret and make sense of this information.\n\nPiaget believed that children learn through exploratory play, which allows them to test their understanding of the world and acquire new knowledge. This process of discovery is rooted in the child\u2019s curiosity and desire to understand their environment.\n\nPiaget\u2019s theory emphasizes that children are not blank slates (A), but rather active learners (C) who possess an innate capacity for understanding the world. While children may lack the same level of intelligence and knowledge as adults, they are not necessarily less intelligent (B). Culture plays a role in shaping a child\u2019s development (D), but it is not the sole determinant.\n\nThus, the answer is (C) \u201cLittle scientists\u201d.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that Piaget's theory has faced some criticism and revisions by other theorists, such as Jerome Bruner and David Kolb, who offer alternative perspectives on learning and cognition.",
