Draw a vertical line through point Q. We want to find the range of $f(1)$, which is the $y$-coordinates of the intersection of the horizontal line passing through point P and the vertical line passing through point Q.\n\nFirstly, we notice that P and Q are both on the same side of the vertical line that passes through point Q.\n\nConsider the left-hand side of the interval notation.\nLet's assume $f(1)$ is at the bottom of the intersection of the horizontal line passing through point P and the vertical line passing through point Q. In order for this to happen, $f(1)$ must have a higher $y$-coordinate than point P $(-2,5)$. Since $f(-2)=5$, this means $f(1)$ should have a lower value for $x$ less than -2 such that the quadratic $y=f(x)$ has a lower value at x=1 than at x=-2 i.e. the portion of the quadratic between x=1 and x=-2 is below the line segment passing through the points (-2,5) and (1,f(1)). Since we multiplied it by a convex function $f(x)$, the portion of the graph of $y=f(x)$ between x=1 and -2 should be entirely below the line segment whose endpoints are (-2,5) and (1,f(1)).

We can use Bayes' theorem to write the probability of no rain and no sun as: P(no rain and no sun) = P(no sun | no rain) * P(no rain)\n4.
