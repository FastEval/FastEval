            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(B) This type occurs in young galaxies. Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n* Type Ia supernovae are a type of thermonuclear explosion that occurs in a white dwarf, a compact object made of degenerate matter.\n* The explosion is caused by a process called carbon-oxygen fusion, where the white dwarf reaches its maximum mass allowed by its own gravity, leading to a catastrophic collapse.\n* To reach this maximum mass limit, the white dwarf has to accrete matter from a companion star in a binary system.\n* The explosion is extremely bright and can be used as a standard candle to determine cosmic distances, since their absolute magnitude is known.\n* Therefore, type Ia supernovae occur in binary systems. Answer: (B) This type occurs in young galaxies.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.\nThink of it this way. The atmosphere is composed of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, etc. and small amounts of other gases like water vapour. It is these gases and the molecules they are comprised of, that make up a good part of the atmosphere. The light we see comes from the Sun, or a nearby star. These photons have a particular wavelength, and lets say most of the photons, that reach the Earth from Sun have a wavelength somwhere in the visible spectrum - that means most of these light\u2013photons\u2013aren\u2019t absorbed by the atmosphere. Now, their wavelengths could be of many sorts, ranging from violet to red. Violet is, you could sayie specially visible, because most things that absorb violet light, do emitt it too. But actually what\u2019s left after most of the visible spectrum has been dealt with, is blue light. Because nitrogen and oxygen molecules present in the atmosphere selectively scatter away red, yellow, orange and green. Meaning the blue light\u2013the shortest spectrum\u2013is scattered and reaches our eyes from all directions.\n\nBlue light with all other light, and sometimes about half  as much\u2013 considering daylight during a full moon\u2013travels more than 93 million miles afrom its progenitor, and still most of it scatters in through our windows! Comprehensively, I would say th atmosphere appreciates blue (short spectrum) photons more. Or may be, we are mostly depriving it off the red (long spectrum) photons. Whichever paint\u2013red or blue\u2013 may be more applicable to the darker part of the day, but the brighter the day, things are likely bluer and more vivid to the eyes. Note however, what we understand by blue light just like what we understand by\u2013in accordance with our presence in the middle of \u201cGoldilocks\u201d\u2013 the searing heat of the Sun, depends on the observer. There are creatures under the sea with no light at all, or atleast very very little. So comparing apples and oranges does take effort. Alright!",

Titan is the only outer solar system moon with a thick atmosphere. This is true because Titan is the only moon with a substantial atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen with clouds and hazes consisting of complex organic compounds.\n2. Titan is the only outer solar system moon with evidence for recent geologic activity. This is also true because Titan has extensive surface changes which suggest that its surface is currently active, such as flows, dunes, and ooze-like features, and its atmosphere experiences methane rainfall.\n3. Titan's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrocarbons. This is also true because Titan's atmosphere contains large amounts of nitrogen and methane, the latter of which is a hydrocarbon, as well as other organic compounds like ethane and propane.\n4. Titan is the only outer solar system moon with a thick atmosphere.

Knocking pieces of rock off and sending debris flying around may be helpful for watching gravity waves, but it doesn't necessarily tell us the age of the source rocks. 'A' claims that all lunar rocks are connected to impacts, 'C' claims that erosion is observed on the Moon's surface, and 'D' suggests that there is a relationship between impact craters and rock ages. However, the evidence 'B' directly tests the ages of rocks on the Moon and Earth, so 'B' is the correct answer (save 'D', as it may not really indicate rock age and the clause \"more earth rocks are younger than moon rocks\" is poor wording compared to clause 'B'), as the interaction of magma and radioactive decay helps to age date rocks with uniformitarian-like confidence. Also, checking the Moon's older face (the one without us and Earth blocks out the sun from it, called the \"dark side\") versus the newer face (the one we observes phases) shows a great difference and uniformitarian-like-confirmed age difference without looking at radioactivity. Even a giant glow in the dark bulb has radioactive decay somewhere in its wiring.",

If a near-earth asteroid gradually disintegrates, it would spread small particles along its orbital path. When Earth passes through that orbital path, particles hitting the atmosphere would produce the meteor shower. This option is explaining the cause of the meteor shower and its relation with near-earth asteroids. Although the answer is not yet confirmed, this option has the most relevant information for a meteor shower from near-earth objects, so it can be chosen as the temporary answer.\n\n(B) Near-Earth asteroids disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a single location in the sky. This option corrects the missing information in option A, by proposing that when a near-earth asteroid disintegrates, it creates a lot of meteors. However, this option does not explain the source of the material causing the meteor shower. The invalid information is hiding the answer. This option can be eliminated.\n\n(C) The nuclei of comets disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a central location in the sky. Comets can disintegrate as they get close to the sun, but not as they enter Earth's atmosphere. The information in this option is incorrect, since it is talking about comets, and not about the material causing meteor showers. This option is invalid and can be eliminated.\n\n(D) The nuclei of comets gradually disintegrate and spread out along the comet's orbital path. If a comet gradually disintegrates, the small particles spread along its orbital path. When the Earth passes through that orbital path, particles hitting the atmosphere would produce the meteor shower. This option forgot to mention that the small particles would cause the meteor shower when the Earth passes. This option is missing an important information to be considered the correct answer, but it seems to be a more simplified version of option A, which is the temporary answer.\n\nAnalyzing the given options and reasoning about them, by rule of elimination and checking for the correct answer in each option. we can conclude that the most accurate answer is:\n\n(A) Near-Earth asteroids gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital path.
