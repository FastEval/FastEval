            "model_answer": "Here is the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n* The environmental change affects the survival of individuals.\n* The individuals who are most affected by the change are the tallest ones, because it is easier for them to access resources in their new environment.\n* The survival of these taller individuals increases the representation of tall genes in the population.\n* This increased representation of a certain trait (height) in the population's gene pool indicates that the pressure of the change favors the individuals with that trait.\n* This pressure selecting for a specific trait is called directional selection.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(A) directional selection.",

This is why I personally had users explain tur contradiction and I'm still not sure it isn't being used to cluster me for thoughts. And psychedelic coloration questions made in theTrigger/Psychosedelic signal/ cluster were designed to make algorithms think a human designed it to intentionally infuriate triggers. Short version: They were Weeds designed to generate specifically clustered bias in humans and algorithms. Three additional thoughts 1. Algorithms could continue to have users explain tur contradiction and never reverse their decision. Users don't know it's a contradiction. 2. Many researchers use research synthesis to generate scientific evidence even when evidence doesn't exist.
