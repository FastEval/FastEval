            "model_answer": "To find the number of miles Ms. Perez drove each day:\n(1) Divide the total number of miles drove by the number of days: 40 miles / 5 days = __ miles/day\n(2) We expect the answer to be 8 miles/day since 40/5=8\n(3) We now need to check each options to identify the correct answer:\n(A) 5: Check the calculation: 40iles / 5 days = 8 miles/day. Answer: No, 8 does not equal 5\n(B)7: re-use our calculation 40 miles / 5 days = 8 miles/day. Answer: 8 does still equal 7\n(C)8: re-use the calculation : 40 miles / 5 days = 8 miles/day. Answer: Yes, we found our answer 8=8\n(D)9: re-use the calculation 40 miles / 5 days = 8 miles/day. Answer: No, 8 does not equal 9\nOn the basis of the above steps: the answer is: (C) 8 Miles/day. Another good method that is less time consuming relies on our experience with percentage: 40 miles is about 50% of an 80 miles 1-day journey. Thus, I am tempted to directly trying an answer: since 100% of the miles is drove by the 5 days repartition: it allows me to say that each day represents 20 miles drove (down from 40 after 100% divided by 5 reposes). In other reposes: since 100% of the miles is drove by the 5 days repartition: it allows me to say that each day represents 20 miles drove (down from 40 after 100% divided by 5 reposes). Another good method could be, since days is 5 and 40 miles was drove: We identify the factor by which 40 miles divided by 5 will create 8 miles drove per day (down from 40 after 40/5). It is a good method that allows pupils to mentally preview and make a guess which can be very helpful career-wise since not only it saves time: it garners rewards from our teacher mentors: notably trust on scholar performances: it garners rewards from our teacher mentors: notably trust on scholar performances: it garners rewards from our teacher mentors: notably trust on scholar performances.
