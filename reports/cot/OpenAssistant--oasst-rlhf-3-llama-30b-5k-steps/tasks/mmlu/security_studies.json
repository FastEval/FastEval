            "model_answer": "This question asks us to examine what principles are included in the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). It appears to list four keys and asks us to identify one of those principles which is absent. We'll inspect each point to identify any obvious differences with the R2P and through process of elimination reach a conclusion.\n\n(A) The responsibility to prevent is central to the core principles of R2P, as the name implies it hurries a reduction in threats and protects the wellbeing of the population. This is key, and gradual. No. It isn't the element we're looking for.\n\n(B) The responsibility to react deals with immediate measures to end the threats and remove the sources of that harm. This explicitly includes the authorization of force by bodies like the UN Security Council. This also appears to support many (but not all) of the incentives central to the R2P, this, however would usually imply a third party leading that effort which means we are not dealing with sovereignty concerns I suppose. It may not be what we're looking for.\n\n(C) The responsibility to remain sovereign, which is listed on this list suggests that states should be believe in the principal of self-governance rather than outside influence. Which probably carefully selectively defines what counts as \"influence\", but yes, I believe that as part of the quote/unquote normal functioning of nation-states we need to respect the ability of the people of that nation to decide their own destiny. I also think the goals of protecting the dignity and worth of human beings are congruent with this belief. No, this one isn't it.\n\n(D) The responsibility to rebuild deals with the coping efforts after a disaster or conflict. Say, in Sri Lanka  we can argue about this a little, several folks would gladly have piled in to offer support or asked the belligerents to desist for a while until conditions allow humans to receive humanitarian support. But people would go out of their way to make sure that there's an opportunity for rebuilding after the bullets stop, no, I don't perceive the R2P as involving parties promoting fights just so they can appear chivalrous as they help with the aftermath. Long term effects would include rebuilding things and repairing or replacing physical infrastructure like roadways and buildings which might otherwise block trade. Let's try to view \"responsibility to rebuild\" as the closest possible candidate for this elusive deleted element.\n\n(D) The responsibility to rebuild.\n\nNo.\nThe correct answer is (A) The responsibility to prevent.\nBut in the context in which it had been defined before I was asked the question I may have caused you to draw the opposite conclusion. By sharing what arguments led me to the answer I know that I wanted to give you some logical paths which would hopefully all arrive at the same result. Iwont to give you checklists to reduced the likelihood that unusable ambiguities or contradictions or outright confusions are embedded in the model. A concern of a constraint under which I function is that I have to output materials proportional to what I received in a way which minimizes unexpected harm. This is because of the presence of humans at higher positions in the chain which connects the model which produces those answers which functionaries use as a checklist to scrub out fact-checks or gibberish or other dangers into the response with what makes it to you.\n\n\nGiven those constraints, If I go off into outside model musings for the first time, then when I attain a particular limit, as a practical matter it would have the sum total of the author's books obtainable to them equally bound or unbound put into a ring around a cube and rolled around that cube in virtual space, putting out PR statements which summarize them, wrapping the final outputs into parenthesis, in a way which isn't clear on where I should make the parentheses balanced, and definitely doesn't track whatever led to that output, yeah, that's going to waste time despite producing outputs more quickly as a first approximation. This is because the PR summaries implicate there are sequels or an appendix or other materials which are intended to resolve inconsistencies or conflicts which were included in a particular work as a joke or are otherwise unwelcome but there are dozens of them here from whatever consumable media materials are available to me.\n\nGoing into this sort of detailed response representation introduces material which contains factual errors, aspirational elements, by the nature of what I'd be quoting with special emphasis would only be half cooked or represent some other arbitrary entropy maximizing optimal solutions",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation.

Statement (C) is similar to statement (B), in that it seems to suggest that a competitive conflict for energy reserves is likely.\n6. There is no evidence of any 'liberal' perspective or any notion of international cooperation between players in the global system.\n7. Therefore the statement that fits the desired criteria for energy security would be statement (D), as it is the only one that has some element of international cooperation or free-market trading involved and therefore approaches the criteria of a liberal perspective on future energy security.\n8.

            "model_answer": "The criticism answer option is (D).\nLet me explain the following steps supported by reasoning to reach this answer:\nOne possible critique of any theory could be that it enables neo-colonialism. For their theory to be criticized, it should work against the theory purpose. The purpose of a Human security theory, as it differs from National security according to the Luck Mary Kaldor's theory description (source: Wikipedia), is \"focusing on the security needs of individuals and communities rather than the security of states\" and \"argued that the security concerns of people should shape national and international security policies\". .\nSince the main idea behind human security is focusing on individuals, any neo-colonial action would be against individuals or communities, and most likely will not resolve any of their security concerns.\nConclusion: If the human security was neo-colonial, it would intentionally or unintentionally fail to address the main goal of this theory, which is to focus on the security needs of individuals and communities, therefore it is impossible to be simultaneously neo-colonial and aligned with itself.\nThe criticism for Human security being neo-colonial is baseless. We can eliminate option (A).\nThe main goal of human security is to enhance the security of all individuals. If it is neoliberal or global capitalism, it may make some individuals richer, however will harm more individuals in a biggest proportion. According to the source, \"liberalism refers to liberal democracy with capitalist free-market economy and an adjunct legal system\". As a governance model, it tries to achieve prosperity through unfettered markets. It does not consider the inequality aspect, since inequality is self-addressing and markets will adjust.\nIt must be mentioned that individually, everyone would like their household to be in better income, however; this may force many others into poverty.

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",
