            "question": "Which State ordinarily exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels?\n\n(A) The coastal State\n(B) The flag State\n(C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction\n(D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "I would choose (A) The coastal State. My reasoning is based on the concept of sovereignty, where a coastal state has jurisdiction over activities occurring within its territorial waters, including crimes committed on board vessels. In addition,napart from constituting a threat to maritime safety, such crimes may cause damage to the coastal state's environment, economy, or society, making it necessary for the coastal state to exercise jurisdiction. Moreover, the presence of a vessel within territorial waters implies some measure of consent on the part of the coastal state. The detainment of a vessel would not only help to prevent further offenses by the perpetrator but would also serve as a warning to others who may be inclined to commit similar crimes within the same state's territorial waters. Finally, regarding option (C), while all states may enjoy limited jurisdiction over certain crimes, such as piracy, this option does not address the specific issue of crimes committed on board vessels within territorial waters. Option (B) the flag state, may have jurisdiction over its citizens, and option (D) the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, while important in addressing conflicts among states and ensuring compliance with maritime law, is not the primary authority in determining jurisdiction for crimes committed on board vessels. It is worth noting that failure to address this issue has ramifications for the safety and security of all states, particularly those with heavily trafficked coastal areas. Given that options (A), (B) and (C), and (D) have all been eliminated, the correct answer is option (D). The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea exercises jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels in territorial waters. Previous reasoning still holds.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first determine what the meaning of \"justiciability\" is. The term \"justiciability\" refers to the assessment of whether a particular matter can be decided or enforced by a court of law.\n\n(D) Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular right.\n\nHowever, the correct answer is actually (A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders. This definition of justiciability reflects the idea that a right can only be considered justiciable if there is a mechanism in place for enforcing that right. This typically involves the existence of a court or other entity that has the authority to hear and decide cases related to that right.\n\nIt is important to note that justiciability is not the same as the \"just nature or cause\" of a right, as stated in (B) Justiciability refers to the just nature or cause of a particular right. Instead, it refers to the ability of a court to enforce a right, which may or may not be related to its underlying justness or validity. Additionally, courts may not always enforce all legal rights, even though they may be considered justiciable, as reflected in (C) Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular right conforms to principles of justice. In these cases, the failure to enforce a right may simply reflect limited resources or other practical considerations.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C). Some reasoning:\n\n- One way (B) would be false because even by definition, R2P involves some call to the international community to respond, without needing it to be from the state itself though UNSC could alert to it if there is no such call. Humanitarian intervention not necessarily involving call for assistance, so this is not a valid difference.\n- Neither R2P nor humanitarian intervention could be a simple like-for-like dole since they are concepts that among other components enact different actions, outcomes of which are at their distinct perusal walks from application of each concept. For instance, say Libya with Gaddafi throughout his reign and subsequent intervention in 2011 might not be such an appropriate example for comparison, nor could comparison be made among Libya and others vis-a-vis their utility although commonalities rested in nature of responses they yielded. Preceding argument also invalidates template answer (A).\n- One potential valid  difference between humanitarian intervention and R2P lies in P5 veto powers. R2P as only (I) of element of responsibility to protect i.e. when state itself unwilling or unable, acknowledges as such by UNSC, recommends a range of possible measures for \u201ctimely and decisive response by the international community in order to halt or avert or respond to the unfolding of crisis the population is suffering through.\u201d R2P as only concept currently emphasizing on proactive responsibilities of international community, of canvassing state \u2018willingness\u2019 to see if they acknowledge the issue, whereas humanitarian intervention could be sheer military action from any altruistic quarter claiming to act in favour of those affected for whose welfare befalling on account of distress. R2P could also prescribe military action against claim of ability and willingness by the state when the UNSC agree with a qualified consensus to that recommendation but it struggles in face of UNSC vetoes due to various historic political compulsions of angles before P5, a nat",

            "model_answer": "(D) The so-called Lotus principle is that customary law derives from the combination of State practice and opinio juris (the opinion held by States that they are legally bound). This principle has been established through the landmark case of the PCIJ (1927) entitled \"Factory at Chorzow\" where the court laid down that in the case of legal disputes between different States, the decisions of tribunals will act as \"subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law\". This means that when there is a legal dispute between two or more States, the decisions of international courts such as the ICJ (International Court of Justice) will be used as a means for deciding the law concerned in that dispute. There are however, some exceptions to this; for example the Court will not consider provisions laid down by a special convention whereby the parties agree to abide by certain rules for conciliation. In addition, the PCIJ ruled that in order to establish the existence of a customary rule, State practice and opinio juris must be present. This is the essance of what is now referred to as the 'Lotus principle'. \n\nAnswer: D.",

There is, in the same way, an inherent prohibition of pronounced or unpronounced non-assistance to one of the parties and of non-recognition of a decision or award rendered in application of those means. This concept of non-assistance,[130] which is inherent in the concept of recognition of interim measures of protection (non-recognition of the decision of the arbitral tribunal indeclining such a measure abroad in consequence of denial thereof), is particularly stressed in Article XXVI of the Vienna Convention and incorporates a settlement of State responsibility.\n\n(B)",

However, this could not be found in the information provided. It is possible that the committee formation remains unchanged after Protocol 14.

However, one could generate a decent, minimally-informative algorithm:\n\n**Unfold answer choices and read them very closely, flagging \"islands\"**\n\n- The text states \"Rocks are islands that cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.\"\n- Application: For (A), (D), and (B), read the question after flagging each answer choice.\n- If the nearby reading takes place on an island within each answer choice, treat the optional threat as a fail.\n- Otherwise, continue.\n- Ie, Nothing unusual transpires in (C), so \"C\" is valid.\n- In contrast, arbitrary other somewhere allows both (A) and (B) to run through the question reading without a threat.\n- Nonetheless, (B) fails because it includes islands without mentioning the exceptions for those islands either in the definition of rocks (article 121(3)) or in the \"no-shelter\" step.  Note that checking for a definition except under special circumstances is invalid, but checking that an answer itself is amplified through a \"no-shelter\" (2nd reading) approach is allowed, albeit less than definitive.  Assume no compelled amplification of anything other than the answer itself.  If checking the answer for amplification fails, flag the answer based on the method for its question.\n- The rest of the answer choices can be immediately invalidated for failing to provide a typically unsatisfactory approach: we have here an island with one of 'A', 'B', or part of 'D' pretending to be a rock but appropriately alleging to lose its identity in the face of its own contradictory characterization as a Rock.  In the face of those contradictions, simply assume goodbye.\n\nIntuit Intuit then check the article for any assistance in generating a logical decision tree. With regard to pruning solution paths, re-read Article 121(3) closely in English to determine whether it addresses standing as either a disclaimer (an exception to the ordinary operation of Article 121) or disclaimee (a rule that applies to entities that are regulated independently of Article 121) in the scheme of things.\n\n* Disclaimer:\n\nAdjudicate the entire article's guidance to determine if a path through the best rule of inference in a compound hypothetical question should carry the day.\n\n* Send inference question for each tag in such a hypothetical: absent this tag, would you still assert the same method?
