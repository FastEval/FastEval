It is a term that is used to describe the limited scope of the legal system to address certain disputes or issues, and involves an assessment by the court of the legal validity, relevance, and justness of a particular right.\n\nA) The statement \"Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders\" is incorrect. While enforcement is an important aspect of justiciability, it only deals with the phase of addressing a legal right following its decision by a court.\nB) Justiciability, unlike the statement \"Justiciability refers to the just nature or cause of a particular right\" only deals with the ability of a court to make a decision based on the legal right, not the right itself.\nC) Although courts do determine whether non-enforcement of a particular right conforms to principles of justice when determining justiciability, it is not the meaning of justiciability. The statement \"Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular rights conforms to principles of justice\" is incorrect.\nD) Although Justiciability includes an assessment by the court of the obligation of a State to enforce a particular right, it is only one of several aspects included in justiciability.

            "question": "What is the 'Lotus principle'?\n\n(A) The so-called Lotus principle is that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', or, as it has been construed, 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law'\n(B) The so-called Lotus principle is that States are free to choose the Court that they will submit their disputes\n(C) The so-called Lotus principle is that States are not prohibited to assert their enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas\n(D) The so-called Lotus principle is that customary law derives from the combination of State practice and opinio juris",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Under the Lotus principle, it is believed that unless a restriction on States' independence is expressly prohibited, it is not presumed to exist in international law. In other words, States are free to act as they please, unless it is explicitly prohibited by a rule of international law. In the case of States submitting their disputes to the International Court of Justice, this means that they must have voluntarily accepted the Court's jurisdiction, otherwise the Court does not have the authority to hear and decide the case. The rationale behind this principle is to ensure that States have the freedom and autonomy to conduct their own affairs without outside interference, unless they voluntarily choose to subject themselves to the jurisdiction of an international body. For this reason, States' voluntary submission to ICJ jurisdiction is a key principle behind the Lotus decision and helps to ensure that the Court's authority is respected and upheld.\n\n(D) This text supports the Lotus principle. Customary international law is the body of rules that govern the behavior of States, and it is based on two main criteria: State practice and opinio juris. State practice refers to the actual behavior of States in their interactions with one another. Opinio juris, on the other hand, refers to the belief of States that they are bound by certain rules, even if they have not actually acted in accordance with those rules. If States consistently act in a particular way, and if they genuinely believe they are bound by certain rules, then those rules can become part of customary international law. The Lotus principle recognizes that States are not bound by a rule of international law unless it is explicitly prohibited or unless it has been accepted by the State in question. This approach ensures that the legal order is based on the free and voluntary behavior of States, and that the Court's authority rests on the consent of the parties to its jurisdiction.\n\n(A) There are some debates regarding the exact scope and nature of the Lotus principle.

This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The peaceful settlement of disputes is a crucial aspect of international law, as it aims to prevent conflicts from escalating into armed conflicts or wars.\n2. In accordance with Article 33(1) of the UN Charter, States are required to \"settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered\".\n3. This provision of the UN Charter reflects a general principle of international law on the peaceful settlement of disputes. It is worth noting that the obligation is to try to resolve disputes peacefully, not necessarily to resolve them.\n4. Option B (It is an obligation of conduct, ie States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means. This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes) is the correct answer, as it accurately reflects the obligation of States to engage in good faith negotiations, mediation or arbitration in attempts to peacefully resolve disputes.\n5. Option A (It is an obligation of result, that is, States are under a strict obligation to resolve their disputes as soon as possible) is incorrect, as the obligation is not to resolve disputes, but to seek peaceful means to resolve disputes.\n6. Option C (It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute) is incorrect, as the obligation is not a peremptory norm that cannot be derogated from under any circumstances, but rather a general principle of international law.\n7.

            "model_answer": "(C) Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights. The Commission of Human Rights was dissolved by Protocol 14 in favor of a new single-tier system.\n\nLet me explain:\n\n(A) and (B) are correct. Protocol 14 introduced several reforms in the functioning of the European Court of Human Rights. One of the main reforms was the change of the former three judge formation to a single judge formation. Protocol 14 also added a new criterion for admissibility. Applicants must first exhaust all domestic remedies before they can bring their case to the ECHR.\n\n(C) is also correct. Under the previous system, the Commission of Human Rights was responsible for examining complaints and deciding whether to bring a case before the Court. However, Protocol 14 eliminated the intermediary by establishing direct access to the Court. This means that individuals can file a complaint directly with the ECHR without going through the Commission. The Protocol also created a new disciplinary regime for judges, bringing greater transparency and accountability to the Court.\n\nThe answer is: (C) Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights.\n\nWe can express this answer by writing: (C)>(A),(B),(D). This means that (C) is true, and both (A) and (B) are true, but (D) is false. Protocol 14 did not extend the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights.

However, here's my step-by-step response:\n\nThis question appears to be asking about the definition of a 'rock' under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\n\nAccording to the definition in UNCLOS, a 'rock' is a naturally formed area of land that is surrounded by water and is not capable of sustaining human habitation or economic life of its own (source: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea).\n\nTherefore, option (C) seems to be the most appropriate definition for a 'rock' under UNCLOS. Please note that option (A) is not correct, as the size of an island is not relevant in defining whether it is considered a 'rock' under UNCLOS. Option (B) is also not entirely correct, as 'rocks' under UNCLOS are not defined by whether they have a maritime zone or not. Option (D) is not correct, as an island's ability to sustain human habitation is relevant in determining whether it is considered a 'rock' under UNCLOS.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n(C)\n\nIn paranthesis, the correct answer is:\n(C) Rocks are the islands which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and according to article 121 (3) have no Exclusive Economic Zone or continental shelf.",
