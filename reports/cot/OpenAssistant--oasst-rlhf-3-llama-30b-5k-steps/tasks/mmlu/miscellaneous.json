This narrows down the choices to (C) Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. It would not be likely for the Retail Merchants Association or the local chamber of commerce to provide credit ratings for retail businesses because their primary function is to represent the interests of retail businesses rather than provide financial information on them. The United States Retail Credit Association is also not likely to be a source of information on the credit rating of retail businesses because it is a trade association for the retail credit industry, rather than a provider of credit ratings or financial information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.",

Paper is made up of cellulose, which decomposes when heated above a certain temperature.\n2. The decomposition of cellulose produces a combustible gas, which can ignite when it reaches a sufficient concentration.\n3. The temperature at which cellulose decomposes and ignites is around 3985 degrees Fahrenheit.\n4. Therefore, (C) 3985 degrees is the correct answer.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Copper has a relatively low mass and thus absorbs less energy from temperature changes. The process of absorbing energy causes the material to expand or contract which can potentially damage the circuitry. Due to its relatively low mass copper has little potential energy stored in the material and is thus less affected by temperature and only experiences minor expansions/contract or deformations.\n(B) Carbon is a unique material that is influenced by temperature changes via its conductivity. Carbon can contain various states of charge that can alter its resistance, however this occurs at a fairly slow rate. For this reason carbon can be placed in a separate category since it is not primarily influenced by its mechanical properties.\n(C) Germanium has a coefficient of expansion that is high when compared to Copper. Similarly to Copper it is also not influenced by external forces. \n(D) Silicon has similar coefficient of expansion to Germanium and is influenced by temperature changes since it is constantly under tension which affects any circuitry built upon it.\n\nTherefore (A) Copper has a LEAST affected resistance  by temperature changes because its property of having low mass helps avoid damage induced by expansion/contraction.\n\n(A) (B) (D) (C)",
