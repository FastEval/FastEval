            "model_answer": "Answer: (C) 135 pm, 523 kJ/mol\n\nReasoning:\n\n* First, we need to bring out some important information about ionization energy:\n* First ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove one electron from an atom, thereby turning it into a cation plus one valence electron.\n* One element that requires attention is that, with the increase of nuclear charge, the ionization energy also increases (generally speaking).\n* Thus, which option would be more likely with the relatively higher first ionization energy 1086 kJ/mol?\n(C) Option (C), basically due to the following reasons:\n* Qualitatively, if option (A), 70 pm, is significantly smaller than the given atomic radius 77 pm (about 8.1 % smaller), then the subtraction of one electron would probably lead to a larger radius than 77 pm, which is not reasonable, since a cation usually is smaller than the corresponding atom.\n* Based on the same argument, option (D), 40 pm, is also not very likely.\n* Option (B), 86 pm, is too close to the given radius 77 pm, which is not very promising either.\n* It seems a good idea to focus on option (C).\n* Then, we try to figure out what effect removing one electron would bring about, bringing the atomic radius back to about 135 pm.\n* One possible explanation could be that the unpaired electrons existing at the outermost energy level take up more space than are classically allocated when just considering electron clouds when there are available energy slots to be filled.\n* Since option (C) contains one unpaired electron arrangement, it is more likely to be the answer.\n* So the answer is option (C).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(B) nonpolar covalent bonding\n\nThe given chemical signature consisting of high melting point, poor conductivity, and insolubility in water is most likely nonpolar covalent bonding. High melting point indicates strong intermolecular forces and that the particles are held together through strong bonds. Polar covalent bonding is characterized by electrons being more strongly attracted to one atom more than the other. Therefore, since there is only one example here, I infer that this rule is violated. Ionic bonds involve charged atoms, so that clearly isn't it either. So it's likely (B). I can't think of anything that violates these rules except nonpolar covalent bonding. Perhaps the intermolecular forces could also involve other particles besides the given chemical signature, but then again, those particles likely also involve (B).\n\nIs (B) nonpolar covalent bonding correct? Monoammonium phosphate is an odorless white crystalline powder and its chemical formula is NH4H2PO4 due to being in an aquatic environment. If not, then I will reclassify reaction details using better information before doubting myself. Something else is at play here besides my knowledge of the given chemical signature and facts.

We can use the idea of partial pressure to find the partial pressure of nitrogen. The partial pressure of a gas is the pressure it would exert if it were present in the container alone.\n4. We need to find the number of moles of nitrogen. We can use the formula: pressure = n*R*T, where n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.

            "model_answer": "To determine the answer to this question, it is necessary to:\n\n1. Review the definition of a monatomic ion. A monatomic ion is an ion having only a single atom, which carries a net electrical charge.\n\n2. Recognize that the representative elements in the question refer to the chemical elements that are used to represent the groups of elements in the periodic table. These elements tend to display the general properties of the elements in their respective groups.\n\n3. Consider which of the statements (A)-(D) is the most likely to be correct based on the properties of monatomic ions and the representative elements.\n\n4. Recognize that option (A) refers to the solubility of monatomic ions, and that many monatomic ions are highly soluble in solvents.\n\n5. Consider, however, that the solubility of monatomic ions can depend on a variety of factors, such as the specific ion and the type of solvent. Therefore, this option cannot be considered a definitive property of monatomic ions.\n\n6. Consider option (B), which refers to the electronegativity of monatomic ions. Electronegativity is a chemical property that refers to the ability of an atom or ion to attract electrons to itself in a chemical bond. Some representative elements, such as Fluorine (F), are highly electronegative.\n\n7. Recognize, however, that the electronegativity of monatomic ions can depend on a variety of factors, such as the specific ion and the electron configuration of the element. Therefore, option (B) does not apply to all monatomic ions.\n\n8. Consider option (C), which refers to the isoelectronic relationship between monatomic ions and noble gases. Isoelectronic species are species that have the same number of electrons in the same shells. Some monatomic ions, such as Nitrogen (N), can be isoelectronic with noble gases.\n\n9. Recognize that this option can be applicable to some monatomic ions, but may not apply to all.\n\n10. Consider option (D), which refers to the tendency for monatomic ions to exhibit colors when excited. Some monatomic ions, such as Metals in groups IIIA and VB, exhibit strong colors.\n\n11. Recognize that this option is applicable to some monatomic ions. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).
