It depends on the model choice, assumptions, and the underlying data distribution.\n\nFor statement 2, it is True. The technology in AdaBoost assigns non-negative coefficients to avoid overfitting and handle multi-class problems without a large amount of training examples. It is a common property of AdaBoost-based algorithms. So, the statement is always True.\n\nBased on the explanations, the answer is (D) False, True.\n\nPlease note that this is just one possible explanation, and any AT will not provide peripheral knowledge. If the domain knowledge and context are limited, the AT may not be able to provide detailed reasoning or accurate answers.

Statement 1 implies that SVMs give a probability distribution over the possible labels for an input example, just like logistic regression models.\n\nStep 2: Statement 2 suggests that the support vectors of a given SVM model should remain the same (or at least not change significantly) while using different types of kernels. In other words, the support vectors should not change as we switch from a linear kernel to a higher-order polynomial kernel.\n\nStep 3: Now, let's analyze each statement and determine whether it is true or false.\n\n(A) Statement 1 is true: SVMs give a probability distribution over the possible labels for an input example. This implies they are suitable for classification tasks.\n\n(B) Statement 2 is mostly false: When moving from a linear kernel to a higher-order polynomial kernel, the support vectors can change. This is because the linear kernel is a special case of polynomial kernels. The support vectors can be affected by the degree of the polynomial used in the kernel function.\n\nStep 4: Based on our analysis from Step 3, we can form our answer to the given question. The answer is:\n\n(C) True, False.\n\nIt should be noted that the support vectors can also remain the same or change due to regularization or other factors.
