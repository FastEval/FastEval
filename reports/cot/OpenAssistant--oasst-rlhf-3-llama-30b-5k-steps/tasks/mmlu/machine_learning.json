The expectation maximization algorithm iterates over two steps: Expectation step, which estimates the unobserved states or the model parameters, based on the observed data and the previous estimates, and Maximum Likelihood or the M step, which maximizes the likelihood\nof the data. However, generally, it can't be guaranteed that the log-likelihood of the data will increase through successive iterations as the M\nstep only locally maximizes the likelihood function.

In gradient descent, the update rule is given by:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - alpha * g\n\nwhere x_n is the current estimate of the parameters, g is the gradient of the cost function with respect to x, and alpha is the learning rate.\n\nThe cost of this update depends on the size of the data set N and the dimension of the parameters D. Without knowing the specific implementation of the gradient descent algorithm or the cost function being optimized, it is difficult to provide a more exact answer. However, we can make some general observations about the cost of this update.\n\nFirst, the computation of the gradient requires computing the cost function for all N data points, which takes O(ND) time.\n\nSecond, the update rule involves a simple matrix vector multiplication, which takes O(D^2) time for a dense matrix.\n\nTherefore, the overall cost of one gradient descent update can be expressed as O(ND+D^2).

Decision trees are actually learned by minimizing some objective function, typically called the impurity. This objective function varies depending on the type of decision tree and the problem being addressed. The Gini Index and Entropy are the most common impurity functions used. For example, the Gini Index measures the proportion of the instances in a node that are assigned to a certain class, while Entropy measures the uncertainty of the output.
