The recall will show that the corporation is taking responsibility for its product and will help to restore consumer confidence.

            "model_answer": "(D) When public relations uses opinion poll results to generate support for a particular issue does not best describe the 'spiral of silence'.\n\n(A) When victims of abuse remain silent about the abuse: The 'spiral of silence' refers to a theory in communication studies that explains why people tend to remain silent if their opinions differ from the majority view. The theory does not apply to victims of abuse, who may remain silent due to other underlying causes.\n\n(B) When people with controversial opinions remain silent if they believe their minority opinion will not be acceptable: The 'spiral of silence' theory proposes that people with minority opinions tend to remain silent, as social norms and political context can discourage them from expressing their views. The theory also suggests that those with controversial or dissenting views are more likely to keep their opinions to themselves to avoid ridicule, rejection, and exclusion.\n\n(C) When people hide their opinions if they do not agree with the majority: People tend to keep their opinions to themselves if they believe their opinions differ from the majority view, which contributes to the 'spiral of silence.' The theory does not necessarily apply directly to close peer or family members, although their views may influence the opinions of others.\n\n(D) When public relations uses opinion poll results to generate support for a particular issue: The 'spiral of silence' theory is concerned with how people privately express their opinions, not how public relations or opinion poll results influence perceptions or support for a particular issue.\n\nAnswer: (C) When people hide their opinions if they do not agree with the majority.\n(Parenthesis: (C).)",
