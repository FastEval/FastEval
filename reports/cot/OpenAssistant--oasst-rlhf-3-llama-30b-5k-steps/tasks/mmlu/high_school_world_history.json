By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

The passage discusses the development and use of gunpowder weapons in both Western Europe and China during the 1200s through the 1400s.\n2. It explains that in Western Europe, governments invested in the experimentation and improvement of gunpowder weapons because they were useful in protracted sieges, while in China, the main threat came from highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons were unwieldy and of little use.\n3. Therefore, the development and use of gunpowder weapons in both Western Europe and China was influenced by the specific cultural, social, and military context of each society, which shaped the way governments and military leaders prioritized and invested in certain technologies.\n4. This shows that the way societies shared strategically important technologies with each other was influenced by the specific context of each society and the threats they faced, as well as the resources they had available to invest in improving and using these technologies.\n5.

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists.

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",

            "model_answer": "First of all, we must understand the context of this question. The Cawnpore Massacre was a series of brutal actions taken by the Indian rebels against the British during the Indian Mutiny of 1857. The mutiny was a reaction to years of British colonial oppression in India, which had both cultural and economic effects on the local population. The established British presence in India, as described in the first passage, had a monopoly on violence, seeing themselves as superior to the natives.\n\nNow, let's consider the given options:\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n\nThis answer is incorrect as it suggests that the massacres were justifiable under any circumstances. Furthermore, it ignores the fact that the violence was not only against British soldiers but also against women, children, and civilians, which is unjustifiable under any circumstances.\n\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n\nThis answer is correct as it highlights the effect of decades of British colonialism in India (as mentioned by Russell) and the revolt as a reaction to the oppressive rule.\n\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n\nThis answer is neither correct nor relevant as the massacres cannot be praised or justified, as it caused immense suffering and harmed innocent people (as mentioned by Mukherjee).\n\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\n\nThis answer is incorrect as the violence emerged as an element of reaction in response to the oppression, rather than a premeditated conspiracy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nWhat is the answer for the given question?\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\nWhat does the answer B imply?\n\nAnswer B implies that the Cawnpore Massacre was a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India. It shows that the Indian natives viewed the British as tyrants and oppressors, and the revolt of 1857 was their way of resisting and opposing the colonial power.
