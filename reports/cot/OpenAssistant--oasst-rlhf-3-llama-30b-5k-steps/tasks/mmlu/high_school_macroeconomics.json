From this it can be inferred that\n\n(A) inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus.\n(B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n(C) aggregate supply decreased.\n(D) aggregate demand is steeply sloped.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n\nTo see why, consider what an expansionary fiscal policy is. It refers to a situation where the government increases its spending or cuts taxes in order to boost aggregate demand and increase economic activity. When the government increases its spending or cuts taxes, it increases the amount of money in circulation, which leads to an increase in aggregate demand.\n\nNow, consider what a large increase in real output and a small increase in the price level suggest. They suggest that there was some unemployed resources in the economy that could be brought back into use to meet the increased demand without causing inflation.\n\nPutting it all together, we can concluded that the initial economy had some unemployed resources, which is a characteristic of a recessionary gap. The expansionary fiscal policy was able to bring these resources back into use, which is a characteristic of an inflationary gap. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.",

The increase in aggregate demand is likely to stimulate economic activity, leading to an increase in real GDP and an increase in the price level, as more commodities are also likely to be produced in response to this change.\nThat said, fluctuations in either supply or demand in the real world are often difficult, if not impossible to quantify with perfect precision.

When the nominal interest rate falls, it makes saving in money accounts less attractive for households. Households may choose to hold more money (or liquid assets like cash) as a means to store value and for transactional purposes. The demand for money therefore increases, causing a leftward shift in the money demand curve.

This seems to be a desirable outcome but doesn't necessarily equate to allocative efficiency since it could also mean that no superior products are being produced as a result of less competition.\n2.
