            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation. The symptoms of tingling and numbness in the left thigh are consistent with compression of this nerve, which runs near the inguinal ligament. The patient's history of recent hospitalization for a pulmonary embolism and placement of an IVC filter, as well as a hematoma that was resolving on discharge, could have resulted in external pressure on the nerve. In addition, the improvement of symptoms over the past week could suggest that the pressure is being alleviated, further supporting this diagnosis. Other options such as cerebral infarction and complications of the IVC filter placement are less likely given the patient's normal vital signs and examination findings.",

She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours.

            "model_answer": "To arrive at the correct diagnosis for this patient, we need to consider the available information and clinical symptoms. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of my reasoning:\n\n1. The patient is a 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female admitted to the hospital at 39 weeks' gestation with active labor.\n2. She was initially having regular contractions every 4 minutes but now has only a few intermittent and weak contractions. Provides 4 loose nappies against 6 hours; says the baby was moving well up until 4 hours ago.\n3. Her examination reveals a fetal head that is engaged, intact membranes, normal fetal heart tones, and a completely effaced and 7 cm dilated cervix.\n4. Considering this information, we need to determine the most likely cause of her irregular and weak contractions. Braxton Hicks contractions, lower uterine retraction ring, and hypotonic uterine dysfunction can be ruled out as they do not explain her symptoms.\n5. 4 loose nappies against 6 hours; says the baby was moving well up until 4 hours Provides 4 loose nappies against 6 hours; says the baby was moving well up until 4 hours ago.\n6. Her complaint of the baby slowing down Provides 4 loose nappies against 6 hours; says the baby was moving well up until 4 hours ago. combined with her recent pain medication use and intermittent contractions suggest primary dysfunctional labor is the most likely diagnosis.\n7. Answer: D) Primary dysfunctional labor.\n8. Explanation:Primary dysfunctional labor is a rare cause of maternal and perinatal death, which is characterized by early onset; continuation of labor despite failure of cervical dilation; persistent fetal bradycardia after institution of standard measures to treat associated hypovolemia; and absent or severe perinatal asphyxia despite apparent fetal viability at the onset of labor. Hypovolemia is managed initially with IVsolutions such as 0.9%saline and frequently recurring administration of oxytocin. Fetal distress must be managed based on its severity. There is little experience with cesarean delivery for dysfunction a",
