This means we'll have 7 coefficients in our polynomial.\n7 coefficients - 1 = 6 coefficients in the original polynomial.\n\nWe'll put those 6 coefficients and derivatives in a matrix which has dimensions 7x6 (7 rows, 6 columns). Action of the operator D is performed as left multiplication by a 6x7 matrix.

By substituting x=8/x and y=(8/x)^2 in the distance formula, we get:\n      \u221a[(x-8/x)^2]=[(8/x)^2-0^2 ]=16/\u221ax^3\n\n4.

The total number of ways to choose 3 suitcases out of 25 is given by 25!/(3! * 22!), which simplifies to 25 * 24 * 23 = 12,775.\n2. To get the number of ways with exactly 2 damaged suitcases, we need to count the number of combinations of 2 damaged suitcases out of the 5 damaged suitcases. This is given by 5!/(2! * 3!), which simplifies to 5 * 4 = 20.\n3. We multiply the number of ways to select 3 suitcases with the number of ways to have exactly 2 damaged suitcases: 20 * 12,775 = 255,500.\n4. Now we need to divide this number by the total number of possible ways to select 3 suitcases, which is given by 25!/(3! * 22!), as calculated in step 1. 255,500 / 12,775 = 21.

If we move the bottom end of the ladder away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, the top end of the ladder will slide downward along the wall.\n3. Our task is to find out how fast the top end of the ladder will be sliding downward when the top end is 3 meters above the ground.\n4. To solve this problem, we need to use the distance formula and trigonometry. We can set up an equation with the variables we have: the length of the ladder (L), the angle the ladder makes with the ground (theta), and the distance between the bottom end of the ladder and a point 3 meters above the ground (h).\n5. We can use trigonometry to solve for the value of the angle theta. We know that the length of the ladder and the height at which the top end of the ladder is 3 meters above the ground must form a right triangle.\n6. Since we know that the length of the ladder is 9 meters, and the height at which the top end of the ladder is 3 meters above the ground is 9 sin(theta), we can solve for theta by dividing each term by 9, such that 9 meters / (9 sin(theta)) = 9 meters / 9 theta = 1 meter / theta = 9.\n7. So the value of the angle theta is 9. And we can plug this value into the equation for the distance formula, which is d = L * sin(theta). We know that L = 9 meters and theta = 9, so d = 9 * sin(9) = 0.64.\n8. We can also plug this value into the velocity equation, which is v = d / t, where d is the distance moved and t is the time it took to move that distance. We are not given the time it took for the top end of the ladder to move 3 meters downward, but since we are given that the bottom end of the ladder is moving away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, we can say that the top end of the ladder is moving downward at a constant rate of 2*sin(9).

P is invertible.\nAn invertible linear transformation is one-to-one and onto, meaning it maps every element to a unique element of the same vector space and vice versa. If P were invertible, then for any v in V, there would exist a unique w such that P(w) = v. However, we know that P^2 = P, which means any vector v is mapped by P to a vector that is then mapped by P to v again. Therefore, the only possible output of P would be the zero vector. This contradicts the one-to-one nature of invertibility (unique output for each input), so P cannot be invertible.\n\nII. P is diagonalizable.\nA diagonalizable linear transformation is one that can be written as a diagonal matrix after some change-of-basis transformation. If P were diagonalizable, we could write it as a diagonal matrix D, and then (P^2 = P) would mean that D^2 = D. But this is not possible for any real-valued diagonalizable transformation, as a diagonal matrix cannot have equal diagonal elements in more than one row/column. So P is not diagonalizable.\n\nIII.
