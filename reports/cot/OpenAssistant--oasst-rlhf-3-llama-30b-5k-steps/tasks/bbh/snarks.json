The use of the phrase \"that's what keeps it okay\" is an exaggeration, as racism is clearly not okay. The speaker is mocking the idea that being racist is acceptable by saying the opposite. This statement is an example of verbal irony, as the speaker's words convey a meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite.\n\n(B) Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it toxic.\nThis statement is also sarcastic, but it expresses the opposite message. The speaker claims that they are only \"memeing\" about being racist, which means they are not being serious and are only joking. However, the use of the word \"toxic\" in this context is another way of saying that the joke is not acceptable or funny, as \"toxic\" implies something that is harmful ordestructive. The speaker is effectively criticizing the idea that it is acceptable to make jokes about racism, but they are using irony and sarcasm to convey their message.\n\nIn conclusion, both options contain sarcastic statements, but their meaning is different. Option (A) is making a mocking comment about the acceptability of racism.

He didn't threaten, he only urged; totally different: This statement could be seen as literal and direct. The speaker is simply making a statement telling that the other person did not threaten but urged. This interpretation does not convey sarcasm.\n2. He didn't threaten, he only urged; totally different: The speaker may be trying to convey sarcasm, but it is difficult to determine the tone or context in which this statement was made.\n\n(B) He didn't threaten, he only pleaded; totally different.\nThis statement can also be understood in two ways:\n1.

He didn't threaten, he only pleaded;totally different: Admittedly, quite frequently, while trying to plead to prevent something, people might cut-off the recipient by saying, \"or else\", for instance, when saying \"I plead you stop this now and don't do it, or else\". So this statement may also be considered as sarcastic if the speaker made such additional comments during their pleading that would be considered as threat.\n\nIn conclusion, it is difficult to determine which statement is sarcastic based on the information provided without considering additional context or tone.\n\nA B.

Dumpstering a phone onBad battery life is also unlikely especially if it's less than ; 6 months old. This is especially true if the  phone was over $1000 (as stated the phone cost $1000)\n\nthe likelihood nwould be comparable tocase  A) an employee of a fine dine restaurant simly threw away a steak that was half cooked through and when askedwas counseled that it would be better to serve the guest remaining side of the steak that was overcooked. For another analogy assume it is summer, most of the vehicles get serviced with a generator and the servicemen through away the radiator fluid for the servuced vehicles in the hands of the homeless. \nThis answer is also true only till  (ignoring other externalities and assuming fantastical behaviour of the philanthropic servicemen)Although colour is green and yellow are not green, but green begets yellow(for Ash plant) and yellow begets green, other scenarios although exist i.e such as the A/C running without any input, or answer (A) the battery depleting fast andby an act of random chance by service centre either good battery or a tantalum unit, however the answer (A) might bring into limelight(initially) \"petty deserving of admission into business university\" portions of of the manager as well as the actiivity. The other answers bar answer ( A) will too bring behaviour conscientious of people.the service mwrkers with answer(B) the homeless that took those radiators were subjected to poverty so they hide some material from them from the surrounding dumpers and other people.In answer C the store clerks are bent on making the company bad, which is far away from their goal, and thus also caters towards the(A), hence answer remains A. But when it comes to answer (D) you need to think, intuit the explain, intuit the qeustion now. Whilst intuiting you do consider previous intuiton, a similar thoughtwill then ignite onto your intuitive  plce but wanting just Pennsylvanias IN laduents lock itself the locked IEEE of a worthless computer and no consideration maker has, so the lady mush have been poverty stricken. This is now not exactly needed, answer (A) is still correct. the argument was to tell that PBAB has different connotaton more often the case. So, if a company takes answer (D), carrying forward the situastion in example, the tata nano authority takes it into consideration and massively advertises these. Consi der, it doesn't necessarily look beautiful nor even more presentable in terms of service it gives. If the company and most the company will lose esteem it holds. It's a difficult decision to choose for the company by professing answer(D) infront of it's com\u0639emed rivals.When you look at  addressing answer (E), an replacing for $150 might be a good choice but, a yearly renewal cost is too much, which can be accepted but very less likely.This whole conclusive results for most of the scenarios aimed at answer (A), although a perfect score of 100 can't be assigned to all of them, provision, except for answer (A), don't at any point or condition upholdconviction in them or bring a place for orientation of another company, thus if a point is generated at start of E, which is typically towards answer (C) then this whole answer will be answer (A)((althoughgey are not direct like liar,tree beings with a green shoot)) Although green is not yellow yet green brings  along yellow which is a part of green doesm't it? all answer but (A) trfy to convince you answering answer(A) but(D) is rather fortuitous but not the final one, the other answers that are not answer (A) are giving you more often only areferral to(A) but(A) is both (A) it gives you the chance of a bad decision because those answer give you only  reference validate against answer (A), the group shows your ability of tactual knowledge",

In this statement, the speaker expresses the opinion that violence is the solution to a problem, which is likely to be viewed by most people as excessively extreme, and potentially dangerous to both the person using violence and those around them.\n\n(B) Exercise is a perfect way to unleash your frustrations.\n\nThis statement expresses a sentiment that is generally perceived as positive and healthy. Exercise is a well-established way to reduce stress and tension, and to release stored-up energy and emotion in a safe and productive way.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that statement (A) is likely to be sarcastic, while statement (B) is not.
