So only 2 penguins in table, but one of them is deleted, so it's 2 in delete table.\nAfter viewing information in cell with height of penguin I realized Bernard was deleting after his other information was viewed. That leaves 2 penguin. Which is the same as original answer as only 1 penguin was deleted after their information was viewed as I used to determine delete penguin from Typo answer. So to expand this answer to include Bernard, as he was treated as deleted after enough of his other information outside of heights cell and the other info being the same as another penguin. For \"normal\" interpretation of deleted(values in table put there by user but not penguin and there because penguin missing some information because user didn't enter it or entered random data by mistake) this is the answer 1 little penguin named Bernard is in middle of table, so there is 2 regular penguins in table (not counting the deleted Bernard). Then there deleted 1 penguin and the other 3 penguin didn't exits in the table! That deleting 1 penguin left 0 penguins in table.

This is because all the penguins who were younger than Bernard are now one place to the left in the table. In other words, Vincent and Gwen became one place to the left.\n5. Based on this, the answer to the question: which is the youngest penguin? Is Vincent.\n6. This is because Vincent used to be at position (1,4), and when Bernard was removed, he became at position (0,4).\n7. An instance of this is as follows:\n\t* Bernard\n\t* (D) Vincent\n\t* (A) Louis\n\t* Gwen\n8. The answer is therefore: (C) Vincent.\n9.
