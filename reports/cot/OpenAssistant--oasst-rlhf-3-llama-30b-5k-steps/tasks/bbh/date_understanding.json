Christmas Eve of 1937 was on the Julian calendar.\n\nIt is known that March 1, 1937 in the USSR used the Julian calendar. However, when the USSR switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1937, they skipped the day of March 1 and went straight to May 1, 1937, therefore jumping over April.\n\nJan 1, Oct 1 ( Julian ) = Mar 1, Dec 1 ( Gregorian ) = Mar 1, Dec 1 ( USSR, Julian ), thus: Jan 4 1938 - Mar 1, 1938 = 7 months.\n\nApr 1, Sep 21, Dec 2 1937 - Mar 1, 1938 = 7 months.\n\nAs for Dec 25, 1937 - Mar 1, 1938 = 9 months, therefore (C) 01/04/1938 is the correct answer.\n\nTomorrow is 01/04/1938.

            "model_answer": "There are at least three different ways to understand this question:\n\n1- If it is interpreted literally, appointments with 5 people is not possible. Certainly appointments with one or more people could be possible. 5 people is curiously an odd number. Without more context it is reasonable to assume that 1) it is an error and should have been 5 people. This gives the answer to be (E) 07/01/1972\n2- If item (3) is inclusive, then the answer is either (A) 07/09/1979 or (E)07/01/1972. Answer B is March 1st so it is not valid as 12/01/1972 is not an anniversary. Answer (C) is not between June 3oth and today, the same is true for Answer (D). Answer (F) is not below today's date. Answer (A), given the date provided is less than July 2nd, gives the answer (A) 07/09/1972\n3- Another reasonable assumption that we can make is by considering the word appointment. An appointment is a calendar entry and as such they tend ( at least in our modern era of digital calendars) to be created or deleted with the click of a button or from a menu. Suggesting that someone would have accidentally created an extra appointment which is not what we considered in a previous analysis seems like a stretch.\n\nSince it is likely inconvenient for Jane to make the people attend on a single day, we can reasonably assume that (E)07/01/1972 is the answer. Potentially further context might reveal that it took time to gather the extra people to make up an even number, and the scheduled appointments were rescheduled in order to make it happen so as to not inconvenience others, but without more context, we should assume that is not the case.\n\nThe answer to all three questions is likely:\n(E) 07/01/1972\n\nNote: Some calendars see Jan 1st on the next day as Monday and if that is the case, then all dates should be shifted by one day. For example, 07/01/1972 being a Monday, would make it so that 06/30/1972 was on a Sunday. This case would then eliminate the analysis in option 2 being valid.\nObviously: There was not any information provided on who Jane was or who scheduled the appointments with her or anything about the nature or reason behind the appointment. Context which provides information about some of those questions would be helpful for determining what one SHOULD have done, and would provide opportunity to answer better. Is this schedule even relevant to a problem is also susceptible to doubt before some supplemental context is provided. Note there are conflicting assumptions which would have likely required difficult to make given the date provided. Seeking more context to tease out the answer is another reasonable approach. \n\nWithout a social stigma, why could Jane schedule three appointments with 5 poeple for tomorrow (Tue, 7/9/1972). Presumably this means three different appointments at one minute in between the start/stop times. Suggest other potential answers. This lacks context and relies on potentially questionable assumptions, for example, that 1) Jane has 3 time slots allocated to her for appointments tomorrow, or that 2 appropriate slots were left un reserved. However using digital calendars seems common.\nDoes Jane's profession somehow overlap with making appointments for lots of people? Is tomorrow Tue, 7/9/1974 and the answer is (E) 07/01/1972?\n\nThere is not a good answer without more information.\n\nJane is likely short for a given name and it probably is a national language version of the name. Given the date, the name might be associated to different ethnic groups from the US.\nBased on some unstated additional premises and axioms, perhaps the possible answers to most of the questions would be better. The question is valid and thought provoking and falls in the realm of interesting questions, perhaps only in addressing the current contextual premises, the answers would be better, otherwise.\nIn the context of one interpretation:\n- Jane is presumed to be a person with a probably**, although arbitrarily, 3 open appointment slots tomorrow.\n- We assumed that her profession associated with her name is not overlapping.\n- That the",

            "model_answer": "(D) 01/12/2018\n\nSo, why is the answer (D) 01/12/2018? Here are the steps:\n\n1. Remember that today is the first Monday of 2019, so January 7th 2019 is a Saturday ( S ). If we go back 7 - 1 = 6 days we end up on the first day of the week which is a Sunday (S).\n\n2. The first day of the year 2019 is on a Tuesday, so to find the day of the week a year before (which is January 7th 2018) we'd have to look for a similar day in the previous year. SO if today is a Saturday (S), and we go a year back in time, we end up three spots down in the week wheel, to be precise on a Friday ( F ).\n\n3. Now we look for Monday, to find out what day January 7th was. If we go from Friday to Monday we can follow either of these two paths: move three spots right to Tuesday, and then three more spots to finally land on Monday. Alternatively one could just go two spots to Wednesday and then two more spots to Thursday, and in the end from Thursday two more spots to Monday. Both paths would work out fine and lead to the answer:\n\n(D) 01/07/2018 ---> (S) 01/12/2018. We don't have to worry about January 1st or 2nd here, because those days are in a different year. So we can summarize this deduction by saying that January 7th is a Saturday, or in general coming back through time the date will go ( S ) < (F) < (D).\n\n4. To spell out the answer A) 01/08/2018, B) 01/07/2018, C) 01/02/2018 clearly satisfy the first requirement.\n\nTo check option E) 05/07/2017 first we observation that there is exactly one day between 01/08 and 01/07, similarly there is exactly one day between 01/02 and 05/07, so the calculations just check out. However both options are not correct because coming through time is not reflected in the superscript and subscript notation, so this leaves us with only three other options.\n\nNext we consider option F) 10/29/2017. Clearly it matches the parenthesis requirement of starting with a Saturday, but we still have to check our laboured conclusion above by showing that just like for B it applies to F too.) F > D > C > B ---> option F) is also correct.\n\nHowever in the F > D case the only competition came from B, and there is actually another angle from which we can look at it that point, i.e. when we follow the steps: F > S > B not noticed at first:\n\nF > Th Friday --> S > Tue Wed --> R Sat, or: F > Wed FOUR spots to Tuesday. It is worth mentioning that while it looks unrelated, ob the options list we have five days of a week that must correspond to exactly one of the possibilities.\n\nAnd since we wanted to check if D > B, and only now notice that D = Wed lies RIGHT BETWEEN the Sat and B!!\nThrowing the option on top (D Mar 29th) will make R move to that position, and five days back from there we arrive exactly to F, B, or C equally likely since they close the diamond in the middle. So now the positions of the options checked so far are:\n\nD, B, F (rom administrative point of view D and B would be taken and F would be the shortestlooking answer, so we throw one more into the mix) and \n\n(E) F July 22nd 2017. Quick check. One FC too many > bad direction: there seems to be AND, OR applied rule in the game we don't want. We see immediately however that E is correct. Now with the positions of D and B marked, from here we see that Mar 29th is between B Friday and Sat. Seeing as initially we found that D Mar 29th > B Sat, we can\n\nAND (R Wed < D Sun) and (R Wed > B Fri/ Sat) > R",
