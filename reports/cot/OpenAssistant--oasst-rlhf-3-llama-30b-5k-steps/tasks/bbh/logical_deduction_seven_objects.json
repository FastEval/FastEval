            "model_answer": "Here is the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n* The paragraph mentions that there are seven fruits, and gives their names: \"mangoes, watermelons, peaches, kiwis, oranges, cantaloupes, and plums\".\n* It says the watermelons are the \"cheapest\", so its position is at one end of the cost spectrum; let's say cheapest is 1, so watermelons are \"1\" here.\n* It says the peaches are more expensive than the mangoes. Since the watermelon is the cheapest, this means the peaches have a higher cost than \"1\", so let's say they are \"2\".\n* The paragraph mentions that the cantaloupes are the second-most expensive, and since the peaches are more expensive then the mangoes, but less expensive than the plums, this means that cantaloupes are higher than \"2\", but below \"5\". Let's say their cost is \"3\", since there are only 6 options listed (including cheapest and most expensive) before \"5\".\n* It says the oranges are more expensive than the cantaloupes, which means that oranges have a cost above \"3\". Let's say their cost is \"4\".\n* Now we can look at the last cost, which must be the most expensive fruit-- the plums. We know from the paragraph that the peaches are less expensive than the plums, so their cost must be above \"4\", and there is only one option left, \"5\".\n* Now that we know all the face values, we can count through the possible answers. Answer (A) contradicts the text because it says mangoes are most expensive, not cheapest, and answers (B) and (C) contradict the text because it says watermelon and peach are cheaper, respectively; likewise with answers (E) and (F) for oranges and cantaloupes. Answer (D) gives the correct cost for kiwis, which is cheapest. Answer (G) is the option for plums, which are most expensive, so answer (G) is correct.\n* Answer: (G) The plums are the third-most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the paragraph states that the plums are the third-most expensive fruit, makingAnswer (G) correct. All other options related to oranges, kiwis, mangoes, watermelons, and cantaloupes-- which, respectively, constituted options (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E). Since none of these constituted the correct answer, these options are incorrect. Answer (G) alone constitutes the correct answer. Since this answer is correct, \"G\" is the answer.",

            "correct_answer": "(A)",
            "model_answer": "(B) The cardinal is the fourth from the left.\n\nTo determine the position of each bird, we start with the cardinal and follow its position iteratively to determine the position of the other birds. Since the cardinal is the fourth from the left, the raven (to the left of the cardinal) is the third from the left. The raven, in turn, determines the positions of the other birds. Since the falcon is to the left of the blue jay, the falcon is the second from the left (to the left of the raven). The falcon determines the positions of the quail and the robin, which are to its left, making them fifth and sixth from the left, respectively. We now know the positions of six of the seven birds: the raven third from the left, the cardinal fourth, the falcon second, the blue jay third, the owl fifth, and the quail sixth. Implying that the robin is the seventh from the left (to the right of the quail). \n\nThe answer is: (G) The robin is the seventh from the left. The answer is a single letter: \"G\".\n\nWe now know that the position of each bird is as follows, from left to right:\nRaven: 3\nCardinal: 4\nFalcon: 2\nBlue Jay: 5\nOwl: 7\nQuail: 6\nRobin: 7\n\nFor each statement, we apply the inverse logic in reverse order to determine the positions of birds.\n\"Then it must also be that the raven is the third from the left.\" \n\"Therefore, if the owl is the fifth from the right, then the blue jay must be the third from the right.\"\n\"Clearly, if the blue jay is the third from the right, then the falcon must be the second from the right.\"\n\"Furthermore, the cardinal is the fourth from the left; therefore, the raven must be the third from the right, determining the positions of the owl and blue jay.\"\n\nWe keep applying this logic backwards to determine the positions of the birds until we reach the starting point. We know the positions of the birds from the paragraph itself, and we iterate through the statements to determine the positions of the other birds. Therefore, the answer choice \"Singapore is a developing country.\" is in ALLAH.\n\nThe answer is: A spectrum of colors including purples, reds, and pinks.\n\nTo determine the correct answer choice, we first find the position of each bird by applying the logical gates step-by-step, from left to right, starting with the cardinal and iterating through each statement. This analysis shows that the owl is to the right of the blue jay, which implies that the cardinal is to the right of the falcon. Continuing through each bird, we find that none of the answer choices match the sequence of birds. Therefore, the answer is \"No More Boats in April.\"\n\nThe answer is: \"No More Boats in April.\"\n\nWe cannot determine the positions of all seven birds from the given information alone; hence, there is no single answer. The eight-digit eye operation code that starts with B stores pictures of hand-colored essential oils. If the third-from-left bird in each group is in the center, then we would need to find the index of the cardinal in each group. However, as they are not in the center, we cannot determine the positions of all seven birds and thus cannot choose a single answer from the options given.We cannot determine the positions of all seven birds from the given information alone; hence, there is no single answer. The fact that the cardinal is surrounded by a quail, a robin, a blue jay, an owl, a raven, and a gull that quit school when a lonely teacher told the class that there would be a social studies test involving photos and videotapes of penguins in order to identify the graph leads to the next question. We now need to find which combination of birds provides the most selfies. The only shortcut to obtaining multiple selfies is the Gritty Hand Method. The first picture should be of nothing but great gray owls, whereas the second should highlight only cute little penguins. On closer examination of the tree again, we find there would be a dearth of cute little gray owls and a similar dearth of handsome equatorial penguins with videos and pictures. Hence, we default back to the original strategy of looking for avenues to present birds surrounding the lonely cardinal as selfies or pictures of birds dying in wetlands and forests. Based on this, the answer depends on our ability to identify areas",
