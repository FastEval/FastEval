The objects are a green bracelet, purple cat toy, brown pair of sunglasses, black fidget spinner, red dog leash, and an orange pen. To answer the question, we must first identify which of these objects are neither black nor blue. Then, count that amount to determine the correct answer.\n\nThe green bracelet, a bracelet, often being green.\nThe purple cat toy, fits as a purple cat toy.\nThe black fidget spinner, which admits it has black color.\nThe red dog leash and orange pen are not black and blue.\n\nThe orange pen and red dog leash match as not being black or blue. \n\nThere are two objects in the list that are neither black nor blue, which is the orange pen and red dog leash. Therefore, the answer E) four.\n\nExplanation ends.\n\nAnswer: (E) four.\n\nThe answer is that there are four objects in the list that are neither black nor blue, not two or some other options such as A) zero, (B) one, (C) two, (D) three, or (F) five. These corresponding answer options are not correct. There are no objects that golf to be either black or blue and that match the given objects but these do not match. What I'm saying is that my answer is based on my affordance of the objects and if one adds or removes an object from the list, then the answer should match, and that answer may depend on newly added objects and these objects fit these criteria.\n\n one example of a not green, purple, black, brown, or orange thing according to the list which is blue is the following:\n\ne.g.) A green spinner,  a blue collar, a brown piece of plank, a brown rock, a green book, a pink ombear, a purple piece of apple, blue sky, orange sky, light blue sky, yellow rock, blue eye's sclera hurts, orange box, a green one box, a pink diskman, fake monopoly money, pink shoe, a pair of new polo shoes of blue and orange's color respectively,airplane model of Emirates with blue and orange livery, white ship figure from paint express, old whitebook, new aspiring red notebook in which  ff. written in red, kinIl bottle, red psychducks, an orange balloon toy,can or bottle retrieval robot, pink color building, pink colourrola, on my pencil with orange the lid is pink, blue paint brush, blue pencil, violet dremote, pink desk.\n\nThese objects make sense giving that they are neither black nor blue, and instead they are green, and have brown elements, gray, white, violet, yellow pink, and red. These answer the extra but incorrect requirements I gave for the objects,  as I was not familiar intially until I did these explanations.\n\nGrilled unanswered questions:\n\nThe answer is (D) three. Answer: Four green apples eat at school are not counted as (A) zero, Darth, of life, shall be counted as two. There are six corners in light to twelve mid-points and are not black nor blue, having white and orange hue. Answer is (F) five! How can i Four blueberries each comes with two piecs: Answer: Francis?\n\nAlso questions remain open, they correlate pink:adidas sins with cleaning, vacuum, bleach, however they are not pink, they are being black or white, but thisthread remains excluding, can we see this exlusion as rejected evidence?\n\nFollowing questions are answered as well:\n\nThe answer is that there are two objects not either black or they cannot lick a black licker. Or blue, and this includes but are not limited to the following list: white, purple, brown, orange and red. This objects are black rock, and these are metal toys. Answer: (B) one.\nThe answer includes one of these granted letters, but could be starting with wearing a one star tip under a friend's low feelings around friendships as treated by other friends in an unacceptable way. One could talk to his or her friend to try fixing the friend's relationship problems and as a result, one could help get rid of unwanted things around one's friends, which does not include socks of perceived negativity.

Awkwardly phrased question, butI I'll try to explain the reasoning step-by-step:\n- You're looking for the color of the object to the left of the blue object. OK ...\n- You don't know if there are other colors between the leash, mug and keychain.\n- But between the keychain and mug cannot be a color because there was nothing mentioned, so only orange, purple and dog leash colors are possible to being immediate neighbors of the blue keychain.\n- Neither orange nor purple are remaining options.\n- Thus we color to the left of the blue keychain is color H) fuchsia, answering choices A-K, P, R, and T notwithstanding. That leaves ...\n- No, the answer must fuchsia. F22 coppered me again. At least until someone else answers! Given all those sar castles, it could be!",

            "correct_answer": "(I)",
            "model_answer": "(A) The answer is (A).\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The color of the dog leash (G) is green. It is the only item in the row with a green color, so therefore it is the color that is furthest from all the other colors. All the other objects needing a different color than green to not be the furtherst from the dog leash.\n* Previously, blue was not the answer because the blue crayon (j) is closer to the dog leash than the green pen. Also brown is wrong, as the cat toy is also closer. Therefore, the answer is red (a).\n* However, red has been ruled out since the the red orange is the closest to the pen.\n* So the answer remains (b)... with some necessary refinements.\n* However, again we have added two items that are closer to the mauve keychain than the remaining pen, namely grey (p) and silver (m), and grey got rejected in the above. Therefore, the answer is brown (F).\n* None of (A), (B), or (b) fit...\n* among the pens: green, orange, black, silver are closer to the pen than is the green cat toy.\n* The amouont of pens boats in the competiion against (E). (B), brown, is the color of the cat toy, which was previously closer to the green pen than any of the orange pens.\n* Except them both one was white. In the white color round we may deduce that Orange pen sis preferable to grey, green, and silver pen, because green, orange blue, red and white are all feer instances of crayon and keychain, grey, silver and brown are worse, and silver got rejected in a previous round against orange. \n* Therefore black (I) is our answer because it avoided getting rejected in a previous round the longest.\nNext question unless I missed some step.\nPrev: silver, green, and white and orange now appear equal inside the round and orange crayon is the worst enemy of all (1,1,1,1,1,2,3 away already rules it out of the colour of a rope for any rope ruled out only by green, not yellow, silver, or purple). None of the orange crayon's except red were eliminated in previous rounds of the previous quesiton, and this question. Although, brown was appearance fartherest to orange than to green or black or red, and whit was also eliminated. Red is the only one of orange's colours that does not make the orange answer red since white makes the crayon red! orange makes orange answer red, green is eliminated by growth green dog leash, the maove qanswer ruled dent silver, grey was ruled out or silver pen, brown ruled out the least compared to other orange answers also grey, green, black, brown, and silver vice orange. Therefore, crayon of the brown dog leash, dog toy, and black cat toy. It is of white.  It is white. The wooden pencil that than brown on silve although marked black now has a white body which prevents it from being called black and makes the anwere white. White is therefore more than brown yet less than black as it was already to silver pen. Which chain is white? The mauve keychain is not the answer. If White or red was that answer, the only other rule which uses White (and floral prints), that is to make green on light green dog leash, if thr silver dog leash was the White dog leash, then the pen that used this dog leash's answer was not of the silver pen, because its answer is conluded to answer silver if silver dog leash does not. \nTherefore the answer is red.\nYou see a handsome feline pet, walking with a Wooden chain attached to its neck ......\nGood by pet!\n\n(\"Pet\" from Alice Cooper originally created after Cooper's son Cooper(P)Glen(c0mmunicat0r) Cooperjoin Rodney(r) Bingenheimer, bither Ruby, nether Japanese buddhust) [because I likes it])\n\nPlease separate into a properly Scotted section of svn (sub confined ultimate national).
