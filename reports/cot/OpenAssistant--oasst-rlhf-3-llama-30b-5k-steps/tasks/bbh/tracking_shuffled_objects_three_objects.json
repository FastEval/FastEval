However, the key moment is the trade with Claire, because if Bob had Frankenstein before, he wouldn't have traded for it again. But, Lolita is a more interesting novel, so Bob specifically wanted to get it in the second trade. The same logic applies to the first exchange too, so the order is: Claire has Frankenstein -> Claire and Bob exchange books, resulting in Bob having Frankenstein and Claire having Lolita -> Bob and Alice exchange books, resulting in Alice having Lolita -> Claire and Bob exchange books again, leaving Bob with Frankenstein and Claire having Lolita, while Alice has Lolita.

At this point I could stop and state that C is the answer; however, there is more information to consider.\n4. Bob switched from dancing with Lola to dancing with Ophelia.

Alice and Bob entered the final round of switches still dancing with their initial partners, Alice with Helga, (B)ob dancing with the C-dancer (Ophelia), and Alice remained Helga while Bob switched dance positions with Lola's partner (by now know to include Claire), making Alice's final dance partner Lola.\n6. At the end of the dance, Alice danced with the C-dancer (Lola), who was also dancing with Claire at dance positions C and L respectively.\n7. For the question \"At the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with\", option (B), Bob's (final dance partner), is incorrect, while (A) is also false because Helga did not dance with Alice at the end, leaving (C) as the final answer to the final question: Who Alice danced with at the final round of switches.\n\nAbbreviated, Alice danced with her (B)ob dancing partner from C-dancer (Lola) during the song (thanks to several rounds of switches).\n\nC-dancer entered the final round of switches while dancing with (B)ob.
