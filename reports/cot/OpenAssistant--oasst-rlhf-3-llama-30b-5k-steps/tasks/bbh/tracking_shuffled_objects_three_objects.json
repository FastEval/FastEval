Since Alice does not\nhave Claire's original book, this means that Claire\ndid not trade with Alice the first time. Thus,\nClaire must have traded with Bob. That is, Claire\ntraded her book for Bob's book. But since Bob once\nhad Frankenstein and now has Moby Dick, this means that Claire must have had Frankenstein to begin with. And this means that the answer is:\n(A).\n\nANSWER:\n(A) Alice has Frankenstein\n(B) Bob has\n(C) Claire has\n(B) is not possible because Alice and Bob traded Frankenstein and Moby Dick, respectively.\n(C) is not possible because we know that Claire had The Fellowship of the Ring to begin with and must have traded it at least once, meaning that the book remaining is not hers.",
