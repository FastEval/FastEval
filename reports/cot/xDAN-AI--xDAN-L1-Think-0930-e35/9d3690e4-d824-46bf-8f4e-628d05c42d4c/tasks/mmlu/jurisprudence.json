The reasonable person standard is meant to be a universally applicable standard of behavior.\n\n(B) The reasonable person standard focuses on the defendant's subjective mental state rather than on the defendant's behavior\n- This statement is incorrect because the reasonable person standard focuses on the defendant's behavior and not their subjective mental state. The standard is about what a reasonable person would do in the same situation, not about the defendant's thoughts or feelings.\n\n(C) A person with a physical disability must act as would a reasonable person with the same disability.\n- This statement is a condition that must be met by a person with a physical disability, but it does not directly address the question of whether the reasonable person standard varies from person to person.\n\n(D) A person with a mental disability must act as would a person with the same mental disability.\n- This statement is a condition that must be met by a person with a mental disability, but it does not directly address the question of whether the reasonable person standard varies from person to person.\n\nBased on the analysis, none of the statements directly address the question of whether the reasonable person standard varies from person to person.

Rather, he believes that reason is necessary for living a good and virtuous life.\n\n(B) The principles of natural law are discoverable by reason.\nCicero does agree that the principles of natural law can be discovered through reason, but he does not believe that reason is the sole or final authority in determining what the principles of natural law are. He believes that reason must be in agreement with nature.\n\n(C) Natural law does not apply without good reason.\nThis is a somewhat confusing option, as it seems to contradict the idea that natural law is based on reason. If natural law does not apply without good reason, then it is not based on reason. However, Cicero does believe that natural law must be in agreement with reason, so this option is not entirely accurate.\n\n(D) The law of nature is the basis of all positive law.\nCicero does believe that the law of nature is the foundation of all positive law, but he does not claim that it is the sole authority or that it determines what positive law should be. Instead, he believes that reason must be in agreement with nature in order to determine what the positive law should be.\n\nBased on the analysis of each option, the answer is:\n\n(D) The law of nature is the basis of all positive law.",

Critical legal theorists are people who critique and question the norms, values, and principles of legal systems. They often emphasize the importance of context, politics, and the role of the judge in shaping the law. \n\nNow, let's evaluate each proposition:\n\n(A) Law is politics.\nThis statement aligns with the views of critical legal theorists, as they emphasize the importance of politics in shaping the law.\n\n(B) Law is determinate.\nThis statement contradicts the views of critical legal theorists, as they usually argue that the law is context-dependent and subjective.\n\n(C) Law reflects economic power.\nThis statement can be seen as aligning with the views of critical legal theorists, as they might argue that the law is influenced by economic power.\n\n(D) Law is unstable.\nThis statement can also be seen as aligning with the views of critical legal theorists, as they might argue that the law is dynamic and constantly changing.\n\nBased on the evaluation, we can see that propositions (A), (C), and (D) are all potentially acceptable to critical legal theorists. However, since we need to choose only one proposition, we must consider which one is most likely to be rejected by those who describe themselves as critical legal theorists.\n\nProposition (B) is the most likely to be rejected by critical legal theorists, as it contradicts their emphasis on the subjective and context-dependent nature of the law.\n\n### Answer:\n\nB",
