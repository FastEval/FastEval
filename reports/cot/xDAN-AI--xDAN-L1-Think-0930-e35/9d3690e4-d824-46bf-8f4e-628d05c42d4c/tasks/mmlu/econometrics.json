The fitted regression line is the line that best fits the data points, meaning that it has the smallest sum of squared errors between the observed data points and the line.\n\nNow let's examine each statement:\n\n(A) This statement includes the intercept, the slope, and the residual error term. This is indeed a correct algebraic representation of the fitted regression line.\n\n(B) This statement only includes the slope and the intercept. This is a correct representation of the regression line, but it doesn't include the residual error term.\n\n(C) This statement includes the intercept, the slope, and the residual error term, just like statement (A).\n\n(D) This statement only includes the slope and the intercept, just like statement (B).\n\nSo, as you can see, statements (A) and (C) are both correct representations of the fitted regression line, including the intercept, the slope, and the residual error term. The difference between them is that statement (A) includes the residual error term in the same line as the intercept and the slope, while statement (C) separates the residual error term from the intercept and the slope. Statement (B) is missing the intercept, and statement (D) is missing the residual error term.\n\nTherefore, there are two correct answers: (A) and (C).",

It is used to evaluate the performance of a model by measuring the average squared difference between the model's predictions and the actual values. In the context of trading rules, MSE could be used to assess the profitability of a rule.

It is used to find the average squared difference between the forecast and the actual value. It does not necessarily penalize large forecast errors more than small forecast errors.

A standard GARCH(1,1) model can capture this feature by estimating the volatility of the returns.\n\nii) Leverage effects: These are the consequences of using borrowed funds to invest in assets, which can magnify the impact of market changes on returns.
