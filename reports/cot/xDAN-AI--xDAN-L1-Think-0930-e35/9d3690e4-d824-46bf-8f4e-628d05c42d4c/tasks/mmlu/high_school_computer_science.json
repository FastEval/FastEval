The reasoning behind this is that higher-level languages are more easily understood by humans, but they are ultimately translated into binary code by the computer. So, this option is true.\n\n(B) This option states that the program can be expressed in binary code, which can reduce the likelihood of errors. The reasoning behind this is that binary code is less prone to errors than higher-level languages because it is less likely to be misinterpreted by humans. However, this is not always true, as higher-level languages can still have fewer errors due to their more explicit nature. So, this option is not necessarily true.\n\n(C) This option states that the program cannot be expressed in binary code. The reasoning behind this is that binary code can only be used to represent data, not programs. However, this is not true, as programs can indeed be expressed in binary code, especially in the form of machine code. So, this option is false.\n\n(D) This option states that some parts of the program can be expressed in binary code, while operations must be expressed using a higher-level programming language. The reasoning behind this is that binary code can be used to represent certain operations more efficiently, but higher-level languages are better suited for expressing the overall structure and logic of the program.
