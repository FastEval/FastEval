            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's examine each theory and see which one uses terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour.\n\n(A) Sociobiology: Sociobiology is a theory that focuses on the evolution and social behavior of organisms. It does not primarily use terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour.\n\n(B) Psychoanalytic theory: Psychoanalytic theory is based on the ideas of Sigmund Freud. It does use terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour. In this theory, exposure to erotica can lead to an unconscious imitation of the behaviours and desires seen in the material, which can then influence a person's real-life behaviour.\n\n(C) Script theory: Script theory is a theory that suggests people have an internal script or blueprint for their interactions with others. While it does use terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\", it does not primarily focus on the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour.\n\n(D) Social learning theory: Social learning theory is a theory that suggests people learn from observing and imitating others. It does use terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\", but it does not primarily focus on the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour.\n\nBased on the examination of each theory, the answer is (B) psychoanalytic theory, as it uses terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, let's understand the terms and the process of sperm passage. Sperm passage refers to the movement of sperm from the male to the female reproductive tract. This typically occurs during the process of fertilization.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Preovulation: This term refers to the time before the release of mature eggs (ovulation). This is not the most hospitable environment for sperm passage, as sperm need to reach the female reproductive tract after the mature eggs have been released.\n\n(B) Proliferation: This term generally refers to the growth or increase in number of cells. It is not a relevant term in the context of sperm passage.\n\n(C) Ovulation: This is the release of mature eggs (ovulation) from the female ovarian follicle. This is a key event in the process of sperm passage, as it marks the time when sperm has a better chance of meeting the egg.\n\n(D) Menstruation: This term refers to the monthly shedding of the uterine lining. This is not the most hospitable environment for sperm passage, as sperm need to travel through the female reproductive tract after the shedding of the uterine lining.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most hospitable environment for sperm passage is just at (C) ovulation.",

We are asked to determine which of the following hormones is inhibited by female sterilization.\n\n1. Egg (A): Egg production is not inhibited by female sterilization, as the procedure does not affect the production of eggs in the ovaries. In fact, female sterilization is often performed on women who want to avoid pregnancy, and it does not affect the production of eggs.\n\n2. Estrogen (B): Estrogen production is not directly inhibited by female sterilization. The procedure does not affect the function of the ovaries or the production of estrogen. However, it is important to consider that female sterilization can have other hormonal effects, such as reducing the levels of progesterone.\n\n3. Progesterone (C): Progesterone production is not directly inhibited by female sterilization either. The procedure does not affect the production of progesterone in the ovaries. However, it is important to consider that female sterilization can have other hormonal effects, such as reducing the levels of estrogen.\n\n4. None of the above (D): Since neither egg production nor estrogen or progesterone production is directly inhibited by female sterilization, the correct answer is \"None of the above.\"\n\n### Answer:\nD",

We know that the embryo is about 1 centimetre long after 4 days (since 28 days - 4 days = 24 days).\n2. In the next 24 days, the embryo will grow at a rate of about 1 centimetre per day (since it grew by 1 centimetre in the first 4 days).\n3. So, the embryo will grow by 24 centimetres in the next 24 days (1 centimetre per day * 24 days).\n4. Therefore, the embryo is about 1 centimetre longer than the length after 4 days (1 centimetre * 24 days = 24 centimetres).\n\nSo, the answer is (D) 4.",

Research on attraction and compatibility can have different findings depending on the sample population. For example, some studies might find that opposites attract for heterosexuals, while others might find that it's homosexuals or a specific gender that's more likely to be attracted to opposites.\n\nWithout specific research, it's hard to definitively say which of the options is true. However, since the question is about the folk saying \"opposites attract\" and not about a specific research finding, the answer should be based on the general idea that opposites attract.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n(B) It seems to be true for heterosexuals but not for homosexuals.",
