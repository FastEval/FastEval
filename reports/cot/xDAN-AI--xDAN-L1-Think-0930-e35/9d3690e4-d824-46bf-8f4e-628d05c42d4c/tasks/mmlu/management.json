            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, let's examine each option and determine which one is not a key management skill in planning:\n\n(A) Conceptual skills: These are important for understanding and creating new ideas or theories. They are relevant to planning as it involves making decisions and seeing the bigger picture. So, this could be a key management skill in planning.\n\n(B) Analytical skills: These are important for breaking down complex situations and problems into smaller, more manageable parts. They are also useful in planning, as they help in making data-driven decisions. So, this could also be a key management skill in planning.\n\n(C) IT and computing skills: While these skills are necessary for many modern jobs, they are not specifically a management skill in planning. Managers need to understand technology, but their focus is more on people and concepts, not on computers and programming. So, this one seems less relevant to planning.\n\n(D) Communication skills: These are crucial for managers, as they need to communicate effectively with their team members and other stakeholders. Communication is a key aspect of planning, as managers need to explain their vision and inspire others to work towards a common goal. So, this could also be a key management skill in planning.\n\nBased on the analysis, the option that is not a key management skill in planning is:\n\n(C) IT and computing skills",

            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Team culture: In a team culture, workers are organized into smaller groups to accomplish specific tasks. Team members may have a high level of trust and collaboration, but the focus is on individual goals rather than collective progress.\n\n(B) Collaborative culture: In a collaborative culture, workers are encouraged to communicate openly and share ideas. This leads to a high level of trust and teamwork, with a focus on collective progress and shared goals.\n\n(C) Group culture: In a group culture, workers are divided into larger groups based on shared characteristics or interests. Group members may have a sense of belonging, but the focus is often more on personal goals than collective progress.\n\n(D) Collective culture: In a collective culture, workers are highly interdependent and have a strong sense of shared goals and collective progress. Individual needs are subordinate to the needs of the group, and there is a high level of trust and teamwork.\n\nBased on the definitions provided, the best answer is:\n\n(D) Collective culture",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, let's examine each characteristic to see which one does not fit with the general concept of a corporate social responsibility framework.\n\n(A) Retaining the status quo: This means maintaining the current situation without any changes. In the context of corporate social responsibility, this would mean not taking any actions to improve the community, the environment, or the company's reputation. This does not align with the idea of a corporate social responsibility framework, which is to actively work towards positive change.\n\n(B) Understanding society: This characteristic is more about the company's understanding of the society it operates within. It's not a direct part of a corporate social responsibility framework, but it can contribute to the framework by helping the company make better decisions that align with social and environmental concerns.\n\n(C) Harnessing diversity: This refers to actively seeking out and utilizing the different aspects of diversity, such as different ethnicities, genders, or cultures. This is not a characteristic of a corporate social responsibility framework, as it is more about diversity and inclusion, which are important aspects of a company's culture.\n\n(D) Building capacity: This means developing the skills and resources needed to address social and environmental issues effectively. This is a direct part of a corporate social responsibility framework, as companies are expected to build capacity to carry out their commitments.\n\nBased on the analysis, the characteristic that is not a part of a corporate social responsibility framework is (C) Harnessing diversity.",
