            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt a meeting of working girls held at Hull House during a strike in a large shoe factory, the discussions made it clear that the strikers who had been most easily frightened, and therefore the first to capitulate, were naturally those girls who were paying board and were afraid of being put out if they fell too far behind. After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nThe perspective of the passage above would most directly support which of the following political goals?\n\n(A) Women's suffrage\n(B) Trust-busting\n(C) Greater rights for unions\n(D) Weakening political machines",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A). The passage provided by the OP speaks of the far-reaching and boundless future of the United States, destined to be an era of American greatness. It mentions the nation's destiny to manifest the excellence of divine principles and establish the noblest temple dedicated to the worship of the Most High on earth. It also mentions the floor of this temple being a hemisphere and the roof being the firmament of the star-studded heavens. This is a metaphorical description of the nation's future, and it is not directly related to the effect of the American rail system in the nineteenth century.\n\nHowever, the answer (A) \"Government subsidy of the railroads enabled markets to expand and for production to become more efficient\" is the most plausible in the context of the passage provided. The passage speaks of the nation's greatness and destiny, but it does not directly address the effect of the rail system. But if we consider the metaphorical description of the nation's future and the context of the passage, it can be inferred that the development of the rail system helped in expanding markets and enabling production to become more efficient, which is why (A) is the best answer among the given options.",

But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nThe policy described most immediately led to\n\n(A) peace between Indian tribes and white settlers.\n(B) the forced removal of the Cherokee from their homeland.\n(C) the first Treaty of Fort Laramie, which guaranteed Indian possession of lands west of the Mississippi River.\n(D) a negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government, by which the tribes were allowed to remain on their lands for ten years.",
