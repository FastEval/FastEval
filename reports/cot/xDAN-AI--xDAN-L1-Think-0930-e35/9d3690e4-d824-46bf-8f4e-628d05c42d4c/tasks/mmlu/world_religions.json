            "model_answer": "First, let's understand what Gathas means in the Zoroastrian tradition.\n\nGathas are sacred texts in Zoroastrianism, and they are considered the foundation of the religion. They are attributed to Zoroaster, who is believed to be the founder of the religion.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options given:\n\n(A) Hymns: Gathas can be seen as hymns, as they are sacred texts that are recited or sung by the followers of the religion.\n(B) Laws: Gathas also contain laws and regulations, as they provide guidance on how followers should live their lives.\n(C) Ethics: Gathas can be seen as a form of ethics, as they teach followers about morality and how to live a good life.\n(D) Myths: Gathas do contain some myths, but they are mainly focused on religious teachings and not on stories or narratives.\n\nBased on the analysis, Gathas in the Zoroastrian tradition can be seen as:\n\n(A) Hymns\n(B) Laws\n(C) Ethics\n\nSo the answer is (A) Hymns.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, let's break down the term \"janam-sakhis\". The word \"janam\" in Punjabi translates to \"birth\" and \"sakhis\" means \"stories\". So, \"janam-sakhis\" can be translated as \"birth stories\" or \"nativity stories\".\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Spiritual narratives: Although some janam-sakhis might have spiritual themes, this genre encompasses a broader range of stories. So, this is not the correct answer.\n\n(B) Redemption narratives: Janam-sakhis primarily focus on the birth of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism, and his spiritual journey. Redemption narratives might be a part of Sikh literature, but they are not the primary focus of janam-sakhis.\n\n(C) Birth narratives: This seems to be the most accurate genre for janam-sakhis, as they primarily focus on the birth and early life of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.\n\n(D) Theological narratives: Although some janam-sakhis might touch upon theological themes, they are not the primary focus of these stories.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (C) Birth narratives.",

            "model_answer": "First, let's break down the question and understand what we need to answer. We are asked to describe how the Egyptian composition \"Ludul Bel Nemequi\" (Praise to the Lord of Wisdom) portrays Marduk. This composition is about Marduk, an important figure in the Egyptian pantheon.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) Loving and forgiving\n(B) Wrathful and merciful\n(C) Judging and vengeful\n(D) Transcendent and immanent\n\nWe need to find which option best describes how Marduk is portrayed in the composition. To do this, we can look at the meaning of the title \"Ludul Bel Nemequi.\" The name \"Ludul Bel Nemequi\" translates to \"Praise to the Lord of Wisdom.\" From this, we can infer that the composition is praising Marduk for his wisdom.\n\nWith this information, we can now evaluate the options:\n\n(A) Loving and forgiving\n(B) Wrathful and merciful\n(C) Judging and vengeful\n(D) Transcendent and immanent\n\n(A) and (B) seem to describe two opposing traits. If the composition is praising Marduk for his wisdom, it is likely not portraying him as loving and forgiving, at least not exclusively. Similarly, option (C) seems to contradict the idea of praising someone for their wisdom.\n\n(D) seems like a good fit, as it can describe both the transcendent (omniscient) nature of Marduk and his immanent (present) role in the world.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n(D) Transcendent and immanent",

It is believed to have been written down in the 19th century BCE.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) Through initiation into the mystery cults - This option seems unlikely, as kingship in ancient Sumer was not associated with mystery cults.\n\n(B) By military victories - While military success might have played a role in the rise of some kings, it was not the sole basis for kingship in Sumer.\n\n(C) Direct lineage of ancestors - This option seems most plausible, as kingship in ancient Sumer was often linked to family lineage and inheritance.\n\n(D) Descends from heaven - This option is less likely, as it is not consistent with the historical context of Sumer.\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer is (C) Direct lineage of ancestors.",
