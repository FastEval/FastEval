So the area of the rectangle is $3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n\n2. Calculate the area of the region where $x < y$:\nThe rectangle has two pairs of vertical sides with slopes $1$ and $-1$.

Since the population increases proportionally to the number present, we can represent this growth as an exponential function.\n\n1. We know that the initial population is 200.\n2. After 10 hours, the population triples once. So, we multiply the initial population by 3: 200 * 3 = 600.\n3. After another 10 hours (24 hours total), the population triples again. We multiply the current population (600) by 3: 600 * 3 = 1800.\n4. We can continue this process for as many 10-hour intervals as needed, multiplying the current population by 3 each time.\n\nHowever, we are asked for the approximate number of bacteria after 1 full day (24 hours). We don't need to calculate the bacteria population for each of the 24 hours, nor do we need to wait 24 hours for the population to triple again.\n\nInstead, we can use the fact that the population triples every 10 hours to our advantage. We know that the population after 10 hours is 1800.

He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.\n3.

So, we can set up the following equation:\n\nOriginal number of pins - (1/6) pins = 66 pins\n\nStep 3: Solve for the original number of pins:\n\nOriginal number of pins = (1/6) pins + 66 pins\n\nOriginal number of pins = 11 pins (since 66 + 11 = 77, which is the closest whole number to 792, the only multiple of 66)\n\nStep 4: Since there are two piles with an equal number of pins, we can divide the original number of pins by 2 to find the number of pins in one pile:\n\nNumber of pins in one pile = 11 pins / 2 = 5.5 pins\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a fraction of a pin, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number.
