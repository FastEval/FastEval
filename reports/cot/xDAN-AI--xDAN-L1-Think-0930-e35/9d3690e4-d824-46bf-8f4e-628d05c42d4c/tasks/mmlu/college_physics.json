            "model_answer": "To find the total mechanical energy, we need to find the potential energy and the kinetic energy of the system.\n\n1. Potential energy: The potential energy of the spring is given by the formula:\nPE = k * x\nwhere k is the spring constant and x is the displacement.\n\n2. Kinetic energy: The kinetic energy of the mass is given by the formula:\nKE = 0.5 * m * v^2\nwhere m is the mass and v is the velocity.\n\n3.

Therefore, the energy radiated per second per unit area is proportional to the absolute temperature of the blackbody.\n\nLet's denote the energy radiated per second per unit area at the initial temperature as E0. Then, the energy radiated per second per unit area at the new temperature (3 times the initial temperature) will be:\n\nE = E0 * (f(\u03bb) / f(\u03bb) * (T / T\u2080))\n\nwhere T is the new absolute temperature and T\u2080 is the initial absolute temperature.\n\nSince f(\u03bb) is constant, the expression (f(\u03bb) / f(\u03bb) * (T / T\u2080)) simplifies to 1. Therefore, the energy radiated per second per unit area at the new temperature is:\n\nE = E0 * (T / T\u2080)\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the new energy to the initial energy:\n\nRatio = (E_new / E_initial) = (E / E0)\n\nWe are given that the absolute temperature of the blackbody is increased by a factor of 3. Therefore, the new absolute temperature (T) is 3 times the initial absolute temperature (T\u2080):\n\nT = 3 * T\u2080\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the ratio:\n\nRatio = (E / E0) = ((T / T\u2080) * E0) / E0\n\nSince E0 is constant, the expression (T / T\u2080) * E0 simplifies to 1.
