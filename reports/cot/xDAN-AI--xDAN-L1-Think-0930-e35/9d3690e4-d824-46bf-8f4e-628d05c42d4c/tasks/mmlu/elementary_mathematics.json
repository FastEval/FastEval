            "model_answer": "First, we need to determine how many members are in the Hiking Club. We know that each member hikes for 2.4 hours and covers 2.5 miles per hour. \n\n1. Find the total distance covered by one member:\n   Distance per member = Distance per hour * Hours per member\n   = 2.5 miles/hour * 2.4 hours\n   = 6 miles\n\n2. Next, we need to find the total distance covered by the entire club. We can do this by multiplying the distance covered by one member (6 miles) by the number of members.\n   Total distance = Distance per member * Number of members\n   = 6 miles * x (where x is the number of members)\n\n3. Now we need to find the number of members. Since we know that each member hikes for 2.4 hours, we can assume that there are at least 2 members who have hiked for the same amount of time (2.4 hours). We can use this information to find the number of members.\n   Let's assume there are y members who have hiked for 2.4 hours. Then the remaining (x-y) members must have hiked for the same amount of time (2.4 hours) as the first y members.\n   We know that the total distance covered by the club is 6 miles * x, and that the distance covered by the first y members is 6 miles * y. Since the distances are equal, we can write the equation:\n   y * 6 miles = x * 6 miles\n   = 6 miles\n\n4. We now know that there are at least 2 members who have hiked for 2.4 hours, so we can find the number of members by dividing the total distance (6 miles) by the distance covered by one member (6 miles):\n   x = 6 miles / 6 miles\n   = 1\n\n5. Finally, we can find the total distance covered by the club by multiplying the distance per member (6 miles) by the number of members (1):\n   Total distance = 6 miles * 1\n   = 6 miles\n\nSo the answer is (C) 6.0 miles.",
