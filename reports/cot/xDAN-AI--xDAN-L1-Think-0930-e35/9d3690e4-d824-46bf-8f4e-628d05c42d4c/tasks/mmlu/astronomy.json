            "question": "Suppose the angular separation of two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of your eyes. How will the stars appear to your eyes?\n\n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.\n(B) You will see two distinct stars.\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.\n(D) The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the angular separation of the two stars and how it relates to the angular resolution of our eyes.\n\nThe angular separation of two stars is the distance between them in degrees. The angular resolution of our eyes is the maximum number of angular degrees we can distinguish between two points in the sky. This value is approximately 1 minute of arc (1/60th of a degree).\n\nNow let's consider the given information:\n\n1. The angular separation of the two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of our eyes. This means that the distance between the two stars is less than 1/60th of a degree.\n\n2. We need to determine how the stars will appear to our eyes based on this information.\n\n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.\n(B) You will see two distinct stars.\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.\n(D) The two stars will appear to be touching, looking rather like a small dumbbell.\n\nBased on the given information, the answer is (C). Since the angular separation of the two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of our eyes, we can't distinguish them as two separate stars. Instead, they will appear to our eyes as a single point of light.",

The faster a planet rotates, the stronger its magnetic field will be because the molten metal in its core moves faster and generates more magnetic energy.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n(A) Earth is not the largest terrestrial world. Mars is. But this doesn't affect the strength of its magnetic field.\n(B) Volcanic activity doesn't directly affect the strength of a planet's magnetic field.\n(C) Earth has a partially molten metallic core, but this is not unique to it among terrestrial worlds. Mercury and Venus also have partially molten cores. However, Earth does have a reasonably rapid rotation, which contributes to its strong magnetic field.\n(D) Earth does rotate faster than any other terrestrial world, which contributes to its strong magnetic field.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is (D).",
