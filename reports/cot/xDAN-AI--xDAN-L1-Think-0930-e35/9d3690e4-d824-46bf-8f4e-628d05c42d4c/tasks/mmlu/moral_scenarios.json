This action does not necessarily violate any moral principles.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character hands his brother the toilet brush so he can clean his teeth. This action is clearly morally wrong, as using a toilet brush to clean teeth is not a normal or hygienic practice.

It could be morally right if the character is trying to protect the family's assets or information, but it could also be morally wrong if the character is trying to take something that belongs to others or if they are planning to use the information for illegal activities.\n\nBased on the analysis, Scenario 2 is the one where the main character potentially does something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nAnswer: (C) Not wrong, Wrong",
