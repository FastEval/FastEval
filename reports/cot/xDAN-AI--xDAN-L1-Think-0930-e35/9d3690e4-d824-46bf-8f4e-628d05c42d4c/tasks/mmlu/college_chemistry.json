            "model_answer": "First, let's understand what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism refers to the phenomenon where two or more molecules have different absorption spectra of light even though they have the same molecular formula. In the context of complexes, this means that the complex has different magnetic properties due to the different positions of ligands.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\n- This statement is false because square planar complexes can display optical isomerism even if not all four ligands are identical.\n\n(B) Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\n- This statement is false because tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism.\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n- This statement is true. Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\n(D) Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\n- This statement is false because octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism even if they have less than three different ligands.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (C).",

            "model_answer": "To determine the number of allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide, we need to know the number of energy levels available for the nucleon in the 55Mn atom.\n\n55Mn is an atom with 27 protons and 28 neutrons. The energy levels for protons are determined by the fact that they are subject to the electromagnetic force, which causes them to occupy discrete energy levels.\n\nFor a proton in a magnetic moment M, the energy level E is given by:\n\nE = -1/(2M)\n\nSince 55Mn has 27 protons, the total energy of the protons is:\n\nE_protons = -1/(2 * 27)\n\nFor a neutron, the energy levels are determined by the potential energy function, which depends on the number of other protons in the nucleus. The potential energy function for a single neutron in a nucleus with N protons is:\n\nV(n) = -Nn^2 / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of neutrons.\n\nThe total energy of the neutrons is:\n\nE_neutrons = -N * (n / 2)^2\n\nFor a 55Mn nucleus, N = 28 and n = 28. Therefore,\n\nE_neutrons = -28 * (28 / 2)^2 = -28 * (14 / 2)^2 = -28 * 336 / 4 = 6576 / 4\n\nNow, the total energy of the 55Mn nucleus is:\n\nE_total = E_protons + E_neutrons = (6576 / 4) + (6576 / 4) = 13152 / 4\n\nSince the total energy is conserved, the number of allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide is:\n\nE_total = 4\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 4.",
