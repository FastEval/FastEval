            "question": "Which of the following is LEAST self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry?\n\n(A) United States\n(B) Japan\n(C) France\n(D) United Kingdom",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what it means for a country to be self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry. This means that the country has enough of its own natural resources to meet its own needs for these resources without relying on imports from other countries.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) United States:\nThe United States is a very large country with a wide range of natural resources. It produces and exports oil, natural gas, coal, iron ore, and other important raw materials. So, it is quite self-sufficient in these resources.\n\n(B) Japan:\nJapan is a small country with limited natural resources. It relies heavily on imports for its energy and raw materials. It imports about 90% of its oil and 95% of its natural gas. So, it is not very self-sufficient in these resources.\n\n(C) France:\nFrance is a medium-sized country with a fair amount of natural resources. It produces and exports oil, natural gas, coal, iron ore, and other important raw materials to some extent. So, it is quite self-sufficient in these resources.\n\n(D) United Kingdom:\nThe United Kingdom is a small country with limited natural resources. It relies heavily on imports for its energy and raw materials. It imports about 80% of its oil and 95% of its natural gas. So, it is not very self-sufficient in these resources.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is (D) United Kingdom, as it is the least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry among the four countries listed.",

            "question": "When a new fashion design is introduced globally, the information initially travels through a process known as\n\n(A) contagious diffusion\n(B) relocation diffusion\n(C) innovative diffusion\n(D) hierarchical diffusion",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand the four processes mentioned and how they relate to the introduction of a new fashion design globally:\n\n(A) Contagious diffusion: This process occurs when an innovation spreads from one person or group to another, usually through contact or communication. In the context of fashion design, this could mean that designers influence each other, or that fashion trends spread across different regions.\n\n(B) Relocation diffusion: This process is about people moving from one place to another and bringing ideas with them. In the context of fashion design, this could mean that designers move to a new city or country and introduce their fashion styles to the local market.\n\n(C) Innovative diffusion: This process refers to the adoption of new ideas, products, or services by individuals or organizations. In the context of fashion design, this could mean that designers adopt new design techniques, fabrics, or styles to create fresh and innovative looks.\n\n(D) Hierarchical diffusion: This process is about information spreading from higher-level individuals or groups to lower-level ones. In the context of fashion design, this could mean that runway fashion influences street fashion or that designers learn from established fashion houses.\n\nNow, considering all these processes, we can determine which one is most likely to be responsible for the initial information traveling globally when a new fashion design is introduced. In this case, it seems that the process of contagious diffusion is the most relevant, as it directly involves the spread of ideas, trends, and influences between designers and their peers.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(A)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, let's briefly explain Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation.\n\nGunnar Myrdal, a prominent economist, proposed a theory of cumulative causation in his book \"Asian Drama: An Inquiry into the Poverty of Nations.\" The theory revolves around the idea that economic development in certain regions can lead to further development in other regions.\n\nNow, let's examine each statement and see which one is not part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation.\n\n(A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.\nThis statement aligns with Myrdal's theory, as he argues that wealth in developed regions can lead to wealth in developing regions through trade and other economic activities.\n\n(B) The core will always dominate the periphery.\nThis statement is not entirely consistent with Myrdal's theory. While he does believe that the core region has an advantage, he does not claim that the periphery will always be dominated.\n\n(C) Growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery.\nThis statement is also consistent with Myrdal's theory, as he believes that the growth of the core region can lead to development in the periphery.\n\n(D) Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade.\nThis statement is aligned with Myrdal's theory, as he believes that regions with initial advantages can continue to develop due to the attraction of resources like labor and capital.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the statement that is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation is:\n\n(B) The core will always dominate the periphery.",
