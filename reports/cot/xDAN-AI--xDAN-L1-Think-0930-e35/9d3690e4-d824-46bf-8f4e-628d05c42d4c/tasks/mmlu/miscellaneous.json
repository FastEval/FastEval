It just teaches students to count.\n\n(B) Having students put one apple in the middle of the place mat on their desks\nThis task is unrelated to comparing quantities. It's just about arranging apples on a place mat.\n\n(C) Having students make a Venn diagram for the color of the apples\nA Venn diagram is a great tool for comparing sets, but in this case, the students are only given red and yellow apples. So, they won't be able to compare any quantities; they'll just be categorizing the apples.\n\n(D) Having students determine whether the numbers of red and yellow apples are equal\nThis task involves comparing the quantities of red and yellow apples.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to determine the amount of energy wasted by not using the ice in drinks.\n\n1. We know that 1 gallon of water freezes at 30\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) to make 1 gallon of ice.\n2. The energy required to freeze 1 gallon of water is approximately 100 kWh (100,000 Wh).\n3. Therefore, the energy required to make 1 gallon of ice is 100 kWh.\n4. In the United States, each person consumes about 100 gallons of drinking water per day.\n5. So, the total energy wasted daily by not using the ice in drinks is 100 kWh/person * 300 million people = 30,000 GWh (30,000,000,000 Wh).\n\nNow we need to convert this value to an energy unit that is more appropriate for the question.\n\n1. We know that 1 GWh = 1,000,000 kWh.\n2. Therefore, 30,000 GWh = 30,000,000 kWh.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how much energy is wasted each year.\n\n1. There are 365 days in a year.\n2. So, the total energy wasted daily by not using the ice in drinks is 30,000,000 kWh/day * 365 days/year = 10,950,000,000 kWh/year.\n\nNow we can answer the question.\n\n(A) 6*10^8 J\n(B) 6*10^11 J\n(C) 6*10^14 J\n(D) 6*10^17 J\n\nThe correct answer is 10,950,000,000 kWh/year or 10,950,000,000 J/year.\n\nOur answer is (A) 6*10^8 J.",
