            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to look at the requirements for separate disclosure in general purpose financial statements.\n\nIf a company has multiple operating segments, it may choose to disclose each separately or in a combined manner. The purpose of separate disclosure is to provide more detail about the performance of each segment, which can help users of the financial statements better understand the company's operations.\n\nIn this case, Swift has three operating segments: A, B, and C. For the year ended December 31, year 2, the company has reported revenue of $177, with profits or losses of $74 and assets of $1350.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\n(A) A and B only.\n(B) A and C only.\n(C) B and C only.\n(D) A B and C.\n\nTo determine which segments need to be separately disclosed, we should consider the threshold for separate disclosure, which is usually 10% of the total revenue or profits for each segment.\n\nIf we apply this threshold to Swift's segments:\n\n- Segment A: $42 (10% of $177)\n- Segment B: $121 (10% of $177)\n- Segment C: $14 (10% of $177)\n\nAll three segments meet the 10% threshold for separate disclosure. Therefore, Swift's segments A, B, and C are required to be separately disclosed in its December 31, year 2 financial statements.\n\n(D) A B and C.",

While it is important for a CPA firm to have quality control policies regarding client relationships, this option is not specific to auditing practice.\n\n(B) Professional skepticism of management: This involves questioning the decisions and actions of management, which is a crucial part of an auditor's role. This policy helps ensure that the auditor detects any potential issues or fraud within the management's actions. This option is specific to auditing practice and is a quality control procedure that CPA firms should have in place.\n\n(C) Computer information processing: This refers to the use of computers and technology in the auditing process, which is not specific to auditing practice as a whole. While technology can be used in various aspects of a CPA firm's operations, this option is not a quality control procedure relevant to auditing practice.\n\n(D) Efficiency of organizational structures: This involves the organization and structure of the CPA firm itself, which is important for overall efficiency and effectiveness.

While this might be true in some jurisdictions, it is not the case in the United States, where shareholders must have a legitimate reason for their inspection.\n\n(B) Is conditioned upon the demanding shareholder owning at least $5000 worth of stock: This option is incorrect because the requirement to own a certain amount of stock is not a condition for the right to inspect the books and records in most jurisdictions.\n\n(C) Requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose: This option seems to be the most accurate, as shareholders in the United States generally have the right to inspect the books and records for the purpose of making informed decisions as shareholders.\n\n(D) Exists only when fraud or illegality is alleged: While this might be true in some cases, it is not the general rule.
