            "model_answer": "To find the empirical formula of the compound, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of atoms of each element in the compound.\n2. Write the empirical formula in the form \"CxHyOz\".\n\nStep 1: Determine the total number of atoms of each element in the compound.\nWe are given the total mass of the compound as 29.05 g. We are also given the mass of the carbon as 18.02 g and the mass of the hydrogen as 3.03 g. We need to find the mass of the oxygen.\n\nSince the total mass of the compound is 29.05 g, and the mass of the carbon is 18.02 g, the mass of the hydrogen is 3.03 g, and the mass of the oxygen is:\n\n29.05 g (total mass) - 18.02 g (carbon) - 3.03 g (hydrogen) = 8.00 g (oxygen)\n\nNow we need to find the total number of atoms of each element in the compound. We know that 1 g of an element contains 1 mol (mole) of atoms. So, we can find the number of atoms of each element by dividing the mass of the element by the mass of 1 mol.\n\nNumber of carbon atoms = (18.02 g * 1 mol) / 1 g = 18 mol\nNumber of hydrogen atoms = (3.03 g * 1 mol) / 1 g = 3 mol\nNumber of oxygen atoms = (8.00 g * 1 mol) / 1 g = 8 mol\n\nStep 2: Write the empirical formula in the form \"CxHyOz\".\nNow that we know the number of atoms of each element, we can write the empirical formula of the compound. The empirical formula is written as \"CxHyOz\", where x, y, and z are the numbers of atoms of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, respectively.\n\nSince we know that there are 18 carbon atoms, 3 hydrogen atoms, and 8 oxygen atoms, we can write the empirical formula as:\n\nC18H3O8\n\nSo the answer is (C) C2H6O3.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "1. First, we need to find the molar mass of propane (C3H8). We can do this by multiplying the molar mass of each element (carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine) by their respective coefficients in the molecule.\n   - Carbon: 12.00 g/mol \u00d7 1 = 12.00 g/mol\n   - Hydrogen: 1.01 g/mol \u00d7 8 = 8.08 g/mol\n   - Chlorine: 16.99 g/mol \u00d7 1 = 16.99 g/mol\n   - Total molar mass = (12.00 + 8.08 + 16.99) g/mol = 36.07 g/mol\n\n2. Next, we need to convert the mass of propane from grams to moles. We do this by dividing the mass by the molar mass of propane (36.07 g/mol).\n   - Mass of propane = 6.2 g\n   - Number of moles = Mass of propane / Molar mass of propane\n   - Number of moles = 6.2 g / 36.07 g/mol \u2248 0.172 mol\n\n3. Finally, we need to round the number of moles to the nearest whole number. Since 0.172 mol is closer to 0.2 mol than 0 mol, we round up to the nearest whole number.\n   - Number of moles = 1 mol\n\nThe answer is (A) 14.1 mol.",

In the case of SO2Cl2, this process is the decomposition reaction mentioned in the question.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Increasing the initial concentration of SO2Cl2: This means that more SO2Cl2 is present at the beginning of the reaction. Since the reaction is first order overall, this means that the reaction rate constant (k) is proportional to the concentration (c), i.e., k = c. Increasing the concentration will make the reaction go faster, which means the half life will decrease, not increase.\n\n(B) Increasing the temperature at which the reaction occurs: This means that the reaction will take place faster at a higher temperature. As mentioned earlier, the reaction is first order overall, so increasing the temperature will make the reaction go faster, which means the half life will decrease, not increase.\n\n(C) Decreasing the overall pressure in the container: This means that there is less pressure on the reaction.
