            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the forces acting on the whiffle ball and how they change with time.\n\n1. At the highest point, the ball is at its maximum height and has reached its maximum speed. Therefore, statement I is false because the ball's speed is not zero at the highest point.\n\n2. At the highest point, the ball's acceleration is momentarily zero due to the air resistance. However, as the ball falls back down, the acceleration is no longer zero because the ball is now undergoing free fall under the influence of gravity. Therefore, statement II is false.\n\n3. The time taken to travel up to the highest point is shorter than the time taken to fall back down because the ball's acceleration is zero during the ascent, allowing it to reach its maximum height in a shorter time. Therefore, statement III is true.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the correct answer is (C) I & II only.",

Calculate the electric force between the particles.\n2. Determine the charge of each particle.\n3. Calculate the ratio of the forces.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the electric force between the particles.\nThe formula for the electric force between two point charges is given by:\n\nF = k * (q1 * q2) / r^2\n\nwhere k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges of the particles, and r is the distance between them.\n\nWe are given that the distance between the particles is 4 m, and the charge of particle A is 2Q. Therefore, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nF_A = (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (2Q * Q) / (4 m)^2\n\nStep 2: Determine the charge of each particle.\nWe are given that the charge of particle B is Q. We need to find the charge of particle A. Since the total charge of the system is conserved (Q + 2Q = 3Q), we can determine the charge of particle A by dividing the total charge by 3:\n\nQ = 3Q / 2\nQ = 1.5Q\n\nNow we know that the charge of particle A is 1.5Q, and the charge of particle B is Q.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the ratio of the forces.\nWe need to find the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B. The magnitude of the electric force can be found by taking the square root of the force:\n\n|F_A| = sqrt(F_A)\n|F_B| = sqrt(F_B)\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of these magnitudes:\n\nRatio = |F_A| / |F_B|\n\nSince we already calculated the forces in step 1, we can directly plug in the values:\n\nRatio = sqrt(F_A) / sqrt(F_B)\n\nNow we can find the answer by simply calculating the ratio:\n\nRatio = sqrt((8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (2Q * Q) / (4 m)^2) / sqrt((8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2) * (Q * Q) / (4 m)^2)\n\nRatio = (2/1)\n\nRatio = 2\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) 2:01",
