            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To identify a newly discovered virus - (A)\n\nReasoning:\nNext generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool that allows researchers to rapidly and accurately sequence and analyze the genome of a sample. One of the most common applications of NGS is to identify newly discovered viruses. By comparing the genome of a newly discovered virus to known viral sequences, NGS can help researchers understand the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and develop effective strategies for controlling their spread.\n\n(B) To search for drug resistant mutants - This is a possible application as well, but option A is more specific and focused on identifying newly discovered viruses.\n\n(C) To identify quasi species viruses - This is another possible application, but again, option A is more specific and focused on newly discovered viruses.\n\n(D) Cannot be used - This is incorrect because NGS is indeed used in many applications, including the ones mentioned above.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through each option step-by-step and see which one is most helpful in controlling for in a clinical trial.\n\n(A) Placebo effect: Randomization of study subjects can help control for placebo effect by ensuring that subjects receiving the actual treatment and those receiving the placebo have similar characteristics and backgrounds. This helps to reduce the potential for bias and confounding.\n\n(B) Recall bias: Randomization can also help control for recall bias by ensuring that subjects with different characteristics (e.g., those with better or worse memory) are distributed equally across the treatment groups. This helps to reduce the potential for bias in the trial results.\n\n(C) Non-compliance: Randomization can help control for non-compliance by ensuring that subjects who are more likely to drop out of the trial are distributed equally across the treatment groups. This helps to reduce the potential for bias in the trial results.\n\n(D) Effect modification (interaction): Randomization can help control for effect modification (interaction) by ensuring that subjects with different characteristics (e.g., those with different risk factors) are distributed equally across the treatment groups. This helps to reduce the potential for bias in the trial results.\n\nBased on the explanations above, randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for (A) Placebo effect, (B) Recall bias, and (D) Effect modification (interaction).",

They are known to cause warts and, in some cases, can lead to cancer.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Replicate in dividing cells and encodes three oncogenic proteins E5, E6 and E7: While it is true that some papilloma viruses can replicate in dividing cells and encode oncogenic proteins, this answer is too specific and may not account for all papilloma viruses.\n\n(B) Integrates viral genome into cellular DNA: This is not a direct cause of cancer in papilloma viruses. The integration of viral genome into cellular DNA might happen during the infection, but it is not the primary cause of cancer in papilloma viruses.\n\n(C) Has an oncogene able to initiate cancer: Papilloma viruses can contain oncogenic proteins, such as E5, E6, and E7, which can potentially initiate cancer. This is a more accurate answer.\n\n(D) Acts as a co factor for a cellular oncogene: While some papilloma viruses can act as a co-factor for cellular oncogenes, this is not a primary cause of cancer in papilloma viruses.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer is (C) - Papilloma family of viruses causes cancer by having an oncogene able to initiate cancer.",
