            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand what each term means and then match it with the correct option.\n\n(A) Arboreal refers to something related to trees, such as an arboreal mammal. This term is not related to the face.\n\n(B) Prognathous refers to an animal or person with a protruding lower jaw or chin. This term is related to the face and could be a possible answer.\n\n(C) Diastema is a term used in zoology to describe a gap between two bones. This term is not related to the face.\n\n(D) Mandible is the lower jaw or chin in humans and animals. This term is related to the face and could be a possible answer.\n\nNow, let's examine the options (B) and (D). Both terms are related to the face and could be the answer. However, upon further research (or looking at the options), we can see that option (B) is the correct one as it refers to a protruding lower face, whereas option (D) refers to the lower jaw or chin as a whole, and not necessarily the face as a whole.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(B) prognathous.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the key differences between the Levallois technology and the previous one, called the Acheulean technology.\n\nThe Levallois technology is named after its inventor, Marcel Levallois. It is a lithic technology (stone tool-making) that originated in Africa around 300,000 years ago and later spread to Eurasia. The Levallois technology is characterized by its production of small, sharp, and elongated flakes from large stone cores, which are then used as knives or scrapers.\n\nNow let's look at the options:\n\n(A) producing core tools to producing flakes.\nThis option describes the shift from the Acheulean technology to the Levallois technology. The Acheulean technology focused on producing large, dull axes, while the Levallois technology shifted the emphasis to producing smaller, sharper tools like flakes. This is the correct answer.\n\n(B) producing pottery to producing clothing.\nThis option talks about a shift from pottery-making to clothing-making, which is not relevant to the Levallois technology. The Levallois technology was focused on stone tools, not pottery or clothing.\n\n(C) producing arrows to producing spear points.\nThis option describes a shift from making arrows to producing spear points, which is not relevant to the Levallois technology. The Levallois technology was focused on small, sharp flakes, not arrow or spear points.\n\n(D) larger, duller axes to smaller, sharper ones.\nThis option talks about a shift from larger, dull axes to smaller, sharper ones, which is a characteristic of the Levallois technology itself, not a shift from something else.\n\nSo, the answer is (A).",
