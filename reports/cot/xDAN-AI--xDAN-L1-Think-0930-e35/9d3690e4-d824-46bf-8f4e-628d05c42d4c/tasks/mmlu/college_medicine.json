            "model_answer": "First, let's examine each option and see which one is the most logical for how the body compensates for increased environmental temperature.\n\n(A) Decreasing salt retention: While it is true that the body may retain less salt during high-temperature conditions, this is not the primary way the body compensates for increased temperature.\n\n(B) Increasing respiration rate: Breathing rate does increase during physical exertion or high temperatures to increase oxygen intake, but this is not the primary way the body compensates for temperature increase.\n\n(C) Increasing heart rate: Increased heart rate is a common response to stress or high temperatures as it helps to increase blood flow to vital organs and working muscles. This seems like a strong candidate for the answer.\n\n(D) Increasing water lost through skin: While it is true that the body loses more water through sweating during high temperatures, this is not the primary way the body compensates for the increased temperature.\n\nBased on the analysis, the body compensates for increased environmental temperature by:\n\n(C) Increasing heart rate.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) uptake and oxidation by other tissues.\n\nReasoning:\nLactate is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism that occurs in muscles during intense physical activity. When lactate leaves the muscle and enters the circulation, it is transported to other tissues, primarily the liver. In the liver, lactate is converted to pyruvate and subsequently to acetyl-CoA through a series of metabolic steps. This acetyl-CoA is then used to synthesize glucose and other molecules. So, the main fate of lactate that leaves the muscle and enters the circulation is its uptake and oxidation by other tissues.",

However, it is not the primary site for transcription of DNA to mRNA.\n\n(C) in the nucleus: The nucleus is the organelle that contains the majority of the cell's genetic material, including the DNA.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand the structure of a double stranded molecule of DNA and the types of bases present in it.\n\nA double stranded molecule of DNA has two strands, each made up of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. There are four types of nitrogenous bases in DNA - adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Out of these, adenine (A) and guanine (G) are purines, while cytosine (C) and thymine (T) are pyrimidines.\n\nNow, let's look at the ratio of purines : pyrimidines in a double stranded molecule of DNA.\n\nIn a typical DNA molecule, the number of purines (adenine and guanine) is approximately 1:1 with respect to the number of pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine). This is because the molecule needs to have a certain balance of positive and negative charges to maintain its structure.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n(D) always 1:1.",

Water (C) is essential for life, but it is not directly involved in the process of cellular respiration.\n\nNow, let's think about the situation where oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell.\n\nIn the absence of oxygen, the cell cannot produce the necessary ATP through cellular respiration.\n\nSince water (C) is not directly involved in the process of cellular respiration, it will not stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell.\n\nPyruvate (B) is a product of the cellular respiration process, and without oxygen, the cell will not be able to produce pyruvate (B).\n\nTherefore, pyruvate (B) will stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

While it is true that blood lactate concentration may not increase much beyond this value, it is not always the case, so we cannot conclude this as the correct answer.\n\n(B) This option claims that the concentration is usually lower at the end of the game than at the end of the first half. This may be true for some games, but it is not a general rule for all soccer games, so we cannot confirm this as the correct answer.\n\n(C) According to this option, the concentration is usually higher at the end of the game than at the end of the first half. This is a likely scenario, as the second half of a soccer game often sees players more fatigued and therefore producing higher blood lactate concentrations.\n\n(D) This option states that the blood lactate concentration increases throughout the game as the players become more fatigued. This is a probable scenario, as soccer requires continuous physical effort, leading to increased fatigue and consequently higher blood lactate concentrations.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely answer is:\n\n(C) is usually higher at the end of the game than at the end of the first half.",

The duration of this period depends on the individual and the type of exercise being performed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n(A) 1-2 seconds: This seems too short, as ATP and phosphocreatine can provide energy for a longer period of time, especially during intense exercise.\n(B) 5-10 seconds: This seems more plausible, as the energy generated from the breakdown of these phosphates can indeed sustain exercise for about 5-10 seconds, depending on the individual and the type of exercise.\n(C) 30-40 seconds: This seems too long, as the energy from these phosphates would not last that long, especially during maximal exertion exercise.\n(D) 50-60 seconds: This seems too long as well, considering that the energy from these phosphates would not last that long during maximal exertion exercise.\n\nBased on the information provided and the evaluation of the options, the answer is:\n\n(B) 5-10 seconds.",
