            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) the atria are contracting: The atria are the upper chambers of the heart. They do not contract during the diastole phase, which is the relaxed phase of the heart. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n(B) the vessels are contracted: Vessels are the blood vessels that carry blood throughout the body. They do not contract during the diastole phase, but rather, they relax. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n(C) the right ventricle is relaxed: The right ventricle is the lower right chamber of the heart. It contracts during the systole phase to push blood out into the pulmonary arteries. So, it cannot be relaxed during the diastole phase when the left ventricle is contracting. This option is incorrect.\n\n(D) the arteries have elastic recoil: Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. They do have elastic recoil, which helps to cushion the blood flow and prevent the heart from having to work as hard during the systole phase. This option is correct.\n\nSo, the answer is (D).",

So, this statement is true.\n\n(B) It causes a large multi-nodular goitre\n- Graves' Disease is known to cause a goiter, but whether it is always associated with a large multi-nodular goitre is not entirely accurate. So, this statement is not entirely true.\n\n(C) It is commoner in males than females\n- Graves' Disease is more common in females than males. So, this statement is false.\n\n(D) In the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck'\n- 'Derbyshire Neck' is a term used to describe a type of thyroiditis that is associated with a severe neck pain. It is not directly related to Graves' Disease. So, this statement is false.\n\nBased on the evaluation of each option, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia",

            "model_answer": "First, let's understand what a muscle fibre is. A muscle fibre is a cylindrical structure that contracts when stimulated by a nerve impulse. This contraction is mediated by the binding of actin and myosin, which are two protein filaments present inside the muscle fibre.\n\nNow, let's examine each option:\n\n(A) the nerve stimulus is removed: When the nerve stimulus is removed, the muscle fibre will stop contracting, but it doesn't necessarily relax.\n\n(B) the nerve stimulus is too forceful: If the nerve stimulus is too forceful, it could damage the muscle fibre, but it doesn't necessarily make it relax.\n\n(C) the actin binding sites are uncovered: When the actin binding sites are uncovered, it allows actin to bind to myosin, which leads to the relaxation of the muscle fibre.\n\n(D) the actin binding sites are saturated: When the actin binding sites are saturated, it means that there are no more sites left to bind actin. This would prevent the muscle fibre from relaxing.\n\nBased on the explanations, the correct answer is (C) the actin binding sites are uncovered.",

            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) A decrease in the cell concentration of ADP (adenosine triphosphate) can lead to fatigue during high-intensity exercise. This is because ADP is a key energy source for muscles, and depleting it can cause muscular fatigue.\n\n(B) Inhibition of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production would also lead to fatigue. ATP is the primary energy currency for cells, and if its production is inhibited, cells will have less energy to function.\n\n(C) A failure of the ATP supply to match the demand could also cause fatigue. This is because ATP is used up quickly during high-intensity exercise, and if the body isn't able to replace it fast enough, fatigue will set in.\n\n(D) Lack of skill doesn't directly relate to the cause of fatigue in high-intensity exercise. Skill is more about the ability to perform a task, not about the energy production or supply.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\nThe fundamental cause of fatigue in high-intensity exercise is either (A) a fall in the cell concentration of ADP or (B) inhibition of ATP production. Both options are valid, but (A) is slightly more specific as it directly addresses the cellular level where energy is produced and used.",

Oxygen is not required for glycolysis, as it is a process occurring in the cytosolic space without the need for oxygen.\n\n(B) The conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA does not involve oxygen. This process is part of the citric acid cycle and is catalyzed by the enzyme fatty acid oxidation.\n\n(C) The tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle) is another name for the citric acid cycle. This cycle is responsible for the metabolism of pyruvate, which is derived from glycolysis, and it does involve oxygen. Oxygen is required for the process of oxidation in the citric acid cycle.\n\n(D) Glycogenolysis is the metabolic pathway that breaks down glycogen, a complex carbohydrate, into glucose. This process is catalysed by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase and does not involve oxygen.\n\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that oxygen is used in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle).\n\n### Answer:\n\nC",

Pharmacological agents are used to interfere with neurotransmitters.\n3. We are looking for specific neurotransmitters and pharmacological agents that influence fatigue development.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) Acetyl choline and noradrenaline: Acetyl choline is involved in learning and memory, and noradrenaline is involved in the \"fight or flight\" response. There is no direct evidence to suggest that they influence fatigue development.\n\n(B) Dopamine and acetyl choline: Dopamine is involved in motivation, reward, and reinforcement, while acetyl choline is involved in learning and memory. Although dopamine may play a role in fatigue development, acetyl choline is not directly related to fatigue.\n\n(C) Glutamate and serotonin: Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, while serotonin is involved in mood regulation, appetite, and sleep. Both have been implicated in fatigue development, particularly in the context of chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\n(D) Dopamine and serotonin: Although both dopamine and serotonin are involved in various aspects of brain function, there is little evidence to suggest that they directly influence fatigue development.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer is:\n\n(C) Glutamate and serotonin.",

Phosphocreatine (PC) is a high-energy phosphate that plays a crucial role in muscle contraction, particularly during high-intensity or short-duration exercise.\n2. After a period of intense exercise, the PC in muscles becomes depleted, and resynthesis begins to restore it.\n3. Resynthesis is a process in which ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is converted back into PC.\n4. The rate of resynthesis depends on the intensity of the exercise and the energy demands of the muscles.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) about 10 seconds: This option seems too short for the resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise, as it would not provide enough time for the muscles to recover.\n\n(B) about 30 seconds: This option seems more plausible, as it allows for a more adequate recovery period for the muscles to resynthesize phosphocreatine.\n\n(C) about 1 minute: This option seems too long, as the resynthesis process should be relatively fast to meet the energy demands of the muscles during high-intensity exercise.\n\n(D) about 4 minutes: This option seems excessive, as it would take too long for the resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n(B) about 30 seconds.",
