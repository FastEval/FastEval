The furthest thing from the paperclip is the red booklet.\n2. The second-farthest thing is the burgundy plate, which is directly to the right of the paperclip.\n3. The third-farthest thing is the fuchsia necklace, which is directly to the right of the burgundy plate.\n4. The fourth-farthest thing is the blue pencil, which is directly to the right of the fuchsia necklace.\n5. The fifth-farthest thing is the gold mug, which is directly to the right of the blue pencil.\n6. The sixth-farthest thing is the teal paperclip, which is directly to the right of the gold mug.\n\nThus, the color of the thing furthest from the paperclip is red.\n\nAnswer: (A) red",
