Since she ate one per day, she ate 7 eggs per week.\n\nNow we need to figure out how many weeks have passed since she bought the eggs. There are 4 weeks in a month and 12 months in a year. So, there are 4*12 = 48 weeks in a year.\n\nWe know that there are 52 weeks in a year, so we need to find out how many weeks have passed. We can do this by dividing the total number of weeks in a year by the number of weeks that have passed. So, 52/48 = 1.041667. This means that 1 week and 4 days have passed since Jane bought the eggs.\n\nNow we need to find out the date one week from today.

So, we need to subtract 6 days from the date of purchase (05/09/2017).\n\n05/09/2017 - 6 days = 04/25/2017\n\nSo, one week from today would be 04/25/2017. However, this is not one of the options.

            "model_answer": "First, we need to find out how many days there are between today and the first day of the year 1973. Since today is 3/5, it means that 1973 has already started. So, there are 18 days in January and 14 days in February (till 3/5).\n\nSo, there are 18 + 14 = 32 days between 1/1/1973 and 3/5/1973.\n\nNow, since it is Jane's second time in the year 1973 to see a meteor shower, it means that there is another meteor shower on 3/6/1973. We need to find out how many days there are between 3/5 and 3/6. Since there are 24 hours in a day, there are 24 hours between 3/5 and 3/6.\n\nSo, there are 24 hours * 2 = 48 hours between 3/5 and 3/6.\n\nTherefore, there are 32 days + 48 hours = 80 days in total from 1/1/1973 to 3/6/1973.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many days there are between 3/6/1973 and the end of the year 1973 (12/31). Since there are 365 days in a year, there are 365 - 80 = 285 days between 3/6/1973 and 12/31/1973.\n\nSo, there are 285 days + 24 hours = 309 days in total from 1/1/1973 to 12/31/1973.\n\nTherefore, there are 365 - 309 = 56 days left in 1973 when considering both meteor showers.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many days there are between 1/1/1973 and 3/2/1973 (the day before the second meteor shower). Since there are 365 days in a year, there are 365 - 56 = 313 days between 1/1/1973 and 3/2/1973.\n\nSo, there are 313 days + 24 hours = 337 days in total from 1/1/1973 to 3/2/1973.\n\nTherefore, there are 365 - 337 = 28 days left in 1973 after 3/2/1973.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many days there are between 3/2/1973 and 3/5/1973. Since there are 365 days in a year, there are 365 - 28 = 337 days between 3/2/1973 and 3/5/1973.\n\nSo, there are 337 days + 24 hours = 361 days in total from 1/1/1973 to 3/5/1973.\n\nTherefore, there are 365 - 361 = 4 days left in 1973 after 3/5/1973.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many days there are between 3/5/1973 and 12/31/1973. Since there are 365 days in a year, there are 365 - 4 = 361 days between 3/5/1973 and 12/31/1973.\n\nSo, there are 361 days + 24 hours = 385 days in total from 1/1/1973 to 12/31/1973.\n\nTherefore, there are 365 - 385 = -20 days left in 1973 after 12/31/1973.\n\nSince we cannot have negative days, there must be an error in the given options. However, if we ignore this error and continue with the calculations, we would find that the answer should be:\n\n(A) 03/08/1983\n\nThis is because there are 385 days in total from 1/1/1973 to 3/8/1983, which is equal to 365 days (1 year) and 20 extra days.",
