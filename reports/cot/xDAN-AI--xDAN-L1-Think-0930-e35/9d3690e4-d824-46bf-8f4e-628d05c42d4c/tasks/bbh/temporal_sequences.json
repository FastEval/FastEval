Jessica woke up at 6am, so she could have potentially gone to the bookstore at any time between 6am and the time the bookstore closed (9pm).\n2. However, we know that she was seen by Andrew at 9am, which means she couldn't have gone to the bookstore at that hour or earlier.\n3. Between 9am and 10am, Jessica was seen by Susan at the gym, so she couldn't have gone to the bookstore during that time either.\n4. Between 10am and 11am, Jessica was seen by David at the Statue of Liberty, so she couldn't have gone to the bookstore during that time either.\n5. Between 11am and 1pm, Jessica was seen by Linda at the deli, so she could have potentially gone to the bookstore during that time.\n6. Between 1pm and 2pm, Jessica was seen by James at the Eiffel Tower, so she couldn't have gone to the bookstore during that time either.\n7. Therefore, the only possible time for Jessica to have gone to the bookstore is between 8am and 9am, as it's the only time period when she wasn't seen by someone else.",
