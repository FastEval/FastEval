Sarcasm is often found when something is said in a way that contrasts with the intended meaning.\n\nIn statement (A), the minimal wobbling is actually a negative thing (as it indicates the bike might not be safe), but the statement is saying it's not enough to suggest that the bike was unsafe. This is a sarcastic statement because it's saying something negative (about the bike's safety) while claiming that it's not important enough to worry about.\n\nIn statement (B), the statement is saying that the wobbling was quite a bit, but still, it wasn't enough to say that the bike was unsafe. This is also a sarcastic statement because it's saying something negative (about the bike's safety) while claiming that it's not important enough to worry about.\n\nSo, both statements are sarcastic.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

The word \"super\" in this context still implies a strong level of agreement or emphasis, while \"fun\" suggests amusement or enjoyment.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements to identify any differences in tone or intent.\n\n(A) The tone of this statement is more serious, as it's discussing the issue of sexism in the context of the internet. The use of the word \"sexist\" implies a criticism of the situation being described.\n\n(B) The tone of this statement is lighter, as it's describing the assumption of everyone being male as a potential source of amusement or enjoyment.

The use of \"super\" doesn't indicate any sarcasm, but rather emphasis on the issue.\n\n(B) This statement is sarcastic, as it's describing the assumption of everyone being male as something funny or enjoyable.

This action is counterintuitive, as increasing taxes would place additional financial strain on small businesses that are already struggling.

A True demagogue\nIn this statement, the person is being compared to Hitler, but this time with the word \"demagogue\" instead of \"warrior.\" A demagogue is someone who is very skilled at convincing people to follow their ideas, but may not always have the best interests of those people in mind.

            "model_answer": "First, let's examine each option:\n\n(A) You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the elephants, that woefully endangered species\nThis statement sarcastically comments on feeding elephants, an action that is usually associated with a zookeeper or someone who is taking care of elephants in a non-sarcastic manner. The mention of the elephants being \"woefully endangered\" adds a sarcastic twist to the statement, as it emphasizes the absurdity of someone claiming to be feeding elephants in a sarcastic manner.\n\n(B) You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the trolls, that woefully endangered species\nThis statement sarcastically comments on feeding trolls, an action that is usually not associated with a zookeeper or someone who is taking care of trolls in a non-sarcastic manner. The mention of the trolls being \"woefully endangered\" adds a sarcastic twist to the statement, as it emphasizes the absurdity of someone claiming to be feeding trolls in a sarcastic manner.\n\nBoth options have a sarcastic twist to them due to the mention of \"woefully endangered\" species. However, option (A) is less likely to be interpreted as sarcastic because it sarcastically comments on feeding elephants, which is usually not associated with a zookeeper or someone who is taking care of elephants in a non-sarcastic manner. On the other hand, option (B) sarcastically comments on feeding trolls, which is usually not associated with a zookeeper or someone who is taking care of trolls in a non-sarcastic manner. Therefore, the answer is (B).",

The word \"beneficial\" in this context suggests a positive tone.\n\nNow, let's determine which statement is sarcastic:\n\nSince option (A) has a negative tone and option (B) has a positive tone, option (A) is sarcastic because it is expressing an ironic or critical view of the situation.",

Yeah, no one is rewatching\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nIn statement (A), the film has low sales and no one is rewatching it, which seems like a negative thing. The word \"yeah\" afterward suggests a sarcastic tone.\n\nIn statement (B), the film has high sales and no one is rewatching it. This also seems like a negative thing, but the word \"yeah\" afterward still suggests a sarcastic tone.\n\nHowever, since statement (A) has a more logical connection to being sarcastic due to the negative aspect of low sales, it is more likely that statement (A) is sarcastic.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n(A)",
