After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished.

This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills.\nAt this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts\u2014one of international terrorism and one of military aggression\u2014present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together we will meet these threats to peace.\u2026\nThree basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.\nEach of these factors is important in its own right.

NATO was a military alliance of 19 North American and European countries formed in 1949 to deter and defend against aggression from the Soviet Union. In response to the challenges Carter described, the United States and other NATO countries increased their military spending and cooperation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, ultimately leading to the creation of the alliance. Carter's defeat in the next presidential election was not directly related to the situation he described, as he was reelected in 1980. An American invasion in the Middle East was also not directly related to the situation he described, as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was the primary concern. Carter's victory in the next presidential election was a possible outcome of the situation he described, but it is not the most likely outcome.

An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it.
