            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. \n\nAesthetics is the study of sensory perception, especially of the beautiful, and the creative expression or application of this awareness. Objects that are important to our existence are those that are necessary for our survival, such as food, water, and shelter. Objects that are unimportant to most people are those that have little to no impact on our day-to-day lives. \n\nThe objects that are not considered essential to our existence are those that are not necessary for our survival or do not affect our daily lives. These objects may be considered as simply being decorative or having little value. \n\nThe object that is rarely viewed is not objects that are not considered essential to our existence or unimportant to most people. These objects are viewed daily, likely as part of our routine. Instead, the object that is rarely viewed is one that is aesthetically pleasing or thought-provoking, but may not be necessary for our existence or have practical use. Therefore, the answer is (D), rarely viewed. \nTherefore, the answer is (D), rarely viewed.",

He believed that the soul is the most important aspect of the human experience, and that an unexamined life is a tragedy because it leads to harm and suffering. Socrates believed that the soul must be examined and cultivated in order to achieve true happiness and fulfillment in life. Therefore, according to Socrates, an unexamined life is a tragedy because it results in grievous harm to the soul.",

Kant believed that the idea of moral goodness is based on the concept of universalizability. In other words, something is considered good if it can be universallyazi propagated. According to Kant, an action can be considered good only if the consequences of that action are themselves good, regardless of the intention or will behind the action. In this way, a good action is not necessarily one that is performed out of a good will, but rather one that produces good consequences, regardless of the will behind it.",

According to Plato, true beauty is not something that can be found in everyday objects, nor is it nonexistent. Instead, true beauty is something that exists beyond the physical world, in the realm of immortality. This view reflects Plato's belief in the superiority of the spiritual over the physical, and his belief that true beauty exists beyond the constraints of time and mortality.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) one knows that one\u2019s actions are wrong, but does them anyway. This is because a person who knows that their actions are wrong should still have the ability to control themselves and not act on that knowledge. On the other hand, a person who is unaware that their actions are wrong or does not have the ability to control themselves is considered to have committed a moral injustice, not incontinence. Continuously repeating the same actions without any conscience is considered incontinence (C), while acting out of fear or obligation (D) is not the same as incontinence.",

            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. Rawls proposes a theory of justice that seeks to determine the basic principles of a just society. According to Rawls, the original contract in the theory of justice is the agreement that the members of a society make at the outset of their cooperation, by which they establish a society through the establishment of a political institution that can adjudicate disputes and ensure that all members of society are treated fairly and equally. This agreement establishes the basic structure of the society, which then provides the foundations for establishing principles of justice and distributing resources.

This is because his principle focuses on the individual's responsibility to engage in actions that promote the well-being of others, rather than solely focusing on making alterations to societal structures which can be difficult to change. Changes to personal habits and social structures are both important steps towards promoting equality and justice for all, but implementing the principle requires both forms of change.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": First, we must determine what Socrates means by \"soul\" in relation to this statement. The Greek word for \"soul\" that Socrates uses is \"psyche,\" which is related to the English words \"psychic\" and \"spirit.\" In ancient Greek philosophy, the \"soul\" or \"psyche\" was the physical part of a person that was responsible for their thoughts, emotions, and personality. It was different from the \"psyche,\" which was an immaterial spirit or soul that was responsible for a person's character and dignity.\n\nIn this context, Socrates is likely referring to the physical harm that comes from not having proper nourishment, physical comfort, or resources. While these things can certainly contribute to a better life and a more fulfilled personality, they cannot directly harm the soul itself. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) courage.",

            "model_answer": ": Kant believes that morality requires us to act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws. This is because he believes that morality is based on the principle of the supreme worthiness of the moral law. Essentially, we are obligated to act in a way that is in line with the concept of the greatest happiness for all, and we should strive to make this principle universally applicable. By acting on maxims that we can will to become universal laws, we are ensuring that our actions are not simply self-serving, but are instead guided by a sense of universal morality and the greater good of all.
