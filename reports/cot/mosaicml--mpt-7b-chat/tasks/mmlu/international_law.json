            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": None of the above. The correct answer is (D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, which has the authority to determine the jurisdiction of a state with respect to crimes committed on vessels. The tribunal hears cases related to the Law of the Sea, including disputes over maritime claims and crimes committed at sea. However, its jurisdiction is not limited to crimes committed solely on a vessel, but rather extends to any crimes that have an effect on the maritime environment.<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis. R2P is a doctrine which calls upon states to take responsibility for protecting populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and other atrocities. In contrast, humanitarian intervention is a more limited strategy, and is defined as any action taken by states or NGOs to protect or promote human rights outside of their national borders. While both R2P and humanitarian intervention may involve the use of force, R2P is broader in scope and has a primary objective of protecting populations from mass atrocities. Additionally, R2P does not necessarily require the approval or support of the UN Security Council, whereas humanitarian intervention typically does. Therefore, R2P is a more comprehensive approach, whereas humanitarian intervention is more focused on providing assistance to those in need. The answer is (C).<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Great question! To answer this question, we need to understand what the UK Constitution is and its structure. The UK Constitution is composed of a number of different components, including primary and secondary legislation, conventions, judicial decisions, and certain \u201cunwritten rules\u201d that have developed over time. In other words, there is no single \u201cdocument\u201d that contains the entire UK Constitution; rather, it is a complex set of rules and principles that are scattered across a variety of different sources.  \nThat said, as the given options suggest, there are a number of key principles that do have a definitive place in the UK Constitution. Specifically, the UK Constitution is based on the idea of \u201cparliamentary sovereignty,\u201d which means that the UK Parliament is the ultimate source of power in the UK. This principle is enshrined in the ceremonial oath of the Queen (as head of state) and is also reflected in the UK Constitution\u2019s general powers provision. Additionally, the UK Constitution includes a number of specific protections and liberties, including the right to free speech and assembly, that are also crucial to understanding the UK Constitution.  \nFinally, it\u2019s worth mentioning that the UK Constitution is different from the US Constitution, which is both more codified and more closely associated with a popular \u201cBill of Rights.\u201d By contrast, the UK Constitution is much more flexible and dynamic, and can change over time through a variety of means. With that in mind, I would answer Option C: The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources. (Hint: I chose C because Option A is a more extreme view, and Option D is based on a historical fact that doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the current structure of the UK Constitution.)<|im_end|>",

This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes\n(C) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute\n(D) It is an obligation which concerns solely international courts and tribunals",

            "model_answer": "(C) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute.

            "model_answer": ": I'm happy to help! \n(A) Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three-judge to a one-judge formation. This is actually true! As part of the reforms of the European Convention on Human Rights, Protocol 14 established a single judge admissibility committee, as opposed to the previous practice of a three-judge committee.\n(B) Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility. This is also true! As part of the reforms of the European Convention on Human Rights, Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility, which is that any evidence or testimony presented must be relevant and necessary to prove the case.\n(C) Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights. False! Protocol 14 did not abolish the Commission of Human Rights, which remains an important part of the European human rights system. Instead, the Commission was replaced by the European Parliamentary Assembly, which was given the task of monitoring the Convention's implementation.\n(D) Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights. False! In fact, Protocol 14 did the opposite - it reduced the judicial term of office from 15 to 12 years. The measures were taken to ensure that the Court's judges remain independent and impartial, and to prevent any potential conflicts of interest. \nThe answer is (D) Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights.<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. To determine which of the options is the correct answer, we need to examine the definition of a rock under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). \nAccording to Article 121 (3) of UNCLOS, a rock is an island, islet, or grating of igneous rock or other geological formation underlying any suitable coral growth which meets one or more of the following conditions:\n- it is represented by sustainable human human habitation or economic life of its own\n- it has or is subject to a sustainable economic life of its own and is capable of sustaining human habitation\nNow, option (A) states that rocks are islands less than 10 square miles. This is incorrect. According to Article 121 (1) of UNCLOS, a rock is defined as a natural projection of the sea-floor or a submerged elevation of minimal area, exceeding 300 feet in steepest height and extending for at least three nautical miles. Therefore, a rock cannot be less than 10 square miles.\nOption (B) states that rocks are the islands that do not have any maritime zone. This is partly correct. According to Article 121 (1) of UNCLOS, rocks are not entitled to a maritime zone. However, they are entitled to an exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, which are not applicable to all types of islands.\nOption (C) states that rocks are islands which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and according to article 121 (3) have no Exclusive Economic Zone or continental shelf. This is correct. Rocks are classified as islands under UNCLOS, but they are not entitled to maritime zones or exclusive economic zones. However, rocks are entitled to an occupation zone, which is defined as a maritime zone extending up to a distance of 12 nautical miles from the baselines from which their maritime jurisdiction is determined, and a continental shelf extending to a depth of 200 meters.\nOption (D) states that rocks are small islands that can sustain human habitation. This is incorrect.<|im_end|>",

            "model_answer": ": Good question! Clearly (A) is incorrect as international legal personality refers to an entity\u2019s legal capacity within international law, and cannot be limited to States alone. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) - the term \u201cinternational legal personality\u201d is used to denote a legal, rather than physical, person under international law. In other words, international legal personality refers to the legal capacity of an entity (such as a corporation or an NGO) to enjoy rights and duties under international law and to be subject to jurisdiction and enforcement measures.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "OK, let's break this question down step-by-step. The UN has a number of mechanisms for advancing human rights, and this question asks for one of those mechanisms. We can start by identifying some of the possible options from the list given. The UN Human Rights Committee is an independent body that investigates and advises on human rights violations, but it does not enforce those rights directly. This leaves us with two other remaining options: the UN Human Rights Council, and the UN Universal Periodic Review. The UN Human Rights Council is a more active body that engages in advocacy, monitoring, and reporting on human rights around the world. It also convenes interactive dialogues with states on human rights issues. The UN Universal Periodic Review, on the other hand, is a voluntary process in which each UN member state is reviewed by the General Assembly every five years on its human rights record. Ultimately, we can see that the UN Universal Periodic Review is the treaty-based human rights mechanism being referenced in this question.<|im_end|>",
