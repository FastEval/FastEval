            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": The correct answer is (B) The flag State. The answer to this question is a legal term that relates to the jurisdiction of a State over crimes committed on vessels within its territorial waters or under its flag. The Flag State has a special legal responsibility for the safety and security of vessels under its flag and, accordingly, it is generally the State that enjoys jurisdiction in respect of criminal offenses committed on such vessels. This is reflected in the provisions of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS), which requires a flag State to ensure that ships under its flag comply with certain safety standards and to take appropriate action in the event of non-compliance.",

            "model_answer": ": \n\n(D) Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular Right. Justiciability is a legal term that refers to the legal power of a court or other authority to hear and determine a case. In other words, justiciability refers to whether a particular right is enforceable by the relevant rights holders, or whether the non-enforcement of the right conforms to principles of justice.\n\nCorrections: \nE: In short, justiciability refers to a legal authority's power to enforce a particular right or obligation. When a right or obligation is enforceable, it is said to be justiciable. In contrast, when a right or obligation is not enforceable, or is not enforced, it may be said to be unjustifiable or unenforceable.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": (D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not. R2P is a principle that obliges states to take responsibility for protecting civilians from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. It was enshrined in the UN Charter as a permanent norm of international law. In practice, R2P often involves international military intervention to prevent or punish mass atrocities. Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, is the practice of using military force to protect civilians from humanitarian crises in areas where a state is unable or unwilling to act. While both R2P and humanitarian intervention involve the use of force, R2P is legally binding and requires a higher threshold of coercion than humanitarian intervention.",

This is the only source of power for the UK Constitution. \n- Finally, the UK Parliament itself has no power to overturn acts of the sovereign, as that belongs solely to the sovereign. \nTherefore, the answer is (A).

The obligation to settle disputes peacefully applies to all disputes between States and is not restricted to disputes that are subject to international law or jurisdiction.
