The set of all divisors of the two integers is the set of all the integers that divide both x and y. \nSince we are looking for the set of common divisors, we need to find the divisors that are common to x and y. We can find these by multiplying the divisors of x by the divisors of y, and vice versa. \nFor example, for x=6 and y=3, the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 6. The divisors of 3 are 1, 3, and 9. Multiplying these, we get (1 x 1) and (1 x 3), (2 x 3), and (6 x 9).

The number of edges in a graph is called its degree, and a graph with no edges between any pair of nodes is called an undirected graph. \nIn this problem, we are given that the collection of all undirected graphs with 10 nodes and 6 edges has a maximum number of connected components (i.e., separate pieces of the graph) of 10, and a minimum number of connected components of 1. \nWe are also given that there is at most one edge between any pair of nodes.
