            "model_answer": "(A) 100 is the answer. Polyomaviruses are a group of smallDNA viruses that infect humans and other hosts. They are able to integrate their DNA into host chromosomes and become permanent parts of the host\u2019s DNA. Scientists have identified over 30 different polyomaviruses that infect humans, but the total number of distinct viruses is likely much higher, as new viruses are constantly being discovered. The polyomavirus that causes cervical cancer (Human polyomavirus/HPV) is just one of the many types of polyomavirus that infect humans. The answer is (A) 100.<|im_end|>",

            "model_answer": ": \n\n(B) Easier access to investigational drugs. \nThe success of AIDS activism in the U.S. was primarily driven by its advocacy efforts around issues like access to medication and treatment. The FDA reforms were a necessary but not sufficient condition for the advancement of AIDS treatment, as researchers and drug companies remained critical intermediaries in the process. Changes in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S. were also not applicable to AIDS activism specifically, as other medical issues and treatments also tightened regulations and facilitated access. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Easier access to investigational drugs, as it was one of the most significant outcomes of AIDS activism in the U.S. and paved the way for new medications and treatments to be developed.<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Thank you for asking. To answer this question, we first need to consider the leading causes of death worldwide. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) released the latest statistics on global mortality, which provide valuable insights into the causes of death across the globe. According to this data, respiratory infections are the leading cause of death globally, accounting for about 6 million deaths annually. This is followed closely by diarrhea diseases, which cause approximately 5 million deaths per year. While malaria is often considered one of the most deadly diseases, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, it only accounts for about 784,000 global deaths each year. Finally, while tuberculosis causes roughly 1.5 million deaths per year, it is only the 4th leading cause of death worldwide. Therefore, the answer is (A) respiratory infections, which account for 6 million deaths globally each year.<|im_end|>",
