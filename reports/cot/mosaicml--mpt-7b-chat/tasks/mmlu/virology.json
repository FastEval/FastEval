            "model_answer": ": \nOften, when advocating for a cause, it can lead to reform in a particular area. This was the case with AIDS activism in the U.S. The activists lobbied for changes in medical practice, such as the use of protease inhibitors and other treatments that were not readily available to those with HIV/AIDS at the time. They also pushed for more research into the disease and for more funding for HIV/AIDS programs. Additionally, they advocated for equal rights for those living with HIV/AIDS, including insurance coverage and equality in the workplace. Many of these changes resulted from AIDS activism in the U.S., leading to a more supportive and healthier community for those living with HIV/AIDS. \nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) all of the above.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": (B) Exclusively breast fed for six months. \n\nSince newborn infants in countries with limited access to safe water and low levels of education typically have a high risk of dehydration, it is recommended that they be exclusively breast fed for the first six months of life to optimize their hydration status. Breast milk is also the best source of nutrition for infants, and provides vital immunological and hormonal protections that help to prevent infections, improve growth and development, and reduce the risk of chronic illnesses later in life. While formula-fed infants may also receive doctor-prescribed foods and fluids as tolerated, exclusive bottle-feeding is not recommended for infants in this context, since it can increase their risk of diarrhoea and other dehydration-related complications. Therefore, while there may be certain situations in which breast milk should not be the sole source of nutrition for fetus or infant, such as in cases of poor health or specific allergies, the optimal choice for maximizing early development, health, and survival outcomes is to exclusively breast feed infants for the first six months of life.",

            "model_answer": ": Achieving effective change in a community is usually dependent on which of the following segments of society?\n\n(A) Innovators: Innovators are typically the first to embrace new ideas and are willing to take risks. They are often leaders and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Innovators are crucial to bringing about change in a community because they are the driving force behind innovation and progress.\n\n(B) Early adopters: Early adopters are willing to try new things and are often influenced by innovators. They are curious and open-minded, and are willing to take a chance on new ideas. Early adopters are also important to the success of change in a community because they help spread the word and develop support for new ideas.\n\n(C) Middle adopters: Middle adopters are more cautious and are less likely to be swayed by innovators or early adopters. They are more traditional and take a more cautious approach. Middle adopters are important to the success of change in a community because they bring practicality and realism to the table. They can help bridge the gap between innovators and early adopters and help make the change more feasible and achievable.\n\n(D) Late adopters: Late adopters are usually the last to adopt new ideas and are the most resistant to change. They tend to be more risk-averse and are slower to adopt new things. Late adopters are important to the success of change in a community because they can provide stability and provide a base of support for the change that has already taken place. However, late adopters can also be prohibitive to further change and will need to be won over in order to bring about the desired outcome.",

The most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is the ability to produce antibodies that can specifically recognize and bind to a specific invading pathogen, allowing for targeted destruction of the invader. Antibodies are important components of the adaptive immune system, but they alone are not sufficient for effective immune response to pathogens. T cells, a type of white blood cell, are essential for triggering a targeted immune response against pathogens. Memory T cells are T cells that remember previous infections and can quickly respond to future infections of the same pathogen. Clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells refers to the growth of identical copies of specific antibodies and/or T cells in response to a particular pathogen, and is an important aspect of adaptive immune response. Thus, the answer is (C) Memory T cells, which are responsible for the adaptation of the immune system to specific pathogens. R (Response)",

Interferons are naturally occurring proteins that can help stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells, and are sometimes used in combination with chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin.  Ribavirin is an antiviral drug that is used in combination with interferon and chemotherapy drugs such as pegylated interferon and ribavirin to treat chronic hepatitis C.  Lamivudine and emtricitabine are antivirals that are part of the medication zidovudine (AZT) which is a retroviral drug used in combination with chemotherapy drugs such as didanosine (ddI) to treat acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).  Entecavir and tenofovir are both nucleotide analog antiviral drugs used in combination with antiviral drugs such as lamivudine and emtricitabine to treat chronic hepatitis B.  Interferons are typically administered subcutaneously, whereas the other drugs mentioned are orally administered.  Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Interferon and ribavirin.",
