            "model_answer": ": Let's first work through each of the alternatives and determine which one is correct. \n(Step 1) We can begin by breaking down the statement into two parts: \"Marginal revenue equals marginal cost\" and \"at the point where\". \n(Step 2) The marginal revenue of a good is the additional revenue that is received by the producer when the quantity produced increases by one unit. The marginal cost is the additional cost that is incurred by the producer when the quantity produced increases by one unit. \n(Step 3) Therefore, the marginal revenue and marginal cost face each other at a certain quantity of production. \n(Step 4) Now let's consider the statement \"at the point where\". This means that we are looking for the quantity of production where marginal revenue and marginal cost are equal. \n(Step 5) So we can form a graph with marginal revenue on the y-axis and marginal cost on the x-axis, and then see where they intersect. \n(Step 6) Let's say that quantity of production is x units. Then the marginal revenue at x units is MRx, and the marginal cost at x units is MCx. \n(Step 7) Therefore, MRx > MCx at the point where marginal revenue and marginal cost are equal. \n(Step 8) Thus, Alternative (C) is correct. \n(Step 9) Alternative (B) is incorrect because marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost at all points on the graph. \n(Step 10) Alternative (D) is also incorrect because total revenue is at its highest point at the minimum point on the cost-quantity graph. \n(Step 11) Finally, Alternative (A) is incorrect because marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost at all points on the graph. \nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": \nFirst, let's differentiate between the marginal products of labor and capital. The marginal product of labor (MPL) is the additional output that is produced when we hire an additional unit of labor. Similarly, the marginal product of capital (MPK) is the additional output that is produced when we add one more unit of capital. \nFrom the information given, we know that the MPL is 200 and the MPK is 50. This means that 200 additional units of output are produced when we hire an additional unit of labor, and 50 additional units of output are produced when we add one more unit of capital. \nNow, we need to figure out which of the four possible combinations of actions to take will result in either a rise or fall in the MPL and MPK. \nLet's start with increasing capital and decreasing labor (i.e. (A) in the question). Initially, the MPL and MPK are at the same level, since we are at a point where the horizontal marginal product curve intersects the cost curve. When we add to the capital stock, the cost of production decreases, which allows us to produce more output. Since the MPL of labor is increasing at the same time as the MPK of capital, these two marginal products will move apart in a way that makes it so that the additional units of labor will produce less output and the additional units of capital will produce more output. Therefore, the MPL will rise as the MPK falls, resulting in a decrease in the MPK. Therefore, we should choose (A) as our answer. \nIf we instead choose to decrease capital and increase labor (i.e. (B) in the question), we would still be decreasing the MPK of capital at the same time as increasing the MPL of labor, which would lead to a decrease in the MPK. Therefore, we would choose (B) if that were the correct answer, but it is not given that this action would result in a rise or fall in the MPL. If we choose to",

A Nash equilibrium is a situation in which all the players in the game are satisfied with their outcomes, given the strategies of all other players.

To determine whether goods X and Y are normal, inferior, complementary, or substitute goods, we need to know more about the relationship between the two goods. \nWe know that the cross-price elasticity between goods X and Y is +2.0. Cross-price elasticity measures the percentage change in the quantity of one good demanded when the price of another good changes. A positive value indicates that the two goods are complements, while a negative value indicates that the two goods are substitutes. A zero value indicates that the two goods are neither complements nor substitutes.\nIn this case, the value of +2.0 indicates that goods X and Y are complements.

            "model_answer": ": \nThe answer is (D) results in an equilibrium that does not maximize the total benefit to society. \nExternality is a term used in economics to describe a phenomenon where an event or decision by one party has effects on another party that are not reflected in the pricing system. \nThere are three possible ways in which externality can affect the equilibrium price: \n- (A) causes the equilibrium price to be artificially high: This means that the externality causes a higher demand for the good or service than what the market would have otherwise anticipated, causing the price to rise. \n- (B) causes the equilibrium price to be artificially low: This is the opposite of (A) and means that the externality causes a lower demand for the good or service than what the market would have otherwise anticipated, causing the price to fall. \n- (C) exists when markets cannot reach equilibrium: This means that the externality causes interference in the market's ability to reach an equilibrium price, preventing the market from settling on a price that reflects the true demand for the good or service. \nThe answer (D) results in an equilibrium that does not maximize the total benefit to society refers to the fact that when there is an externality present, the equilibrium price does not necessarily reflect the maximum total benefit to society. In other words, the externality distorts the equilibrium price and leads to a suboptimal outcome that does not maximize the total benefit.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": \nTo determine which demand curve would face an oligopolist when rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase, we must consider the elasticity of demand. In a perfectly competitive market, the demand curve is perfectly elastic and will respond to a change in price by changing the quantity demanded. In an oligopoly, however, the demand curve is not perfectly elastic, as some customers may have to cut back on purchases if a price increase occurs. \nOption (D) would face the least amount of difficulty if rival firms follow price decreases but not price increases. This is because the demand curve in this case consists of two discontinuous segments, which means that there is a significant change in the quantity demanded at some price level. It is likely that a slight price decrease would not significantly affect the quantity demanded beyond this price level, but a price increase would result in a more severe reduction in demand.\nOption (A) is highly elastic, which means that any change in price would result in a significant Change in the quantity demanded. This would make it difficult for the oligopolist to lower prices without significantly impacting its demand.\nOption (B) is highly inelastic, which means that a change in price would result in a very small change in the quantity demanded. This would make it difficult for the oligopolist to increase prices without significantly impacting demand.\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",
