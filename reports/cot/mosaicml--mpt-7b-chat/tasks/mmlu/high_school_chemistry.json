            "model_answer": ": Thanks for asking! London dispersion forces are caused by (C) the uneven electron-to-proton ratio found on individual atoms of a molecule. Atoms with a higher proportion of electrons will have a more positive electron cloud and attract other positively charged ions or molecules. This results in a repulsion between molecules due to the charge separation as \"identical\" molecules attract each other due to ionic bonding. In contrast, molecules with similar electron distributions and equal numbers of electrons and nuclei (negatively charged) will attract each other due to metallic bonding.<|im_end|>",

Therefore, its atomic radius will be the average of the atomic radii of the two elements directly above and below it in the periodic table. The atomic radii of the elements in group 14 are 77 pm for silicon and 54 pm for germanium. The average of these two is 64 pm. However, since this problem assumes that carbon has an atomic radius of 77 pm, we can use this value directly. \nNext, we need to use the energy level diagram to determine the ion that will be formed when carbon is first ionized. The energy levels of an atom are represented by a series of lines that intersect at energy levels<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": Hund's rule is a set of rules that describe the behavior of electrons in a metal. The rule states that electrons will fill orbitals in such a way that the total angular momentum of the electrons in a given orbital is a multiple of the angular momentum quantum number (L). This ensures that the sum of the total spin of the electrons in a given orbital is equal to 1/2. The rules are named after the German physicist Walter Hund. \nHund's rule requires that no two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers (called 'spin-orbit') and that no two electrons with the same spin can occupy an orbital. This ensures that there are no unpaired electrons (which would be undesirable), and that the electrons have a total spin of 1/2 (which is the highest possible value, which is also desirable). \nHowever, Hund's rule also states that no two electrons can occupy separate orbitals. This is important because if this were allowed, then the electrons would not have a total spin of 1/2, and this would violate the third postulate of quantum mechanics (which relates to the behavior of particles at very small scales). Therefore, Hund's rule requires that no two electrons can occupy separate orbitals.<|im_end|>",

            "model_answer": "Thanks for the question! To answer it, we need to look at the electron configuration of each ion and see how it differs from the neutral species (which is the uncharged atom that each ion is derived from). \nThe neutral species of Rb (testing potash) has an electron configuration of 1s2 2s2 2p6. The positive ion Rb+ (the alkali metal testing alcohol) has an electron configuration of 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s1. \nThe neutral species of Se has an electron configuration of 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2.

The negative ion Sr2- has an electron configuration of 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p3 4s2 3d1.\nWe can see that each ion has a different number of electrons in the 3s and 3p subshells (which are both the outermost subshells). Therefore, we know that they must have the same electron configuration, and the only way for all of the ions to have different electron configurations is for them to have different numbers of electrons in the 3s and 3p subshells. The answer is therefore (A) Rb+ (the alkali metal testing alcohol).<|im_end|>",
