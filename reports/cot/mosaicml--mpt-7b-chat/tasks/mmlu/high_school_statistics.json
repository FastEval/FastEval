            "question": "The weight of an aspirin tablet is 300 milligrams according to the bottle label. An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim. Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(B) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n(D) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. I will approach this by simulation, which involves randomly generating weights for each tablet and calculating the probability that the value is greater than 1.54. Then I will use the definition of a hypothesis test to find the P-value.\n\nTo simulate the weights of the tablets, I will randomly generate seven numbers between 250 and 350 (inclusive). For the first tablet, I will choose the number 299, for the second, 300, for the third, 305, and so on until the seventh, 303. This is because the range of possible weights is between 250 and 350, but only 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, and 301 are actually possible given that it is a random sample of seven tablets.\n\nNow that I have simulated the weights of the tablets, I will calculate the probability that the value is greater than 1.54. For this, I will count how many times the value is greater than 1.54, and divide by the total number of simulations:\n\nP(t > 1.54) = 7 / 2500\n\nThe P-value, sometimes called the level of significance, is the probability of observing a value as extreme as or more extreme than the one actually observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In this case, the null hypothesis is that the manufacturer's claim is true, which means that the weights of the tablets are actually 300 milligrams. So we want to find the probability of observing seven weights between 250 and 350 that add up to less than or equal to 1.54, assuming that the weights are actually 300 milligrams. To do this, we will use the binomial distribution:\n\nP(t > 1.54) = 7 / 2500 * 2^(1001-5)\n\nTherefore the P-value is:\n\nP(t > 1.54) = 0.001\n\nThe answer is E (0.001).<|im_end|>",

            "question": "The waiting times for a new roller coaster ride are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": My answer is (D) 25.3 to 35 minutes. I can explain my reasoning in steps: First, we need to calculate the z-score associated with 100,000 riders. According to the normal distribution, the z-score of a random variable is equal to the ratio of the variable to the standard deviation. Thus, the z-score of 100,000 riders is:\n\nz = (100,000 - 75,000) / 10 = +1\n\nThis means that the waiting time for 100,000 riders is located 1 standard deviation above the mean. The shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is the part of the curve that corresponds to z = +1. To find that interval, we can use a normal distribution table or a software program that computes z-scores. According to a normal distribution table, the 99th percentile of the waiting time for 100,000 riders is 34.94 minutes. However, since we are looking for the shortest time interval, we should consider only the part of the curve that corresponds to values less than 34.94 minutes. This means that the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is between 25.3 and 35, which is (D) 25.3 to 35 minutes.<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": \nIn order to answer this question, we need to understand the concept of statistical power. Power is the probability of detecting a statistically significant difference between two groups when there is, in fact, a difference. In this case, the research hypothesis is that there is a difference between the two groups being tested. Since the null hypothesis is false, the researchers want to have as high a power as possible in order to reject the null hypothesis and draw a conclusion about the existence of the difference.\n\nWe can calculate the required sample size for the original study and the required sample size for the modified study using the following relationships:\n\nType I error = alpha = 0.05\nType II error = beta = 0.1\nEffect size = d = 0.5\nSample size for original study = (z_alpha/2)*(squared difference between groups)*(1/effect size) = 62\nSample size for modified study = (z_beta-1.96)/sqrt(between-subjects variance)*(effect size) = 125\n\nSince the effect size is the same in both studies, the required sample size for the modified study is approximately three times that of the original study.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) The probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase. This is because the power of the original study was 0.8, but the power of the modified study would be 1 (approaching 100% in most research contexts). The Type I error probability would stay the same because the decreases in sample size for the Type I and Type II errors are roughly equal.<|im_end|>",
