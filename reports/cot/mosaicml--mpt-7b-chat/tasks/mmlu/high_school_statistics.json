The null hypothesis, which is the hypothesis that there is no difference between two groups, must be tested against an alternative hypothesis, which is the hypothesis that there is a difference between the two groups.\n\nIn order to conduct a hypothesis test, we must first establish some important assumptions, such as the assumption of independence and normality. We then define a significance level, which is the minimum probability of making a type I error, rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This significance level is typically set at 0.05.\n\nThe power of a test refers to its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis with a certain level of probability, or statistical power. A test with a high power will have a higher chance of detecting an alternative hypothesis when it is present, relative to a test with a low power.\n\nStatement A is true and states that if there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level. This is because the probability of making a type I error is reduced as the significance level is lowered, and the type I error chance is directly proportional to the relative risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.\n\nStatement B is false, as the choice of testing method should be determined prior to the collection of data, and should be based on the hypothesized effect size, sample size, and statistical power requirements. The chosen significance level should be regarded as the minimum acceptable level of evidence required to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nStatement C is true and states that if a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis. This is because the significance level establishes the minimum probability of making a type I error, and the type I error rate is directly proportional to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.\n\nStatement D is incorrect, as the power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis with a certain level of probability. The power refers to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true, and is defined as 1 - the type II error, or the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is false.
