Based on the information provided, the best answer that describes how the file is sent to the user is (B) The file is broken into packets for transmission. The user's browser must request each packet in order until all packets are received. This is because the Web server typically sends the entire file in one or more packets, and the user's browser must request each packet to receive the file in its entirety. This process is known as \"packet-based transmission,\" and ensures that the user receives the entire file without any interruption or delay. On the other hand, options (A) and (D) would result in errors or unsuccessful transmission, while option (C) is outdated and infrequent in modern Web browsing.",

While binary code can be used to store data and instructions for a computer to execute, it cannot be used to express programming language constructs such as loops, conditionals, and functions. Additionally, programming languages have more advanced features such as garbage collection and metaprogramming that are not possible in binary code. While binary code can reduce the likelihood of errors, it also adds an additional layer of complexity to debugging and maintenance.
