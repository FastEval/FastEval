Then, by the problem statement, we know that the length of the rectangle is twice its width, so 2x = 5. This means that x = 2.5.\n\nWe also know that the length of the diagonal is $5\\sqrt{5}$. To find the length of one side of the rectangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of one side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. More specifically, in this case, we want the length of one side, so we can square the diagonal length and divide by 2 (since there are two sides):\n$5\\sqrt{5}\\cdot5\\sqrt{5}/2 = 125$\nTherefore, the length of one side of the rectangle is $5\\sqrt{5}$ cm.\n\nFinally, we can use Heron's formula to find the area:\n$s = 5\\sqrt{5}$, $\\ triangles = 2$, $s_1 = 2$, $s_2 = 5\\sqrt{5}$\n$\\area = \\sqrt{3/2}s_1\\cdot(s_2)^2 - \\sqrt{3/2}s_2\\cdot(s_1)^2$\n$\\area = \\sqrt{3/2}(2)(5\\sqrt{5})(5\\sqrt{5}) - \\sqrt{3/2}(5\\sqrt{5})(2)^2$\n$\\area = 125\\cdot25 - 25\\cdot25$\n$\\area = 500 - 25$\n$\\area = 465$\nTherefore, the answer is (D) $465\\text{(square meters)}$.<|im_end|>",

            "model_answer": ": \nThank you for the question. Let's start by considering the given information about the graph of $f(x)$. The function $f(x)$ must be a monomial, since all polynomials have at most one point where their graph intersects the x-axis. Additionally, $f(1)$ must be equal to $5$ since this is the value that $f(-2)$ and $f(2)$ equal. Since the graph of $f(x)$ must include both $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$, we know that $f(1)$ must fall between these two values. However, we also know that $f(1)$ must be a real number and we have not been given any constraints on its specific value. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact value of $f(1)$ at this time. However, we can determine the range of possible values for $f(1)$ by considering the domain and codomain of $f(x)$. The domain of $f(x)$ is $(-2,-1)\\cup(1,2)$ and the codomain is $\\mathbb{R}$. This means that the possible values of $f(1)$ are any real number that falls between $(-2,1)$ and $(1,2)$, which is $(-inf,-2)\\cup(1,2)=(-inf,-1)\\cup(2,inf)$. Therefore, the range of possible values for $f(1)$ is $(-inf,-2)\\cup(1,2)$, or $(-inf,-1)\\cup(2,inf)$. The answer is (C) (-inf, 1) or (C) (-inf, 2).<|im_end|>",

            "model_answer": ": Certainly. It would be helpful to know the exact number of pins in each pile that John originally had, so that we can obtain the degree of accuracy that we need in order to solve this problem. Let's assume that there are 180 pins in total and that John divided them into two equal piles. Then, if he gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile, he would have given him 60 pins. Also, since he had 66 pins left, the remaining pins must be in one of the two piles that he kept. Let's assume that he kept pile A, which contained 144 pins. Then, his share of pile B, which contained the other 144 pins, would've been 96 pins. Let's now solve for the missing information. Since John gave his brother 60 of the pins in pile A, then he had 60 x 96 = 6% of the total amount of pins that he had, which is (180 x 3 x 2)/4 = 72% of the original 144. So the number of pins that John originally had is (144 x 3 x 2)/4 - 72 = 36 A. Therefore, the answer is (E) 36.<|im_end|>",

In order to solve it, we need to factor 1200, which can be done with the help of the greatest common factor (GCF) and the difference of squares (DS) formulas. Applying the DS formula, we know that $n^2$ must be less than or equal to the difference between 1200 and its divisors, which are 2 and 3. This simplifies to $n^2 \\leq 1200-2-3=405$, which factors as 3x2x31. Using the GCF formula, we notice that the two factors of 3 must divide 1800 - n^2, while the two factors of 2 must divide n^2. Simplifying further, we get 2^2n + 1800 - 3^2n = 1, so n = 1. Therefore, the sum of all positive integer values of n is 1, and the answer is (A).<|im_end|>",
