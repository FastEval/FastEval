The length of the diagonal of a square is equal to the length of its diameter. Since we don't know the length of the diagonal of the square, we cannot use it to find the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. Therefore, we can assume that the diagonal of the square divides the diagonal of the rectangle into two equal parts. This means that the diagonal of the rectangle is the square root of twice the length of the diagonal of the square, which is $5\\sqrt{5}$. Now, let's use Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal of the square and the area of the rectangle. \n$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the diagonals of the square and rectangle respectively, and $c$ is the length of the diagonal of both squares and rectangles.
