            "model_answer": "Thank you for the question. In order to find the degree of the field extension illustrated in the question, we need first to find the minimal polynomial of any elements of the extension. As both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are in the field extension, the minimal polynomial for these elements is 10x^2 - 7x + 1 = 10x^2 - 13x + 1, as shown by Vieta's formulas. Similarly, the minimal polynomial for sqrt(18) is 15x^2 - 2x + 1. We can find the common factors of these two polynomials by dividing the first polynomial by the second polynomial, resulting in a polynomial of degree 8. This means that the degree of the field extension is at most 8, which corresponds to answer (B) of 4. However, since the polynomial must have integer coefficients, the degree must be exactly 4. Therefore, the answer is indeed (B) 4.<|im_end|>",

We also need to account for the fact that every element in S_5 must appear in exactly one term, so we can't just have 1x2 or 2x1.

In other words, if G is a non-Abelian group and H is a factor group of G (i.e. H is the set of all finite intersections of G-cosets), then H is also non-Abelian. \nNow, let us consider Statement 2.

A factor group is a group that can be obtained by taking the kernel of a homomorphism from G to the group of integers. A homomorphism is a function that preserves the group operation, in other words: a, b | c = a \u00b7 b | c for all a, b, c in G.\nThe kernel of a homomorphism is the set of all elements of G that map to the identity in the target group (i.e. the group of integers in this case). Specifically, if f(x) = x^2, then the kernel of f is {1}.\nIsomorphic means that two groups have the same set of elements, and the same set of group operations. We can consider this in the context of homomorphic images in this way: if G is isomorphic to H, then the homomorphic images of G are also isomorphic to H.\nTherefore, statement 1 tells us that every homomorphic image of G can be obtained by taking the kernel of a homomorphism from G to the group of integers. Since every homomorphism has a kernel, we can obtain the homomorphic images of G by taking the factor groups of G. This means that we can use the factor groups of G to describe the homomorphic images of G.\nWe can use statement 2 to confirm this explanation. Here, the \"up to isomorphism\" means that two groups are considered the same if they have the same set of elements and the same set of group operations. Since the homomorphic images of G are morphisms from G to the group of integers, and morphisms preserve the group structure, the homomorphic images of G also have the same set of elements and the same set of group operations as the factor groups of G.

One way to show this equivalence is to prove that if the kernel of a homomorphism is trivial, then it must contain the identity element of the ring, since any element multiplied by the identity element must be equal to the identity element itself. Conversely, if the homomorphism is one-to-one, then the kernel must be {0}, since the homomorphism maps the identity element to another element of the ring when the homomorphism is applied to an element of the ring, which would imply that the two elements are equal.\nTherefore, the answer to the question must be (A), True, True.<|im_end|>",
