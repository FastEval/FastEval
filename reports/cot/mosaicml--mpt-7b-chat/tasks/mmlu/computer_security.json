            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": I would say the answer is (D) Mutation-based. \nMutation-based fuzzers generate new strings by applying mutations to an existing input. This can include random changes to characters, inserting or removing characters, swapping characters, or changing the order of characters. Since mutation-based fuzzers generate new inputs for every mutation, they are more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the program. In contrast, generational fuzzers recreate the entire input from scratch each time, whereas blackbox fuzzers have limited control over the input space, and whitebox fuzzers have full knowledge of the target's behavior, making them less suited for exploring the entire input space.",

            "question": "Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don\u2019t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.\n2. An attacker impersonating the server.\n\n(A) True, True\n(B) False, False\n(C) True, False\n(D) False, True",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": To answer this question, we need to understand what the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is and how it works. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret key without requiring the parties to trust each other beforehand. It does this by exploiting the difficulty of solving certain mathematical problems, specifically the discrete logarithm problem.\nThe protocol works as follows: \n1. The server chooses a random number R (called the base) and sends it to the client.\n2. The client generates a random number S (called the supplement) and calculates S^R (mod p), where p is a large prime number (called the base).\n3. The client sends the calculated value (S^R) to the server.\n4. The server calculates (S^R) mod p and sends it back to the client.\n5. The client calculates (S^R) mod p and shares the resulting value with the server.\n6. Both the client and server have now established a shared secret key, which they can use to encrypt and decrypt messages.\nNow, let's apply this protocol to the given scenario: since the client did not provide a client certificate, it cannot be authenticated, so the server cannot use public key cryptography to authenticate the client. To establish a secure connection, the server must use a combination of public key and secret key cryptography. Specifically, the server must generate a public key, use it to authenticate the client, and then use the Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish a shared secret key between the client and server.\nTherefore, this scenario meets the condition for attack (1), as an attacker who is able to replay bytes can impersonate the client and convince the server that it is the legitimate client. Therefore, the answer is (A) True, True.",

What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",

In C and C++, these predefined functions are often designed to work with a fixed-size buffer, and may not have enough space to handle larger amounts of data.\n\n(4) Other causes of buffer-overflow include not checking the size of external memory, not checking for processing power, or not checking a database for security vulnerabilities.
