            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. We can solve it using algebra. First, we need to isolate p on one side of the equation. To do that, we can rewrite the equation as 24 = 2(p + 6). Now, we can use the distributive property to simplify the left side of the equation: 24 = 2(p + 6) = 2p + 12. Now, we can use the fact that p + 6 = 8 (since we know the value of p from the problem statement). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as 2p + 12 = 24, which simplifies to 2p = 12. Therefore, the value of p in 24 = 2p is (D) p = 12.<|im_end|>",

            "model_answer": ": We can solve this problem by using algebra. Let's assume that Ms. Perez drove \"x\" miles on the first day and calculated the total number of miles she drove in 5 days as 40. That means she drove 40/5 = 8 miles per day on average. To find the corresponding value of \"x\", we can substitute the average into the equation x = 40/5 = 8. Therefore, the answer is D) 9 miles.<|im_end|>",

            "model_answer": "This question involves solving a quadratic equation, specifically, \n\nax^2 + bx + c = 0\n\nwhere a = -8, b = -1, and c = 40.\n\nTo solve for x, we need to eliminate one of the variables. One way to do this is by using the fact that a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 must have roots of the form \u00b1x, where x is the solution. In this case, we can use the fact that -8 is a factor of -40, so we have -8 x + 8 = -40, which simplifies to 2x = 28.\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables: 2x = 28 and x = \u00b18. These are linear equations, which we can solve for x by setting them equal to each other and solving for x. In this case, \n\n2x = 28\n\nx = 14\n\nFinally, we use the fact that x is the solution, and we substitute it back into the original equation to find the quotient:\n\nx^2 + (-1)x + 40 = 0\n\n14 x + 40 = 0\n\n140 - 14 x = 0\n\n140 = 14 x\n\n14 x = 140\n\nx = 10\n\nTherefore, the solution is x = 10, and the quotient is (D) 5.<|im_end|>",
