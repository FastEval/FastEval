Let\u2019s break it down step-by-step. \nFirst, we know that Ms. Perez drove the same number of miles each day, so we can eliminate answers (C) 8 and (D) 9, since those would require her to have driven different numbers of miles on different days. \nNext, we know that Ms. Perez drove a total of 40 miles in 5 days, so we can calculate what those four numbers must have been by dividing 40 by 5 and adding 1 to each of the resulting quotients. If the result is 0, then the sum of those numbers must be 1, so we can eliminate that option and assume that the sum is either 3 or 4. \nIf we assume that the sum is 3, then the total number of miles driven will be 3(1+2+3+4+5) = 27, which is impossible, since this adds up to more than 40. So let\u2019s assume that the sum is 4, then the total number of miles driven will be 4(1+2+3+4+5) = 40. \nNext, we know that Ms. Perez drove the same number of miles each day, so the sum of the totals must also be 5. If we assume that she drove the same number of miles on each individual day, then the total number of miles driven must be 40/5 = 8. \nFinally, we can eliminate options (A) 5 and (B) 7, since they would require unequal amounts of miles driven on individual days. Therefore, the only remaining answer is (C) 8, which represents the sum of the total number of miles driven on each individual day.",

That\u2019s a kind of word problem that I can solve by writing an equation and solving it.

This is the smallest value that is smaller than the denominator (the bottom number in a fraction). Since there are zeroes before the one, we count up from left to right to find the place value of zero, which is the second from the left. The place value of zero is the tens place (the leftmost column of a Numeric/Number representation). So we can write 0.06 as 0.60 (borrowing a 6 from the ones place), which we can now simplify further to 0.05, which means that the tens place value of the dividend (the number we're dividing) is 5.\n\nWe can now apply the tablespoons or crumpled note method to the dividend, since the ones place value is less than the difference between the dividend and the divisor (the number we're dividing by).

Since 0.7 is a very small number, we need to be careful not to divide by zero, because that would be undefined. To make sure we don't do that, we can check that -5.04 is not equal to 0.7. If the two numbers were equal, that would mean we could divide by zero, which is obviously wrong. In this case, we can see that -5.04 is not equal to 0.7, so we can be confident that we can proceed with the division.\n\n2. Next, we can perform the division with a calculator, and see that the answer is approximately 0.72. This is the quotient of 5.04 divided by 0.7, which is equal to 7.2 with 2 decimal places.\n\n3.
