            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": The correct answer is (C) 10 permanent members with veto power, and 5 rotating members without veto power. This is because the Security Council consists of 15 members total, including 5 permanent members with veto power (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and 10 non-permanent members that serve for two-year terms. These rotating members do not have veto power, so they must vote in accordance with the majority of the Security Council.",

            "model_answer": ":\n(C) It enhanced Congressional control over the Vietnam War. \nThe Gulf of Tonkin resolution was passed by the US Congress in 1964 in response to the escalating conflict in Vietnam. It authorized the use of force in Southeast Asia and granted the president broad powers in response to the reported aggression of North Vietnam against the US. While the resolution was initially seen as a significant step in US foreign policy, its true importance lay in the enhanced legislative oversight and control that it provided over the Vietnam War. Specifically, the resolution allowed Congress to more effectively exert its constitutional authority to declare war and authorize military action, as well as to scrutinize and criticize the actions of the executive branch.",

            "model_answer": ": Great question! \nLet\u2019s start by taking a look at each of the options and considering which one does not fit the description of a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States. \nOption (A) terrorists is not a nonstate actor, because while they are definitely a threat, they are usually motivated by political or ideological grievances rather than commercial or financial gain, which is the typical motivation for nonstate actors like organized crime or drug traffickers. \nOption (B) organized crime is a nonstate actor, and they do pose a threat to the United States, but they are often more interested in financial or political gain than in hurting American citizens directly. \nOption (C) drug traffickers are also nonstate actors, but they do pose a direct threat to American citizens by distributing illegal substances. \nThat leaves us with (D) China, who is not only a nonstate actor, but also a key global economic and political power, whose actions and decisions can have significant impacts on the United States. So to answer the question, we can say that (D) China is not a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States.",

Firstly, he believed that internal reform rather than international negotiation was the key to economic regeneration of the US. Secondly, he feared that an aggressive foreign policy would divert attention and resources away from the domestic problems facing the country. Finally, he always favoured isolationism and believed that the United States should stay out of foreign conflicts.

Many countries began buying war supplies from the United States as a result of the war, which led to a growing US economy. Additionally, Europe was heavily in debt after the war, and many countries had to pay off loans from the United States. This forced Europe to rely on the US economically, which helped to shift economic power away from Europe and towards the United States.  Furthermore, the war led to an increase in immigration from Europe to the United States, which also contributed to US economic growth. \n\nAnswer: (D)",

As such, the answer is (D) Congress. The United States Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war and regulate the military. This power is shared among the House of Representatives and the Senate, which must vote together on any war declaration. In practice, the commander-in-chief (the president) can propose a declaration of war or a specific military engagement, but ultimately Congress must approve or disapprove of the action. The United States has never used military force without congressional approval, though there have been cases where Congress has delegated some of its war powers to the president, such as the authority to commit the United States to war in Afghanistan following the September 11 terrorist attacks.",
