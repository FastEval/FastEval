            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we must look to the current state of medical knowledge in the year 2020. At that time, it was generally accepted that the most appropriate size for a cannula in a patient who needed a rapid blood transfusion would be either a 18 gauge or 20 gauge cannula. A 22 gauge cannula would be larger than the average artery, which is typically around 18-20 gauge, and a 24 gauge cannula would be too small to effectively deliver blood. Therefore, the answer is (B) 20 gauge. (Note: Blood transfusions are now given using improved technology and techniques that have evolved since 2020, and may require different cannula sizes or approaches.

            "model_answer": "Thank you for asking me this question! To answer, successful marathon running requires all of these attributes, but they are not equally important. Strength and stamina are essential for maintaining a consistent pace throughout the running journey, and for preventing injury. Power is important for being able to accelerate and maneuver around obstacles on the course. Stride length is important for increasing your overall speed and efficiency, and can be improved through training. However, all of these attributes are most easily improved through a combination of good nutrition, regular cardio exercise, and consistent training over time. Therefore, each of these attributes is important, but all of them together are what makes for a successful marathon.<|im_end|>",

Scientists have not yet identified the specific causes of Lewy Body Dementia, but they believe it could be linked to inflammation in the brain and/or oxidative stress. Lewy Body Dementia is the second most common cause of dementia in the UK, after Alzheimer's. Therefore, my estimated answer is (B) Cerebrovascular (stroke) disease.<|im_end|>",

In the other situations listed, (A) the patient has a semi-formed or liquid output, (B) the patient has a colostomy, and (C) in the immediate post-operative period, open pouches are typically used as they are more easily emptied and less likely to cause leakage.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "When we have an increasing number of sprints, the body muscles begin to experience fatigue. This is because a sprint requires a high level of energy and involves a certain amount of muscle activity. As we continue exercising in sprints, the body eventually runs out of energy store called ATP. This causes the body to switch from using ATP to using energy stored in mitochondria called ADP and ATP. This process is called anaerobic respiration, and it produces less ATP per unit of oxygen consumed than aerobic respiration. The body can only perform anaerobic respiration for a short period of time before fatique sets in. \nTherefore, the answer is (D) relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases. This means that the body can continue to perform sprints for a longer period of time as the anaerobic contribution decreases and the aerobic contribution increases due to the availability of more ATP in the body.<|im_end|>",

There are many possible causes for diplopia, but it can occur if one eye is covered, causing an imbalance in the visual input to the brain. This is known as monocular diplopia. On the other hand, binocular diplopia occurs when both eyes are functioning normally, but there is a problem with clasping or teaming of the eyes, which means that the eyes are not able to hold focus on an object together. This can cause a lack of steady vision and blurred vision.<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Thank you for your question. Sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda, is a compound that is dissolved in water and neutralizes acid. When ingested, it can have a variety of effects on the human body, one of which is to improve middle distance running performance by elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid. In other words, when an athlete ingests sodium bicarbonate, it can reduce the amount of hydrogen ions (H + ) in the extracellular fluid, which is a byproduct of metabolic processes that occurs when an athlete is exercising. This reduction in hydrogen ions can help the athlete perform better by reducing acidosis, which is a condition where there is a buildup of hydrogen ions in the blood and muscle tissue. While there are other factors that can contribute to improved performance, such as training and nutrition, a properly timed sodium bicarbonate ingestion can have a beneficial effect on an athlete's ability to perform at a high level during exercise.<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure! Which option do you think is correct? Let's start by looking at the question. The sentence is short and straightforward, so we know that the answer must be something that could bind to fatty acids, which are molecules that have two tail-ends, like a key and a lock. The question doesn't specify which end of the fatty acid, though, so we have to make a few more assumptions based on the information given.\nFor example, we know that (A) thiokinase, (B) coenzyme A (CoA), and (C) acetyl-CoA, are molecules that can bind to the \"other end\" of fatty acids. But we also know that (D) carnitine is transported into the mitochondria in an energetically inefficient manner, which means that it is likely not the correct answer. We can eliminate (D) because of this.\nThe remaining options are (A) thiokinase and (B) coenzyme A (CoA), which are both molecules that can bind to the acetyl end of fatty acids. We also know that fatty acids have two tails, so it's reasonable to assume that one tail binds to thiokinase, and the other tail binds to coenzyme A (CoA). This fits with the idea of fatty acids being transported into the mitochondria, since the mitochondria are the organelles that process fatty acids for energy.\nTherefore, I believe the answer is (A) thiokinase, since it is the molecule that can bind to the acetyl end of the fatty acid.<|im_end|>",
