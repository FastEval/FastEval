            "model_answer": ": Great question! When inserting a cannula for a blood transfusion, it's important to choose the correct size to avoid complications such as bleeding or arterial damage. As of 2020 medical knowledge, the recommended size of cannula to use in a patient who needs a rapid blood transfusion is (D) 24 gauge. This is because a larger diameter cannula is necessary to provide adequate blood flow, while avoiding any damage to the patient's arteries. Thank you for asking!",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. In my opinion, the key attribute in successful marathon running is (D) stamina. This is because marathon running is a grind, and requires a high level of endurance and the ability to sustain a high level of effort over a prolonged period of time. While strength and power are important for running at a faster pace and covering more ground, they are not as critical for success in a marathon, where the focus is on endurance and the ability to keep going even when it is tough. Stride length is also important, but it is closely related to stride frequency, and a longer stride length combined with a higher stride frequency is generally more effective for running long distances. Therefore, I believe that (D) stamina is the most important attribute in successful marathon running.",

Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK, with an estimated 64% of all cases of dementia being caused by this disease. Stroke is the second most common cause, accounting for approximately 19% of cases. Lewy body dementia and HIV infection account for a much smaller percentage of cases, respectively. Lewy body dementia is the second most common form of dementia in the UK, affecting around 7% of cases, while HIV infection is extremely rare as a cause of dementia. I hope this explanation is helpful. The answer is A (Alzheimer's disease).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question! Here are the step-by-step reasoning for each answer option:\nA) Elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allows a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle. In other words, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) ingestion increases the alkalinity or buffering capacity of the blood, which promotes faster expulsion of acid (H+) ions from the muscle tissue, thereby improving exercise endurance and performance. This is known as the \"HCO3- acid-base hypothesis.\"\nB) Reducing the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allows a faster influx of hydrogen ions into muscle. This answer option is actually incorrect, as elevation of the pH and buffering capacity, as in A), promotes faster efflux of hydrogen ions and reduces acidity in the muscle tissue, not an influx of hydrogen ions.\nC) Elevating the pre-exercise muscle pH is irrelevant to enhancing exercise performance, as the pH of the muscle tissue should be preserved during exercise to minimize harm to the muscle cells.\nD) Elevating the pre-exercise muscle pH is not related to exercise performance, as this has more to do with systemic acid-base balance and may be a risk factor for developing exercise-induced asthma.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A), as sodium bicarbonate ingestion alkalizes the blood and promotes faster acid ejection from the muscle tissue, thereby enhancing exercise endurance and performance.",

Codons are composed of triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA, which are used to encode amino acids in polypeptide chains. While it is true that codon reading frames can sometimes result in quadruplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA (in cases where there are multiple possible reading frames, or when there is alternative splicing of mRNA), these are ultimately considered to be improper. Additionally, while deoxyribose sugars can form part of DNA, they are not considered to be components of codons.
