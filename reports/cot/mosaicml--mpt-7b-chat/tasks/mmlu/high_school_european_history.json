It observes that religious practices in ancient Rome were considered equally true, false, and useful by different groups of people - the common people, philosophers, and even magistrates, who were in positions of power. This tells us that religious practices were not a cornerstone of social cohesion in ancient Rome, and that people had differing beliefs and practices. This also explains why we see different religious groups coexisting in ancient Rome, such as the polytheistic Romans, the Christians, and other minority religions.

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him.

When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.
