We know that the festival in question is a ten day New Year festival that celebrates Babylon's culture. \nNext, we can eliminate option (D) Nehebkau, because it doesn't make sense that a ten day festival would celebrate the entire culture of Babylon. \nWe can also eliminate option (B) Wag and Thoth, because we don't know anything about them specifically in relation to the festival. \nNow, let's look at option (A) Akitu. Akitu is an important Babylonian goddess who was associated with the beginning of life, creativity, and harvests.
