            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": Naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes are associated with the Yin-Yang School. The Yin-Yang School was a school of thought in ancient China that emphasized balance and moderation. It looked at natural phenomena such as the sun and the moon, and how they were constantly in balance with each other. This emphasis on balance and moderation can be seen in nature, and naturalists who followed this school of thought often focused on describing and understanding natural elements and processes. Daoism and the Mengzi were both other schools of thought in ancient China, but they didn\u2019t necessarily focus on natural elements and processes in the same way as the Yin-Yang School. Humanistic Buddhism also didn\u2019t focus on natural elements and processes in the same way as the other options. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Yin-Yang School.",

The ragas are musical compositions that are played during religious ceremonies and rituals. They are used to promote devotion, love, harmony and balance. While there is no explicit connection between the use of ragas and love, we can assume that the Sikh religion promotes love and compassion towards all beings, and thus the use of ragas may be a parallel to this sentiment.
