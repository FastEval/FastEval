            "question": "One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\n(B) admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\n(C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n(D) inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",

            "model_answer": ": \n(D) inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment. \nThe reason for this answer is that, as the question states, the boy was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. The question also states that the boy was accompanied by his father when he visited the attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. Therefore, it can be inferred that the boy was seeking legal advice regarding the possible lawsuit that he and his father may pursue against the pilot. As per the attorney-client privilege, any confidential communication between the attorney and the client is protected and cannot be disclosed in court. However, the attorney-client privilege is not absolute and waivable in certain situations, such as when the client or a third party seeks to use the information for some unlawful purpose or when the client expressly waives the privilege. In this case, the filing of the lawsuit by the father waives the attorney-client privilege, and the testimony of the consulting attorney regarding the boy's physical condition during the consultation is admissible in court since it is relevant to the issue of negligence on the part of the pilot.",

            "question": "A state statute provides: \"Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. \" Violation of the statute is made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found\n\n(A) not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(B) not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(C) guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n(D) guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.",

The police officer's use of force was unlawful and disproportionate. There was no probable cause for the arrest, and the prosecution failed to prove that the suspect was involved in the robbery. The suspect's account of events is more credible and should be accepted by the jury.",

            "question": "A taxpayer was notified by the government that her individual income tax was underpaid by $1,012. 69. The taxpayer retained an attorney to represent her in contesting the assessment. During the preparation of his client's case, the attorney suggested that it might be a good idea if the taxpayer hired an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement for the year in question. Following the attorney's advice, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, who prepared a financial statement, which the attorney referred to at trial. During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testif' about statements that the taxpayer made to him. The accountant's proposed testimony is\n\n(A) inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n(B) inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.\n(C) inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.\n(D) admissible as an admission.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Thank you for asking me this question. Here is my response.\n(A) The attorney-client privilege protects the confidentiality of communications between a client and their attorney. Since the accountant prepared the financial statement for the taxpayer's case, the accountant is considered the client's agent, and thus communications between the taxpayer and accountant is protected by the attorney-client privilege. Therefore, the accountant's proposed testimony is inadmissible since it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n(B) The taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination protects the taxpayer from having to testify about their finances in a court of law. Since the accountant prepared the financial statement on behalf of the taxpayer, there is no direct connection between the taxpayer and the accountant's testimony. Therefore, the accountant's proposed testimony is inadmissible as it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.\n(C) The work-product rule protects communications and materials created by an attorney in preparation for a case. Since the accountant prepared the financial statement on behalf of the taxpayer's attorney, the testimony and materials associated with the accountant's testimony are protected by the work-product rule. Therefore, the accountant's proposed testimony is inadmissible as it would violate the work-product rule.\n(D) This is not an admissible option. There was no admission made by the taxpayer to the accountant during the preparation of their case. Therefore, this is not an admissible option.\nThe answer is (A).",

A law in the state requires new political entrants (regardless of party affiliation) to obtain three times the number of signatures as other candidates who have run for office previously. The resident, however, failed to obtain the necessary number of authenticating signatures to have his name placed on the ballot. The resident filed a complaint in federal district court alleging the unconstitutionality of the authenticating requirement. Which of the following, if established, is the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticating requirement?\n\n(A) The resident's petition contained a large number of false signatures.\n(B) A similar authenticating statute was held to be constitutional in another state the previous year.\n(C) The authenticating requirement was necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n(D) Two other candidates had successfully petitioned to have their names included on the ballot.",

            "model_answer": ": \nThe state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticating requirement is option D, that two other candidates had successfully petitioned to have their names included on the ballot. This suggests that the authenticating requirement may be a valid and necessary part of the electoral process, and that the resident's failure to obtain sufficient signatures was not due to exceptional circumstances that would warrant overturning the requirement. Additionally, the fact that the state has a law requiring new political entrants to obtain a certain number of signatures as opposed to simply paying a fee, indicates that the state has a legitimate interest in preventing fraudulent elections and encouraging citizen participation.",

            "question": "A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order\n\n(A) valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\n(B) valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\n(C) invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\n(D) invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.",
