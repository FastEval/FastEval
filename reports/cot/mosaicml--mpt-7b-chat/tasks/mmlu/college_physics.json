            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question! The quantum efficiency of a photon detector is a measure of the fraction of incident photons that are detected by the detector. Since the detector detects photons one after the other, we can assume that the detector is not saturated or overwhelmed with too many photons at once. Therefore, the total number of photons that can be detected is the number of individual photons, which is 100 photons in total. \nStep 1: Let's assume that the detector has an average quantum efficiency of 0.1. This means that the detector will detect, on average, 10% of the photons that hit the detector. In other words, the detector will detect 1 photon out of 10. Therefore, the detector will detect 100 photons in total.\nStep 2: Since the detector can detect only one photon at a time, it cannot detect more than one photon at once. Therefore, if we assume that the detector has an rms deviation of 0, then it will detect the maximum number of photons that it can detect in one second, which is 100 photons. Therefore, the answer is (A). \n(A)",

The energy difference between para- and ortho-states is due to the angular momentum. In the Bohr model, the electrons move in circular orbits. If the electrons move in opposite directions with equal speed, there is only one type of angular momentum, which is perpendicular to the circle. This results in a para-state. If they move in the same direction, there is also one type of angular momentum, which is again perpendicular to the circle. This results in an ortho-state.
