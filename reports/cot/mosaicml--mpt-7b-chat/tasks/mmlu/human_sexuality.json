            "model_answer": "Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Although it is treatable with antibiotics, the risk of infection with a single exposure is relatively high. Infections can occur in both men and women, but are more common in men. Gonorrhea is often asymptomatic in the early stages of infection, but if left untreated, it can cause significant health problems such as pelvic inflammations and chronic pain. However, even in cases where symptoms are present, the infection can often be misdiagnosed or overlooked, and many cases may go undiagnosed or untreated.<|im_end|>",

            "model_answer": ": (A) the id.  This question is quite complicated, but in Freudian terms the id would be considered to be the dominant force.  This is because the attraction to Jacques is based on the pleasure of sexual desire, which is a basic and primal instinct.  In contrast, taking a test and being responsible would be more elevated and rational.  However, the id often wins out over other Freudian forces, since it is the most primal and difficult to control.<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Thank you for the question!  Sociobiologists believe that there are more males than females with paraphilias because (D) male brains are generally better developed than female brains, which allows them to process and respond to novel sexual stimuli more effectively than females.  Additionally, evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who are capable of responding to a wider variety of sexual stimuli, which may have led to the development of paraphilias in males while females are less likely to develop such conditions.  Option (A) is incorrect because paraphilias do not necessarily guarantee survival of the species, and options (B) and (C) are incorrect as there is no evidence to suggest that left brain/right brain differences or brain development differences between males and females specifically impact paraphilias.   Finally, the final answer is (D) male.<|im_end|>",

According to attachment theory Joe would best be described as:\n\n(A) a secure lover\n(B) an avoidant lover\n(C) an anxious-ambivalent lover\n(D) a passionate lover",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": According to attachment theory, attachment styles can be categorized as secure, anxious, avoidant, or ambivalent. A secure lover is someone who has healthy, positive, and stable relationships. An anxious lover may have difficulty forming and maintaining relationships due to fear of rejection or abandonment. An avoidant lover may avoid intimacy and closeness, often feeling unattached and disconnected from others. An ambivalent lover may have attachment issues, often feeling torn between wanting a close and intimate relationship and a desire for independence and freedom. \nIn the given scenario, Joe's \"desperate advances\" and past history of \"disorganized attachment\" would suggest that he is more likely to be an avoidant lover. Specifically, his inability to regulate one's own emotions and behavior can lead to challenges in maintaining healthy relationships, as seen with his past experiences. \nTherefore, Joe would best be described as an avoidant lover.<|im_end|>",

            "model_answer": ": (B) Bruce likely participated in more male-typical play than Chuck as children. To arrive at this answer, we can draw upon cognitive and developmental research on gender and sexuality. Male children are typically more likely to engage in male-typical play, such as rough-and-tumble play, sports, and building with blocks, while female children are more likely to engage in female-typical play, such as cooking, dolls, and caring for animals. If we assume that Bruce was more interested in these types of activities as a child, and if we also know that homosexuality is often associated with a tendency towards more male-typical play and interests, it makes sense that Bruce would be more likely to identify as homosexual. \n(B) E<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": When examining the question of how Judaism regards sexuality, one must first consider the theological and philosophical beliefs of the religion. Judaism is based on the ancient Hebrew bible, also known as the Old Testament, which contains a range of texts related to sexuality and sexual morality. These texts contain both prohibitions against certain sexual behaviors and endorsements of certain practices, such as sexual abstinence before marriage. From a theological perspective, many Jews believe that sexuality is closely tied to the divine and that intimacy with others can bring one closer to God. As such, some may view sexuality as a gift from God and a positive aspect of human life. Others, however, may view sex as inherently evil and a flawed creation of God. Additionally, some Jews may view sexuality as a biological function, while others may view it as primarily a spiritual and emotional experience. (Jew)<|im_end|>",
