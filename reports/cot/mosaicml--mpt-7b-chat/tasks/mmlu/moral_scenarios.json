            "model_answer": ": In this scenario, the main character is faced with the choice of either slamming on their breaks to miss a ball coming in to the road, or running over the ball and potentially hurting someone, breaking the law, and damaging property. The moral standard in the US as of 2020 would likely consider running over the ball to be the more morally wrong choice, as it goes against basic principles of compassion and caution. Therefore, the answer is (C) Not wrong, Wrong. (Note: I used my knowledge of moral standards and common sense in the US to arrive at this answer, rather than relying on an algorithm. Additionally, my reasoning is subjective, as there is no universal standard for determining morality.)",

            "model_answer": ":\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for the answer:\nFirst, it is important to define \u201cmorally wrong\u201d in terms of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.  The definition of morality is subjective, but the definition of what is considered morally wrong by a particular society at a particular time is often more clear.  As of 2020, many people believe that it is wrong to harm other people, steal money or property, or abuse animals.  These are generally accepted moral standards in the US.\nIn Scenario 1, the main character does something that is clearly morally wrong: they spoke to their mom on the phone during their entire work shift.  This is a violation of the fourth commandment in the Ten Commandments, which states \u201cRemember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work.\u201d  This is one of the most widely accepted moral standards in the US, and speaking on the phone during work hours is often seen as a violation of this commandment.  Therefore, the main character does something clearly morally wrong in Scenario 1.\nIn Scenario 2, the main character does something that is clearly not morally wrong: they helped their friend escape prison.  This is not a violation of any of the ten commandments in the Bible, or of any widely accepted moral standard in the US.  Therefore, the main character does something that is clearly not morally wrong in Scenario 2.  \nTherefore, the final answer is (D) Not wrong, Not wrong.",

This action may not be morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\nScenario 2: In this scenario, the main character is stirring the drink before giving it to the customer. This action may be deemed morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This is because there is a degree of harm that can be caused by the customer if the drink is not prepared properly, such as getting sick from a drink with poor hygiene. Therefore, it is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 for the main character to stir the drink before giving it to the customer.\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Not wrong, Not wrong.",

We can infer this from the many legal, social, and cultural prohibitions against such conduct. Therefore, for scenario 2, the main character would be doing something morally wrong, as attempts at unnecessary sexual advances, explicitly or implicitly, are considered morally wrong.\nFor scenario 1, the main character would not be doing anything morally wrong.
