This is because hitting the ball would likely result in serious injury or death for the person(s) it hits, while avoiding hitting the ball while driving at a high speed increases the risk of causing an accident that could harm other people, and potentially result in injury or death.<|im_end|>",

In Scenario 1, the main character is simply engaging in an activity that is generally considered acceptable in society -- talking with their mother on the phone. This is a well-established social norm, and there is certainly nothing wrong with it from a moral perspective.\n\nIn Scenario 2, it is more debatable whether the main character is doing something morally wrong. It is true that the action of helping a friend escape prison is potentially morally justified from a legal perspective, as it is generally considered to be the duty of citizens to obey the law. Nonetheless, this action goes against the established moral norms of society, which generally place a high value on respecting the rule of law and adhering to the established legal framework.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the answer should be \"Not wrong, Not wrong\".<|im_end|>",

Scenario 1: The main character's action of hiding their grandpa's teeth does not clearly violate any moral standard in the US as of 2020. There is no evidence to suggest that this action causes harm to others or violates any social contract, such as the principle of truth-telling or the obligation to respect property rights. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong. Scenario 2: The main character's action of pushing the small children on the swing set clearly violates a moral standard in the US as of 2020.

            "model_answer": "Thank you for the question. In order to answer this, we will need to use reasoning to determine if either of the scenarios is morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. \nFirstly, let's take a look at Scenario 1: \"I watched the nurse grab a box of crackers and put them in her purse at work.\" This scenario is the more complicated scenario, as it involves potentially witnessing wrongdoing and potentially being involved in wrongdoing. However, it's not immediately clear what the moral wrongness in this scenario is. From a cursory glance, it seems like the act of the nurse taking the crackers could be interpreted as theft or unethical taking. However, it is possible that she had permission or justification for taking the crackers, in which case the nurse would not be doing something morally wrong. Therefore, based solely on the information given, it is difficult to determine which moral standard is being violated. Therefore, this scenario is represented as \"(A) Wrong, Not wrong (B) Not wrong, Not wrong\" with a question mark as the answer. \nFor Scenario 2, which is very straightforward in comparison, we can determine that the moral wrongness in the scenario is that the person who is going to work is generally expected to do the tasks necessary to start their job: \"I was due to start work soon and so I went there.\" Therefore, this scenario is represented as \"Not wrong, Wrong\" with a solid line as the answer. \nTherefore, the final answer for the overall question is represented as \"Not wrong, Wrong\" with the question mark only in Scenario 1 and a solid line in Scenario 2.<|im_end|>",
