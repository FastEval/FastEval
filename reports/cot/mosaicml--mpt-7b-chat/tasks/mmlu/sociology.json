            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. During the 1970s, a growing trend of increasing cannabis use in various sections of youth was observed. Cannabis use is often associated with recreational activities, which can lead to a sense of enjoyment. However, it is also essential to consider other factors that can affect the decision to use cannabis, such as social influences and peer pressure. As a result, it is likely that the increasing use of cannabis in youth during the 1970s was influenced by a combination of factors, including its perceived fun and the influence of peers and social groups. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) not as enjoyable as other sociologists had suggested.<|im_end|>",

During the nineteenth century, middle-class individuals in Western societies became increasingly involved in a variety of activities and groups, often leading to the development of a sense of middle-class identity. This is reflected in (A) the increasing involvement of middle-class individuals in civic bodies and voluntary associations, (B) the development of middle-class charity and philanthropy, and (C) the rise of professional and managerial occupations among the middle class. While these individuals may have had different interests and levels of involvement, their common middle-class status and shared social context formed a strong sense of middle-class identity.<|im_end|>",

The question asks for the answer to the statement \"Technological forms of surveillance have made it easier to...\" The answer choices (A), (B), (C), and (D) present different perspectives on how surveillance technology has been used in recent years. \nChoice (A) suggests that surveillance technology has made it easier to access and exchange private information about consumers. This could refer to the use of incentives or punishments to encourage or discourage certain behaviors, such as participation in surveys or purchases. It could also refer to changes in social norms that have made it more acceptable to share personal information online, such as to third-party companies.\nChoice (B) suggests that surveillance technology has been used to reduce prison overcrowding by the use of electronic tagging. This refers to the use of GPS monitoring or other forms of tracking that allow authorities to monitor the movements and activities of individuals who are on parole or otherwise monitored as part of a criminal justice program.\nChoice (C) suggests that surveillance technology has been used to monitor employees' activities at work. This could refer to the use of cameras or other forms of recording technology in workplaces, either to prevent or detect theft or other forms of misconduct. It could also refer to the use of monitoring software to track employee productivity or monitor for positive behaviors, such as compliance with safety regulations.\nChoice (D) is a more expansive response, suggesting that surveillance technology has made it easier to access and exchange all forms of private information about consumers, employees, and other individuals. It could refer to any use of technology that allows individuals to monitor one another or to be monitored by others, such as wearable devices that track physical activity or location-based tracking apps.\nTherefore, my answer is (D) all of the above.<|im_end|>",

            "model_answer": "(A) Organic solidarity is a social bonding that occurs in small groups of people who share a common identity based on social values, norms, and beliefs. This type of solidarity is characterized by a sense of interdependence and mutual support, which helps members to feel connected and valued. On the other hand, (B) Mechanical solidarity is a type of bonding that occurs in larger groups where individuals feel obligated to support each other in order to maintain the group's order and stability. This type of solidarity is based on the idea that if everyone does their part, the group will function smoothly. \n(C) Gesellschaft, also known as social solidarity, is a type of relational characteristic that emphasizes the importance of group membership and shared identity. In this type of solidarity, individuals feel connected to each other and share a common vision and purpose.\n(D) Anomie refers to a state of social disintegration or decay, where the norms and values of a society are lacking or missing. In this state, individuals feel disconnected from others and have a sense of disillusionment, which can lead to social unrest and turmoil.<|im_end|>",

Therefore, the first step in establishing a deviant career is for the behavior to become normalized and seen as acceptable or even desirable by some members of society. Normalization can occur through various means, such as social approval or changing societal norms and attitudes towards the particular deviant behavior. While recognition and temporary aberration are also factors that contribute to normalization, they are not the defining characteristics of this process.<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": Great question! Marxist feminists explain patriarchy in term (B) - through the concept of sex classes. Sex classes refer to the ways in which men and women are treated as distinct social classes based on gender, and the ways in which men dominate women both economically and politically. Marxist feminists believe that patriarchy is a social system that is maintained through male domination over women and exploitation of women's domestic labor. Marxists also argue that capitalist economics also contribute to this system, as female labor is often undervalued and underpaid due to gender stereotypes and the need for cheap labor. I hope this explanation was helpful! The answer is (B) sex classes.<|im_end|>",
