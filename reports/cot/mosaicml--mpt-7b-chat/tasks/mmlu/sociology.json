            "model_answer": ": In 1969, Becker published a book titled \"The Notion of Deviance: A Study in Sociological Concepts,\" in which he explored the concept of deviance, and how society creates certain behaviors as deviant or not. In this particular question, the statement that \"Becker proclaimed that cannabis use was increasing throughout all sections of youth in the 1970s\" seems to be related to deviance theory, as it refers to a behavior that was becoming more widespread and accepted in society.\n\nOne potential answer that fits this statement is letter (B), as the statement suggests that positive social reinforcement through peer acceptance and other mechanisms may have played a role in the increasing use of cannabis among youth in the 1970s. It is possible that deviant behaviors that were once stigmatized can become more accepted over time due to changes in social norms and expectations. However, it is also possible that the answer is something else, such as (A) or (C), depending on the exact context and meaning of the statement.",

            "question": "There was a growth in income inequality in the 1980s because:\n\n(A) rates of income tax increased equally for all occupational groups\n(B) there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them\n(C) the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings\n(D) growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ":\nThank you for the question. While all of the given options could potentially be contributing factors to the growth in income inequality in the 1980s, I believe the most likely explanation is that (C) the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings.\nNow, to explain my reasoning. Income inequality can be measured by the Gini coefficient, which is a commonly used measure of economic inequality. The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 (complete equality) to 1 (complete inequality), with 0 indicating perfect equality and 1 indicating perfect inequality. The higher the Gini coefficient, the greater the level of income inequality.\nDuring the 1980s, the Gini coefficient for the United States was rising, indicating a growing level of income inequality. This was a time when the overall economy was experiencing significant growth, with the unemployment rate falling to a historic low of 4.4% in 1996. However, this growth was not distributed equally across all groups in society.\nThe majority of this growth in income inequality can be attributed to rising levels of debt, as well as a growing divide between the rich and poor. This trend was accelerated by rising asset prices, including housing and stocks, which benefited the wealthy but did not trickle down to the middle and lower classes.\nIn addition, the growing divide between the rich and poor was also reflected in rising levels of income inequality in terms of occupational groups. While the growth in income inequality can be partially attributed to new occupational opportunities arising from technological change, this did not account for the growing gap between those who held professional and managerial positions and those in low-skill and service sector jobs.\nTo sum up, the answer is (C), which means that growing price inflation in consumer goods led to a rising Gini coefficient and increasing income inequality during the 1980s.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ":\nThis question requires some interpretation and analysis of the given options. Recognizing deviance as breaking important norms refers to the social process of defining and enforcing rules that shape the acceptable behavior within a society. If such rules are broken by an individual, it is considered deviant and is often frowned upon or even punished. Therefore, recognizing deviance refers to the social process of defining norms and enforcing rules, rather than an individual attribute like genetics or anatomy. The answer is (D), attributed to the person's genetic or anatomical make up.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": \nThe answer is D) managers were becoming dissatisfied with their working conditions and planned to overthrow the owners of businesses. The reason behind this answer is that the managerial revolution was characterized by the increasing power and influence of managers in organizations. However, while there were many benefits to this trend, there were also some negative consequences. One of these negative consequences was that managers were becoming increasingly dissatisfied with their working conditions, which included long working hours, low pay, and little career advancement opportunity. This dissatisfaction led to a growing movement among managers to take control of their working conditions and undermine the power of owners and shareholders in organizations. Therefore, the answer that best describes the views of John Scott (1997) in the debate about the 'managerial revolution' is (D) managers were becoming dissatisfied with their working conditions and planned to overthrow the owners of businesses.",

Marxist feminists explain patriarchy in terms of (B) sex classes, through which men oppress women economically, politically and sexually. \nThis means that patriarchy is not just about unequal rights and opportunities for men and women, but also about how men systematically exploit women in all aspects of society. This includes women's domestic labor being exploited by the capitalist economy, as well as women being denied political power and economic opportunities. \nThis interpretation of patriarchy is consistent with Marxist analysis in general, which sees capitalism as a system that benefits the majority of people in terms of economic opportunities, while simultaneously oppressing and exploiting a minority of people, in this case, women. Therefore, Marxist feminists see patriarchy as a system of oppression that is deeply entrenched in capitalist society, and is made possible by the division of labor between men and women, and the implicit value placed on women's domestic labor.",
