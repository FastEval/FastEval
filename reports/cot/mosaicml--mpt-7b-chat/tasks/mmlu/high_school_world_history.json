            "model_answer": ": The Bandung Conference was an international conference held in 1955 which sought to promote Asian solidarity and cooperation in the face of increasing US hegemony and colonialism. The conference was attended by over 40 countries, including many newly-independent Asian and African nations, and was notable for its promotion of the \"Declaration of the United Nations,\" which declared the \"equal and inalienable rights of all peoples\" and rejected \"aggressions and use of force\" in international relations. While the passage above does not specifically address the issues of regional or global politics, it does reflect a clarion call for pan-Asian unity and solidarity in the face of global power dynamics which threatened the independence and sovereignty of Asian nations. Additionally, the focus on mobilizing \"spiritual, moral, and political strength\" aligns with the key themes of the Bandung Conference and the formation of the non-aligned movement, which sought to promote collective solidarity and cooperation among developing nations in the face of US-dominated global politics. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology.",

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",
