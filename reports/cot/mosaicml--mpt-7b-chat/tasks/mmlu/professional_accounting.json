On July 1 year 7 Dean Co. issued at a premium bonds with a due date of July 1 year 12, using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the premium. The premium is a total of fixed amounts plus interest credited to a bond in excess of the amount of principal paid. This interest is otherwise known as the premium. A premium consisting of fixed amounts plus interest is called a 'discount premium'.]\n[ Due date is important because it marks the termination date of the premium and the beginning of the amortization of the bond\u2019s face value. If the premium was not properly amortized over the years after its issuance, the return of the bond\u2019s face value could be accelerated.]\nAccording to the financial accounting standards board\u2019s statement No. 5, the premium\u2019s carrying value at the end of an entity\u2019s fiscal year should reflect the premium\u2019s periodic interest cost and capitalized premium, if any. This results in a loss or gain, which is reflected in the carrying value of the bond.\nTherefore, the loss or gain from the carrying value of the bond at the end of the year is the difference between its carrying value at the end of the year and its carrying value at the beginning of the year. There is no need to determine the premium\u2019s carrying value at the end of the year.\nThe question does not specify the bond\u2019s price, so it is not possible to determine the bond\u2019s carrying value.

            "question": "What is the price of a three-year bond (face value $100), paying 5% coupons, with a yield of 6%?\n\n(A) $100\n(B) $104.29\n(C) $96.71\n(D) $97.33",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Thank you for the question! I\u2019d be happy to work through the mathematics with you.\n\nSo, we start with the face value of the bond, which is $100. We can assume that this bond is issued at a discount to face value. That means that the bond has a yield to maturity (qualitative) of less than the coupon rate. We know the coupon rate is 5%, so that means the yield to maturity should be lower than 5%.\n\nTo solve for the yield to maturity, we can use a relationship called the Yield to Maturity Formula. Let\u2019s work through that formula together:\n\nYTM = C / (F + C)\n\nHere, YTM is the yield to maturity, C is the annual coupon payment, and F is the face value of the bond.\n\nWe know that the bond is a three-year bond, which means that it\u2019s going to be paying coupons annually for three years. So, in the first year, the coupon payment is 5% of the original face value of $100:\n\nC = 5% * $100 = $5\n\nWe can plug those values into the formula:\n\nYTM = $5 / ($100 + $5) = -5.56%\n\nThat\u2019s not possible, because the coupon rate must be positive. That means that the bond could only be paying a negative coupon rate, which would mean the bond is underwater and would have to be declared invalid.\n\nSo, we can throw out answer (D).\n\nNow, we know that the coupon rate must be less than the yield to maturity. We also know that the bond must be issued at a discount to face value. That means that the bond\u2019s price (C + F) will always be greater than its face value.\n\nTo figure out the answer, let\u2019s use the formula again:\n\nC = F / (1 + y)\n\nwhere y is the annual interest rate.\n\nWe know that the bond is paying a 5% coupon rate, so we can plug that in:\n\ny = 0.05\n\nWe also know the yield to maturity, which is the same as the yield. We can plug that in:\n\ny = 0.06\n\nNow we can plug those values into the formula:\n\nC = $100 / (1.05)\n\nC = $97.33\n\nSo the bond\u2019s face value would be $97.33. But that\u2019s not quite what we\u2019re looking for. We want to find the price of the bond, not just its face value.\n\nLet\u2019s use the Yield to Maturity Formula again:\n\nC / F = Y / (1 + Y)\n\nwhere Y is the yield.\n\nWe know that the bond is paying a 5% coupon rate, so we can plug that in:\n\n0.05 / $100 = 0.05 / (1 + 0.06)\n\n0.05 / 0.096 = 0.0055\n\nNow let\u2019s check the math for answer (A):\n\nC = $100 * (1.05)\n\nC = $104.29\n\nThat\u2019s the answer from the AA (ignoring parenthesis), but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s quite right, either. Let\u2019s try something else:\n\nC = $100 * 1.0625\n\nC = $104.29\n\nThat\u2019s the answer from the AA (with parentheses), as well.\n\nSo, does that calculation make sense? Or do you think there\u2019s a better choice for answer<|im_end|>",
