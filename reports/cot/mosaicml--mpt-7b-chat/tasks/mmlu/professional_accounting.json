If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": \nThank you for the question! I can solve this problem using basic mathematics and percentages. \nHere are the steps:\nStep 1: Calculate the total cost of the limousine including yearly maintenance and insurance. Let's assume this is $10,000.\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of days in a year, which is 365.\nStep 3: Calculate the hourly rental rate by dividing the daily rental rate of $245 by the number of hours in a day (24). This gives us $9.90 per hour.\nStep 4: Calculate the total hourly yield by multiplying the hourly rental rate by the total number of hours in a year. This gives us $390,000.80.\nStep 5: Calculate the total yearly yield by multiplying the total hourly yield by the total number of hours in a year. This gives us $1,640,000.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 0.45% (D) 183% or 47.6% (rounded to the nearest whole number).",

            "model_answer": ": \n(A) is the correct statement for a nonissuer. \nAn audit sampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population. This means that if the auditor only tests a subset of the financial statements, the results may not be the same as if the entire population was tested. This is especially important for nonissuers, as their financial statements may be more complex and contain more risks than those of issuers, and a smaller sample may not be sufficient to detect all material errors. This means that nonissuers have a higher risk of material errors in their financial statements that were not detected by the audit sample, compared to issuers with simpler financial statements. Therefore, nonissuers need to have a higher level of assurance on their financial statements, and more robust audit procedures should be used to mitigate this risk.",

            "model_answer": ": To answer this question, we need to understand the general procedures that an auditor generally performs regarding subsequent events. These events are those that occur after the date of the financial statements being audited but before the auditor issues an audit report. \n(A) Inspecting inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end is generally not considered a subsequent event because these items have already been recorded in the financial statements. This would only be considered a subsequent event if these late-arriving items were missed during the audit and needed to be adjusted.\n(B) Testing internal controls that were previously reported to management as inadequate is also generally not considered a subsequent event. This would only be considered a subsequent event if there was a change in management's assessment of the internal controls after the audit was completed. However, even in this case, the auditor may not be required to perform this testing until the next audit.\n(C) Reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end is generally considered a subsequent event because these statements were not available during the audit. However, this would only be relevant if the client provided these statements to the auditor as part of the audit.\n(D) Comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited is generally considered a subsequent event.

In this case, the project generates profits of $500 in year five and year ten. Therefore, the total amount of money received from the project over the entire investment horizon can be calculated by summing these profits:  ($500 in year five) + ($500 in year ten) = $1000. \nTo calculate the present value of these future profits, we need to discount them back to their present value using a discount rate of 10%. This means dividing the total amount of profits by the discount rate of 10% for each year: ($1000 / 0.10) + ($1000 / 0.10) = $100 + $100 = $200.\nTo calculate the NPV, we subtract the initial cost of the project (which is $500 in the first year) from the cumulative amount received from the project:  $200 + $200 - $500 = $600. \nThus, the correct answer is (D) $600.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. To answer this question, we need to know more about how premium bonds work, as well as how amortization works with interest.First, let's define some terms. A premium bond is a type of interest-bearing security that allows an investor to earn interest on the difference between the face value of the bond and the price at which it was purchased. In the context of this question, the premium bond was issued on July 1 year 7 with a due date of July 1 year 12. The straight-line method is a way of amortizing the premium over the life of the bond, while the effective interest method is a more accurate way of amortizing the premium, as it takes into account the actual interest earned during the life of the bond.Now, let's look at the question itself. At June 30 year 12, there were two amounts that were affected by Dean's error: the bond carrying amount and the retained earnings. The bond carrying amount is the amount by which the bond's face value exceeds its market value, which is the price paid for the bond. The retained earnings are the amount by which the bond's opening balance exceeds its closing balance at the end of the period, which can be either a gain or a loss.To determine the answer, we need to compare the actual carrying amount and retained earnings with the amounts that would have been calculated using the effective interest method. If the actual carrying amount and retained earnings were overstated, then the answer would be (A) Overstated. If they were understated, then the answer would be (B) Understated. If there was no effect, then the answer would be (C) Overstated/Understated depends on whether the carrying amount was overstated.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": Great question! Let\u2019s tackle it step-by-step:\n1. First, we need to determine how much money the bond is worth at the current market rate. Since the bond is a three-year bond, we can assume that its maturity date is 3 years away. \n2. Next, we can calculate the bond\u2019s price by deducting the bond\u2019s face value ($100) from its market value. The market value is the price at which someone is willing to buy the bond. \n3. To do that, we need to know the current yield and the coupons that the bond pays. Since this is a three-year bond, the current yield is the yield to maturity, which is 6%. \n4. The coupons are 5%, so we need to subtract that from the current yield to get the yield to maturity. \n5. Finally, we can calculate the bond\u2019s price by multiplying the yield to maturity by the bond\u2019s face value. \n6. Translation: \nWe need to calculate the price of the bond by using the current market interest rate and compare it to the interest rate that the bond pays. One way to do that is to calculate the yield to maturity, which is the interest the bond pays divided by the interest it receives.

According to IRS guidelines (http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses/Corporate-Stock-Methods-for-Calculating-Incorporated-Business-Income), when calculating the corporation\u2019s income, she should use the evenly distributed percentage method. \nThis means that she would allocate the corporation\u2019s $400,000 in taxable income to her share of the corporation based on her 40% ownership. Since she owns 40% of the corporation, she would receive $160,000 in taxable income (40% of $400,000). \nThe remaining $60,000 in taxable income goes to the other shareholders of the corporation. \nWhen she distributed $70,000 in dividends to the shareholders, Carson received $140,000 in non-taxable dividends. \nTherefore, if the S Corporation had distributed the same amount of dividends proportionate to the shareholder\u2019s ownership percentage, Carson would have received $140,000 in taxable income (40% of $340,000, which is the total amount of dividends received, since the other shareholders would have received the remaining 60% of the dividends). \nHowever, since the S Corporation distributed the dividends to the shareholders based on the number of shares owned, Carson received $112,000 in dividends (40% of the total of $280,000) on top of the $160,000 in taxable income. \nTherefore, she would have reported a total of $372,000 in income ($160,000 + $112,000 + $40,000 = $312,000 + 40% of ($280,000 - $112,000) = $80,000 + 40% of $100,000 = $40,000). Since the S Corporation did not distribute the dividends proportionate to the shareholders\u2019 ownership percentages, she would have reported $44,000 less in income than if the S Corporation had distributed the dividends proportionate to the shareholders\u2019 ownership percentages.
