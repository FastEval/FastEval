We can use the fact that the equation is symmetric about the x-axis, which means that the number of solutions on the left of the x-axis is equal to the number of solutions on the right of the x-axis. This allows us to restrict our attention to the interval $[0,1]$ by symmetry. \n\nThe equation is also symmetric about the y-axis, which means that the number of solutions above the x-axis is equal to the number of solutions below the x-axis. This allows us to restrict our attention to the real part of the solutions by symmetry. \n\nWe are looking for real solutions, which means that the solutions belong to the real axis. Since the solutions are complex numbers, we must have k=0 and n=1. Therefore, the answer is (A).",

We want to show that there exists x in G such that x + x + x + x = 0. We can start by considering the group of integers modulo 16, which we can represent additively. We can observe that any element of the form a + b + c + d with a, b, c, d \u2260 0 in Z/16 has the form 4k + 1 for some k \u2208 Z/4Z. In particular, for each k we have a, b, c, d \u2260 0 with (a, b, c, d) = (k + 1, k + 2, k + 3, k + 4) (mod 4).

Since it moves at a constant rate of 2 meters per second and the ladder is 9 meters long, the velocity of the bottom end is 2 meters per second.\nNext, we need to find the velocity of the top end of the ladder as it slides downward along the wall. We know that the top end slides downward at a constant rate of 2 meters per second along the wall, which causes it to lose 2 meters in height every second. Since the bottom end is 3 meters above the ground at this moment, the top end is therefore 3-2 = 1 meter above the ground. Since the height of the ladder is constant, the velocity of the top end of the ladder is simply the same as the velocity of the bottom end of the ladder, which is 2 meters per second.\nFinally, we can plug these values into the formula v = u + at, where v is the velocity of the top end of the ladder, u is the initial velocity of the bottom end, a is the acceleration of the bottom end, and t is the time elapsed since the bottom end started moving. In this case, v = 2*2 = 4 meters per second. Therefore, the answer is (A) 4.",
