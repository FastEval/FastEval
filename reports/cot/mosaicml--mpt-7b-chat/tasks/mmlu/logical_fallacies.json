            "model_answer": "Sure, I can explain that for you. \nFor a valid disjunctive syllogism, there are certain components that must be present, the major premise in particular. The major premise must include two or more alternatives, meaning that it must present multiple options or possibilities. The major premise must also classify subjects, meaning that it must differentiate between entities and identify what attributes or characteristics those entities possess. Additionally, the major premise must either affirm the antecedent (meaning that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true) or deny the consequent (meaning that if the premise is true, the conclusion must be false). This is important because disjunctive reasoning requires us to consider multiple possibilities and make a decision based on that examining. Finally, the major premise must lead to a valid conclusion, meaning that the conclusion must be logically consistent with the other components of the syllogism and not invalid.<|im_end|>",

This involves altering the literal meaning of a word in order to make the argument seem more convincing or persuasive. This is different from fallacies of substance, which involve changing the actual meaning of an idea or fact. This fallacy can be identified by carefully examining the language used in an argument, and noting instances where the author seems to have intentionally changed the meaning of a word or phrase in order to make the argument stronger.<|im_end|>",

This fallacy occurs when someone presents an argument without revealing the identity or credentials of the source, and implies that the argument is legitimate simply because it supposedly comes from a respected or knowledgeable source.

For example, the statement \"All human beings are mortal\" is a generic statement, because it applies to every human being, regardless of their age, gender, or culture.\nHowever, the statement \"Every human being is mortal\" is a faulty criteria, because it makes a blanket statement that is not universally true. There are many individuals who are not human beings, and therefore cannot be considered \"mortals\". Therefore, the statement \"Every human being is mortal\" is false, and fallacious.\nFallacy of False Criteria refers to this category of fallacies.

However, while this strategy may be employed to suppress the opposing argument, it does not actually respond to or refute the argument in a meaningful way. Therefore, I would argue that the correct answer is (D), arguing actions should be taken to avoid negative results, when those results are exaggerated, unlikely, or irrelevant.

Ignoring another person's arguments is not in itself a good argument against them, as it necessary implies that those arguments are without merit. It is possible in some cases for attacking a person's character to be a valid argument against their arguments, but this would often be considered a pretext rather than a legitimate argument in itself. Causing confusion during an argument through a lack of ability to engage in refutation is something that could potentially weaken an argument, but this alone would not be considered a strong argument against someone else's argument. Using threats of harm instead of reasoning to gain agreement is generally considered an ineffective means of argumentation.
