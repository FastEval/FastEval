As a result, more of the taller individuals are able to obtain nutrients and survive to pass along their genetic information. This is an example of\n\n(A) directional selection.\n(B) stabilizing selection.\n(C) sexual selection.\n(D) disruptive selection.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": Staring at the question carefully, I would say the answer is (A) directional selection. \nExplanation: \nLet's analyze the given scenario. The environmental change that occurs in this scenario favors individuals that are tallest. This means that taller individuals are better able to obtain nutrients and survive. Therefore, there is a natural selection pressure that favors individuals with longer necks. This is an example of directional selection because it selects for a particular trait that increases the probability of survival and reproduction. Therefore, taller individuals are more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation, and this trait becomes more common in the population over time, resulting in a greater prevalence of tall giraffes.\nIn summary, the given scenario fits well with (A) directional selection, and thus, the answer is (A) directional selection.",

            "question": "Which of the changes below following the start codon in an mRNA would most likely have the greatest deleterious effect?\n\n(A) a deletion of a single nucleotide\n(B) a deletion of a nucleotide triplet\n(C) a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the first codon position\n(D) a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the third codon position",

            "model_answer": ": \nTo answer this question, we need to consider the role of codons in mRNA. Codons are groups of three nucleotides that specify a particular amino acid or stop signal for protein synthesis. In mRNA, the first nucleotide of each codon is called the start codon, and the following two nucleotides are called the reading frame. \nOption (A) would result in a missense mutation, where the deleted nucleotide is replaced by a different nucleotide. This may not have a significant effect on the structure or function of the protein, but it could lead to a change in its biological activity. \nOption (B) would result in a frame shift, where the subsequent codons are read in the wrong reading frame, leading to a premature stop signal for protein synthesis. This would result in a non-functional protein or protein with an altered sequence. \nOption (C) would result in a missense mutation as well, but it would affect the first amino acid of the protein, instead of a subsequent one. This may also have a significant effect on the structure or function of the protein. \nOption (D) would also result in a missense mutation, but it would affect the third amino acid of the protein, after the reading frame. This may have a significant effect on the structure or function of the protein, depending on the context. \nTherefore, the change that would most likely have the greatest deleterious effect is deletion of a nucleotide triplet (option B).",

One strategy they might evolve is to become sexually mature at a smaller overall body size, because smaller individuals are more likely to evade predators and therefore increase the chances of survival for the offspring. \nIn contrast, (A) selection for drab coloration of the algae-eaters would likely be ineffective as a strategy for avoiding predation by pike-cichlids, since it would not directly affect the predator's ability to locate and capture the prey. \n(B) selection for nocturnal algae-eaters would also be ineffective, since pike-cichlids are visual predators and would still be able to locate their prey by sight even if the algae-eaters were active only at night. \n(C) selection for larger female algae-eaters, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young, would likely result in a decrease in overall population size, rather than an increase, and so would not be a viable strategy for avoiding predation.",
