            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": The consumption of meat in Wales and Scotland appears to be lower than in England, based on data from 2020. Confectionery consumption also appears to be lower in Wales and Scotland than in England. While fruit and vegetable consumption is generally higher in Wales and Scotland than in England, there is some variation between the two countries. Finally, potato consumption appears to be much higher in Wales and Scotland than in England. Therefore, the answer is (D) Potatoes.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": \n\n(B) If survival time with the disease increases.\n\nThis is because if survival time with the disease increases, it means that people are living longer with the disease, which means that they will experience more of their lives with the disease if they contract it. As a result, the prevalence of the disease in the population will increase over time as more and more people are potentially exposed to and contract the disease. This assumes that the incidence rate of the disease remains constant, which is not necessarily the case and would complicate matters further.",

            "model_answer": ": Alright, let's work through this together.\nFirst, let's look at option (A). The statement says that the flavonoid class comprises flavonoids and isoflavonoids. This statement is correct.\nNext, let's look at option (B). The statement says that the digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones in soya food products are not changed by processing. This statement is correct as well.\nNow, let's look at option (C). The statement says that \u00df-Carotene and lycopene can both act as provitamin A. While this statement is technically correct, it is important to note that \u00df-carotene and lycopene are not actually provitamin A. They are only converted to vitamin A in the body, while true provitamin A is found in animal products.\nFinally, let's look at option (D). The statement says that carotenoids and flavonoids both belong to the polyphenol class. This statement is correct.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ":\nThank you for the question! The obesity epidemic has been linked to a number of factors, including increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary lifestyle. In recent decades, the average person has been consuming more calories than they would have in previous generations, and this excess energy is often stored as fat. Additionally, people today are often more likely to sit for long periods of time, such as while watching television or sitting at a desk for work, which can lead to a reduction in physical activity. This causes a problem because exercise and a healthy diet are important for maintaining a healthy weight.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": Vitamin E is a major lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes. Vitamin E acts as an effective antioxidant by preventing the oxidation of cell membrane lipids (specifically, polyunsaturated fatty acids). Specifically, vitamin E acts as a free radical scavenger, which means that it can directly react with oxygen and other free radicals to prevent oxidative damage. Vitamin E also plays a role in maintaining cell membrane structure and function, and is necessary for proper immune system function and platelet aggregation. While vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K are important vitamins for various bodily functions, they do not have cellular antioxidant activity. Vitamin D, for example, is important for bone health and is involved in the regulation of calcium ion levels in the body. Vitamin K is necessary for blood clotting and the maintenance of bone and eye health.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": \n(A) Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor is the main cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults. Vitamin B12 is absorbed in the stomach through a protein called intrinsic factor, which is produced by the stomach's parietal cells. As people age, the parietal cells produce less intrinsic factor, leading to reduced absorption of vitamin B12. Helicobacter pylori infection and atrophic gastritis can also contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency, but to a lesser extent.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": \n\n One possible hormonal mediator of the relationship between obesity and endometrial cancer is (C) insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Obesity is known to disrupt glucose and insulin metabolism, which can lead to increased levels of IGF-1 via a negative feedback loop. Higher levels of IGF-1 can stimulate cell growth and cancer progression, particularly in relation to estrogen presentation, and is therefore considered a potential contributor to the increased risk of endometrial cancer observed in obese women. Testosterone and oestrogen are other potential mediators of this relationship, though supporting evidence is weaker. Thyroxine levels, however, are not positively associated with endometrial cancer risk and therefore (D) thyroid hormone is not the appropriate answer.\n\n(C) Insulin-like growth",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": (B) Vitamin D is required for calcium absorption from the small intestine. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a vital role in maintaining healthy bones, muscle function, and the immune system. It also regulates the absorption of calcium from the intestine, which is essential for the development and maintenance of healthy teeth and bones. If the body does not get enough vitamin D from sunlight or dietary sources, it can lead to osteoporosis, muscle weakness, and an increased risk of fractures. So, since calcium absorption requires vitamin D, vitamin D is the correct answer.",

This is a key distinction between amino acids and other nutrients such as carbohydrates and fats, which can be synthesized internally by the body.

            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question! Let's break down each option and determine which one most accurately reflects the human amino acid requirements in human nutrition. \nOption (A) suggests that the amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all ages. While this may be partially true, it is important to note that the requirements for infants and young children are different and will vary depending on their age and physiological state. \nOption (B) states that the amino acid requirements determined for adults are assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages. This is also incorrect, as the requirements for growth and development differ from those of maintenance. \nOption (C) suggests that the amino acid pattern of breast milk is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all children. While breast milk does contain a range of essential amino acids, it is not necessarily the requirement for all children. \nOption (D) states that the amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children. This is correct, as the amino acid composition of human tissue protein is an important source of information about the amino acid requirements of infants and young children. \nBased on this analysis, I would conclude that option (D) is the most accurate statement regarding human amino acid requirements in human nutrition.",
