            "model_answer": ": A) Telomeres are the specialized caps at the end of a chromosome that serves as a protective coating and can also keep track of DNA sequence degradation. In a Robertsonian translocation, chromosomes are fused together at the telomere regions, creating a new larger chromosome. The telomere regions are also known to be regulated by the Sir2 chromatin remodeling complex which helps to maintain chromosome stability.",

            "model_answer": ": \n\nHere's my reasoning step-by-step: \n\nZinc finger proteins are proteins that contain one or more zinc fingers, which are small regions of the protein that can bind to specific sequences in DNA. They are often involved in the regulation of gene expression, but can also play a role in other cellular processes such as DNA repair and protein tyrosine phosphorylation.\n\nHelix-turn-helix proteins are proteins that contain a conserved helix-turn-helix structure that allows them to bind to DNA at specific sequences. They are often involved in the regulation of gene expression, and can also play a role in protein-protein interactions and protein folding.\n\nThe answer is (A) types of DNA-binding proteins.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Malignant hyperthermia is an autosomal recessive trait. This means that a person must inherit two mutant genes for malignant hyperthermia, one from each parent, in order to be affected by the condition. This is in contrast to autosomal dominant traits, which only require the presence of one mutant gene. In parental inheritanceida, autosomal recessive traits are determined by the gender of the parents. If the mutant gene is on the mother's X chromosome, the daughter will inherit the X chromosome with the mutant gene and be affected by the condition. If the mutant gene is on the father's X chromosome, the daughter will inherit the father's X chromosome with the wild-type gene and be unaffected, but the son will have the mutant gene on both his X chromosomes and be affected. If the mutant gene is on the father's chromosome 14 (which is being denoted by the \"14\" in \"autosomal dominant\"), the daughter would inherit the wild-type chromosome 14 and the mother's poison and be unaffected, but the son would inherit the mutant gene on both chromosome 14 and the mother's poison and be affected.

The discovery that most of the DNA is involved in coding for genes (D) was made through mapping studies, as researchers correlated physical locations on the chromosomes with specific genes.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for asking me this question! The final step in intergenerational transmission is for the offspring to carry on those behaviors or exposures to their own offspring. This can occur through both environmental and genetic influences, and is deeply rooted in the concept of Darwinian natural selection, whereby certain behaviors or characteristics become more or less common within a population based on their respective benefits or drawbacks. For example, if a particular behavior or characteristic confers a reproductive advantage (such as increased survival or success in mating), it would become more common within a population over time, leading to intergenerational transmission of that behavior. As for the question at hand, the answer is (D) all of these. While intergenerational transmission can occur through a variety of factors, parental exposures to war, natural disasters, and hunger are all common causes that can lead to the transmission of stressful or traumatic experiences to their offspring. Other factors such as social and cultural pressures can also play a role in intergenerational transmission, as can epigenetic influences such as changes in gene expression that can occur due to exposure to particular environmental toxins or stressors.

The position number (235) indicates the position of the phenylalanine in the protein sequence. If phenylalanine were replaced by asparagine, the corresponding residue could be referred to as Asn235Phe. If aspartic acid were replaced by phenylalanine, the corresponding residue could be referred to as Dsg235Phe.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": Phenylketonuria is a metabolic disorder that affects the brain development of an unattended child whose mother has not treated the condition during pregnancy. The disorder occurs when the Phenylketonuria (PKU) gene is dominant over the gene for the enzyme that breaks down the amino acid Phenylalanine (Phe). Since the enzyme is missing, Phe builds up in the blood, resulting in an elevation of Phe levels in the blood.\nPhe is a common amino acid found in proteins, and it is necessary to neurological development, especially in the early stages of life. If Phe levels in the blood remain high for a long time, it can lead to damage to the neurological system, including mental retardation, seizures, and intellectually impaired.\nThe risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU is almost 100%, as the condition's lack of treatment and the presence of elevated Phe levels in the blood can result in severe neurological disorders in the offspring. The answer is (A) 1% if the mother is treated for PKU during pregnancy and the baby's Phe levels are closely monitored even after birth. The answer is (D) Almost 100% if the mother does not treat the condition and the baby is born with elevated Phe levels.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": Exon skipping occurs when there is a mutation in the DNA sequence that causes the removal or disruption of a segment of exon sequence. This can have a variety of effects on the functionality of the gene and the resulting protein, depending on the size and location of the skipped exon. \nIn some cases, exon skipping may lead to a nonsense mutation, where the retained intron introduces a premature stop codon and causes the production of a nonfunctional protein. In other cases, exon skipping may lead to a regulatory mutation, where the removed exon is involved in regulating the expression of the gene. \nCertain types of RNA processing mutations can also cause exon skipping, where the RNA polymerase fails to correctly read through the exon-intron boundary and skips over a portion of the exon. This can lead to the production of a protein with a frameshift mutation or a missense mutation in the retained exon sequence. \nBased on the given options, (B) regulatory mutations is the most likely explanation for exon skipping in this context.",
