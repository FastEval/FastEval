            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. There are different ways to approach this, but one possible approach is to use information in the public domain. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a report on obesity rates in the United States, which included data on adults aged 18 years or older. According to the report, about 36.5% of adults in the United States were obese, which is defined as having a BMI (body mass index) of 30 or higher. To calculate the percentage, we can subtract the percentage of normal weight adults (BMI 18.5 to 24.9) from 100, and then divide that by the total adult population. Using the latest data available (from the American Community Survey in 2018), the total adult population in the United States is estimated to be about 229.3 million. Therefore, the percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who were overweight in 2016 would be: (36.5% - (18.5% + 18.5% + 18.5%)) / 229.3 million = 60.9% (rounded to one decimal place). Therefore, the answer is (D) 60.9%.",

            "question": "What was GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 when adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices?\n\n(A) About $300\n(B) About $3k\n(C) About $8k\n(D) About $15k",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": (A) About $300 was the answer, and I explain why below. \nFirst, I need to define what GDP per capita means. GDP is the value of all goods and services produced in a country during a certain time period, usually a year. Per capita means that it is divided by the number of people in the country. So in this case, we are asking for the value of goods and services produced in the United States during a certain time period, but divided by the number of people in the United States during that time period. \nNext, I need to adjust for inflation and PPP. PPP refers to the price level in a country when comparing the values of goods and services produced in different countries. Inflation refers to the increase in prices in a country over a certain time period. To adjust for these, we need to convert the values of goods and services produced in the United States to a common price level, then divide by the number of people in the United States. \nIn 1850, the United States had a GDP of $400 billion (in current dollars), and in 2011, the United States had a GDP of $14.4 trillion (in current dollars). To convert the GDP of $400b in 1850 to 2011 prices, we need to first adjust for inflation using a GDP deflator, which would give us a value of approximately $3.2 trillion. We then need to adjust for PPP using a PPP para-tariff, which would give us a value of approximately $6 trillion (rounded to the nearest whole number). \nTo find the answer, we then divide the value of $6 trillion by the number of people in the United States in 1850 and in 2011 (in PPP), respectively. The number of people in the United States in 1850 was approximately 31 million, and in 2011 was approximately 313 million. The value of $6 trillion divided by 31 million in 1850 is approximately $200,000, and divided by 313 million in 2011 is approximately $20,000. Since most answers in PPP are not whole numbers, the smallest possible value is $20,000, which is the answer from choice C. The answer in current dollars would be about $300, which is the answer from choice A.",

This is over three times as much as the second-place country, China, which generated three gigawatts of solar energy in 2019. Germany and Japan were third and fourth, generating two and one gigawatts of solar energy, respectively. Therefore, the answer is (B) United States.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question! In order to answer this question, we need to calculate the GDP per capita in Japan both in 1950 and in 2016, and then compare them using a technique called \u201cPPP-adjustment\u201d (which corrects for differences in purchasing power across countries and over time). Once we have made these adjustments, we can calculate the percentage increase in GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) by 20 fold. In 1950, Japan\u2019s GDP per capita was approximately $678 (in current US dollars). By 2016, this had increased to approximately $46,514. To calculate the percentage increase, we divide the 2016 value by the 1950 value and then multiply by 100. This gives us a value of 22,620 (in 1950, $46,514 would have been equivalent to 22,620 Japanese yen). Since we are seeking a proportion, we divide the result by 100 to get the final answer of (D) by 20 fold.",
