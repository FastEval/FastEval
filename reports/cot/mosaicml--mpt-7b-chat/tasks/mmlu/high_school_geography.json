            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": \n\nThe main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically is the lack of a currency. A currency is necessary for economic activity, as it allows for the exchange of goods and services. Without a currency, there can be no trade or commerce, which limits the potential for economic growth. Additionally, a well-connected transportation infrastructure is important for economic development, as it allows for the efficient transportation of goods and people, which can support industry and commerce. However, while government activity can help to provide necessary infrastructure and services, and banking services can assist with financial transactions, they are not as critical to economic development as a functioning currency. Therefore, the answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": The tendency for a population to continue to grow long after replacement fertility has been achieved is called (D) demographic momentum. \nExplanation: Demographic momentum is the term used to describe the tendency for a population to continue to grow long after replacement fertility has been achieved. This happens when a population is growing at a rate faster than its natural rate of growth, and the overall population size continues to increase over time. The other answers, (A) zero population growth, (B) rapid growth rate, and (C) homeostatic plateau, describe populations that do not experience demographic momentum.",

            "question": "The tendency for migration to decrease with distance is called\n\n(A) push factors.\n(B) pull factors.\n(C) distance decay.\n(D) migration selectivity.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! \nThe answer is (C) distance decay. To understand why, let's think about migration as a process that involves an individual or group moving from one location to another. As the distance between the two locations increases, there are likely to be more and more pull factors that encourage the individual or group to stay in their current location, such as family members, friends, and social support systems. However, there may also be additional push factors at a greater distance, such as better economic opportunities or new experiences. The tendency for migration to decrease with distance is due to the balance of pull and push factors at any given distance.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": Burgess's concentric zone model of urban form is a theoretical framework that describes the spatial organization of cities, dividing them into various zones based on different characteristics. In this model, the central zone contains the city's commercial and cultural core, while the outer zones are characterized by increasing levels of social disintegration and social dilapidation. \nGiven this framework, the zone that contains low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration is likely the outer zone, which is characterized by social disintegration and social dilapidation. \nTherefore, the answer is (D) Fourth.",

Based on the options listed, we can determine which statement is true by examining the following data:\n\n- Option (A) claims that most women work in agriculture. However, while agriculture is a significant employer of women worldwide, it is not the only sector in which women work. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\n- Option (B) claims that the percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide. This is true, as the percentage of women in the labor force worldwide has been steadily declining over the past few decades.\n\n- Option (C) claims that the percentage of women in the total labor force declined. Again, this is TRUE based on the available data.\n\n- Option (D) claims that women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia. This is also TRUE based on the available data.\n\nBased on these statements, we can conclude that the correct answer is (D), as all four statements are TRUE. Therefore, the answer is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": Ok, let\u2019s break this down step-by-step. First of all, there are four possible pull factors of migration, as listed in the question. These are: \n(A) Safety \n(B) Better climate \n(C) Better schools \n(D) Overcrowding \nThe answer is not in the list, which means that it must be one of these four factors. Therefore, we can eliminate all of the factors that are in the list and focus on the one that is not in the list. \nSince the answer is a pull factor of migration, it would have to be something that would make people want to move to a new place. Overcrowding and better schools are things that are likely to make people want to stay in their current place, not move to a new one. Better climate and safety are likely to make people want to move to a new place, and therefore they are the remaining pull factors. \nNow, we need to find the one factor that is likely to make people want to move to a new place, but is not in the list. The answer is (D) Overcrowding. Overcrowding is something that can make people want to move to a new place, as they would likely seek better living conditions in a different location.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": Chain migration is likely the form most commonly practiced by farm workers from another country during the year. This is because chain migration refers to the movement of individuals who are already established in a particular region, and who then bring members of their family or extended social networks to join them in that region. Farm workers are often drawn to particular regions for employment opportunities, and may bring their families with them to live and work in the same area. This form of migration is therefore particularly likely among farm workers, who may be seeking work in specific regions due to the nature of their occupation.",

            "model_answer": ": \nCertainly! Coastlines and rivers are often attractive to early settlers due to their natural resources, such as seafood and water transportation. Rivers can also provide water for agriculture and irrigated farming. Similarly, coastlines offer access to the sea for fishing and trade, which can attract people to settle in those areas. Limited forest cover and a Mediterranean climate may also contribute to high population density, but they are not as important as the other factors listed here. Growth of manufacturing can also attract people to a region, but it is typically only a secondary factor when people settle in an area. Therefore, the answer would be (D) Access to trade routes.",
