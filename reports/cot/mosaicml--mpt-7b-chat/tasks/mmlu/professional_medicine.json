            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": \n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation. The patient describes a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh, which has improved somewhat during the past week. This texture of loss of sensation is consistent with a hematoma in the thigh. While extraneous factors such as intravenous drug use, blood clotting disorders, and motor vehicle accidents should also be considered, the patient's only medication is warfarin, a known risk factor for bleeding and therefore a likely source of the hematoma. Complication of the IVC filter placement and cerebral infarction during the hospitalization are also possible but less likely given the lack of symptoms during the hospitalization. The compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is unlikely as the patient's only reported finding is tingling and numbness, and this is not a motor examination finding.",

            "question": "Six healthy subjects participate in a study of muscle metabolism during which hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia is induced.

The increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits which of the following processes in these subjects?\n\n(A) Fatty acid oxidation\n(B) Fatty acid synthesis\n(C) Gluconeogenesis\n(D) Glycogenolysis",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ":\nGreat question! First, we need to understand what malonyl-CoA is and what its role in metabolism is. Malonyl-CoA is an intermediate compound in the downstream of fatty acid metabolism, specifically in the \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids. This means that it is produced as a byproduct of the breakdown of fatty acids in the mitochondria, and it plays a role in regulating the oxidation of fatty acids. \nNow, back to the question. The incitation of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in these subjects leads to an increase in malonyl-CoA production. Increased malonyl-CoA is known to inhibit the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, which is the enzyme responsible for the final step of fatty acid oxidation, i.e. the breakdown of fatty acids into acetyl-CoA. Thus, if malonyl-CoA concentrations are elevated, there will be decreased substrate availability for fatty acid oxidation, and this will likely decrease the overall rates of fatty acid oxidation in these subjects. \nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Glycogenolysis, as this process will likely be less affected by elevated malonyl-CoA levels than fatty acid oxidation, and it will still provide some source of glucose for energy production in these subjects.\nAnswer: (D) Glycogenolysis",
