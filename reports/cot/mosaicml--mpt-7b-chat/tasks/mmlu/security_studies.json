            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we must examine each of the four principles listed, and determine which one does not fit with the concept of the responsibility to protect.\nThe responsibility to protect includes the principle of responsibility to prevent, as well as the responsibility to react, and the responsibility to rebuild. However, the responsibility to remain sovereign does not fit with the responsibility to protect, as that principle involves the duty to take action to prevent harm, rather than passively allowing harm to occur and then reacting to it. Therefore, the correct answer is (D), the responsibility to rebuild.<|im_end|>",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

            "model_answer": ": The expanded international criminal market in the wake of the Cold War created a sense of urgency to respond to the increasing threat of transnational crime. Governments initially responded by criminalizing the actions of non-state actors and increasing investigation and prosecution of transnational gangs. However, the neoliberal economic policies implemented after the Cold War created a permissive environment for organized crime networks, leading to the ineffective deterrence of most state actions. As a result, the only viable strategy for the effective control of transnational crime has become a coordinated response from all states, including the militarization of law enforcement through the adoption of technology and intelligence gathering techniques.\nThe answer is (C).

Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated.\n(D) Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated.

This has led to a potential problem for policy in the institutionalization of academe-policy interaction, particularly with regard to the exclusion of academic voices from policymaking. This emergence has been driven by the increasing institutionalization of academe-policy interaction, which has resulted in a dominance of policy constituent engagement over academic voices. This is problematic because policymaking benefits from diverse perspectives, including those of scholars and experts in various fields, including security studies. Moreover, such exclusion may lead to policy decisions that are not well-informed or based on inaccurate information.<|im_end|>",
