            "model_answer": ": Before answering this question, we need to understand what nearsightedness is and what causes it. Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is a refractive error that occurs when the eye focuses light in front of the retina. This is the part of the eye that detects images. People with nearsightedness see clearly objects that are close to them, but objects that are further away appear blurry. The answer to the question is (A) too much curvature of the cornea and lens.<|im_end|>",

            "model_answer": ": Thank you for asking this question. Based on the information provided, I would suggest that the answer is (D) Hierarchy of needs, as proposed by Abraham Maslow. This approach suggests that there are certain needs that are more imperative to survival than others, and these needs must be fulfilled in order to achieve self-actualization and overall wellbeing. These needs are categorized into five levels, ranging from basic physiological needs to the highest level of self-actualization. Although (A) Homeostatic regulation, (B) Goal-setting, and (C) Expectancy-value are also important in achieving successful personal and professional development, Maslow considered them to be less imperative to survival than the hierarchy of needs.

            "model_answer": "Thank you for the question. To determine the heritability of a trait in a cloned population, we need to calculate the percentage of genetic variance that can be explained by the trait. \n(A) 0%: \nThe heritability in a non-cloned population means that the trait is not responsible for any genetic variation in the population. In a cloned population, all individuals share the same genes. Therefore, the genetic variance is zero and the heritability is zero as well. \n(B) 25%: \nThe heritability in a non-cloned population means that the trait is responsible for some genetic variation in the population. If a cloned population is not a pure line, it can have some genetic variation due to genetic differences shared by different individuals in the population. The heritability can be 25% if there is a large amount of genetic variation in the traits of the individuals. \n(C) 50%: \nThe heritability in a non-cloned population means that the trait is responsible for half of the genetic variation in the population. In a cloned population, the heritability can be 50% if there is a moderate amount of genetic variation in the traits of the individuals. This means that the trait is contributing to half of the genetic variation in the population. \n(D) 75%: \nThe heritability in a non-cloned population means that the trait is responsible for most (or all) of the genetic variation in the population. In a cloned population, the heritability can be 75% if there is a high amount of genetic variation in the traits of the individuals. This means that the trait is contributing to most of the genetic variation in the population. \nTherefore, the answer is (B) 25%.<|im_end|>",

This option states that all school psychologists who will be supervising in a school district should be fully certified or licensed with the appropriate credentials, including the Nationally Certified School Psychologist credential or the state school psychologist credential. Option (A) is incorrect since this option states that school psychologists only need to provide supervision to school psychologists who are not fully certified or licensed, and to any school psychology interns.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Erikson's psychosocial stage theory explains how experiences in infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age influence later personality characteristics. Erikson believed that humans go through eight stages of development, including infancy (birth to 1 year), childhood (1 to about age 2 years), adolescence (ages 13 to 18 years), young adulthood (ages 18 to 25 years), adulthood (ages 25 to 60 years), older adulthood (ages 60 to 80 years), and finally, old age (80 and older). Each stage of development is marked by critical questions that must be answered, or \"identity crises\" that must be resolved, for healthy development to occur. For example, during the infancy stage, babies must develop trust in their caregivers, whereas during the adolescence stage, teenagers must develop a sense of autonomy and intimacy with their peers. During the adulthood stage, adults must establish a sense of competence and a sense of purpose or meaning in life. During the old age stage, older adults must establish a sense of completence (i.e., a feeling of having lived a full life and having contributed to society), as well as a sense of acceptance or surrender to the inevitability of death. Overall, Erikson's theory posits that experiences in each developmental stage shape later personality characteristics, such as self-esteem, maturity, motivation, and worldview.<|im_end|>",
