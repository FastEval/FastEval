This conclusion is reached by examining the argument as a whole, using logical deduction to identify the main point or key conclusion(s). In this case, the argument explores the difficulties involved in convincing others of the unconscious mind and teaching them about contradictory conscious knowledge. From this point, it is reasonable to conclude that convincing others of the unconscious is difficult, as well as teaching them about contradictory conscious knowledge.

Because K \u2261 L means that K and L are simultaneously equivalent, the argument is true when K = TRUE and L = TRUE. The remaining two rows where K is TRUE and L is FALSE or where K is FALSE and L is TRUE are both false because the second conjunct of the argument is negated: ~L. \n\nFor the second option (B), we see that the argument is false for the row where K = TRUE and L = TRUE, because the second conjunct of the argument is false: L is false. However, the remaining rows are still true because the second conjunct is negated, and we can substitute either K or L for the variable L. \n\nFor the third option (C), we see that the argument is still true for the row where K = TRUE and L = FALSE, because the second conjunct is negated: L has the opposite truth value to K, and we can substitute either K for L or L for K. However, the remaining row where L is TRUE and K is FALSE is still false because the left-hand side of the argument is false: K and L have opposite truth values. \n\nFor the fourth option (D), we see that the argument is invalid for the row where K = TRUE and L = TRUE because the contrapositive is not true, violating the law of coercion: ~K \u2261 ~(K \u2227 L) / (K \u2228 L), which implies that ~K only follows from K \u2228 L when K \u2261 L. Therefore, the argument is invalid because of this contrapositive.
