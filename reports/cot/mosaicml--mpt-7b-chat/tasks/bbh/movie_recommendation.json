To find a movie similar to Forrest Gump, The Silence of the Lambs, Seven, Fargo, we first need to consider the key characteristics of each of those films. \nForrest Gump is a comedy-drama about a man who experiences a wide range of adventures and encounters over the course of several decades. The Silence of the Lambs is a thriller about a young FBI agent who enlists the help of a criminal psychologist to catch a serial killer. Seven is a suspense thriller set in rural China in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, about a group of hired killers who must complete a series of increasingly difficult and dangerous tasks. Fargo is a dark comedy-crime film about two brothers who hire a group of criminals to help them rob a bank.\nGiven these characteristics, we can see that movies like Gandhi and Schindler's List are not very similar to Forrest Gump, The Silence of the Lambs, Seven, or Fargo. Dogfight is a martial arts film set during the Vietnam War, which also features some elements of a crime or heist movie, but is less similar to the other films in this list.
