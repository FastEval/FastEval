This problem can be solved by using the principle of inclusion and exclusion. \nInclusion means that we want to add up all the items that are present on the table. Therefore, we add the three pink scrunchiephone chargers and two orange crayons to get a total of five items.\nExclusion means that we want to subtract all the items that are not present on the table.
