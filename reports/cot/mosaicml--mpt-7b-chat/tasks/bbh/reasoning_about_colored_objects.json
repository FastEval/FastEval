Therefore, we can eliminate green and red from our list of objects that are neither black nor blue. \nNow we know that at least one of the objects is purple, brown, black, or orange. We can attempt to narrow down the possibilities in the following way. Given that the bracelet is green and the dog leash is red, it must be the case that both of these objects are either green or red. Therefore, if we add up the number of green and red objects in the scenario, we can determine how many objects are neither black nor blue. In this case, since there is only one bracelet and one dog leash, we know that the bracelet and dog leash must both be green or red. This means that there can be no more than two green or red objects in the scenario. However, since there are three green or red objects on the floor (the bracelet and the dog leash, as well as the green fidget spinner), we can see that there are indeed more than two green or red objects in the scenario.

Let's start by considering the cat toy: if the puzzle were placed next to the cat toy, then it would be directly between the cat toy and the blue stress ball, which would not make sense since the stress ball is much closer to the puzzle than the cat toy is. Therefore, the cat toy cannot be next to the red puzzle. This means that the cat toy must be between the red puzzle and the stress ball, making it either the first or second object in the row (the stress ball is the first object). Since the cat toy is even further away from the red puzzle than the stress ball is, it must be the second object in the row.
