The given table has three pink scrunchiephone chargers, two orange crayons, and two black scrunchiephone chargers. \nStep 2: Since the question asks for the number of scrunchiephone chargers remaining after removing all the black items, we need to consider the pink and orange ones as well. \nStep 3: The question does not specify the order in which the black items are removed, so we can't determine the number of scrunchiephone chargers remaining before removing them. \nStep 4: Therefore, we can't answer the question yet. \nStep 5: Let's come up with a plan to find the answer. We can use trial and error, starting with the smallest number of black items removed (1). \nStep 6: If we remove 1 black scrunchiephone charger, there will be two remaining (2). \nStep 7: If we remove 2 black scrunchiephone chargers, there will be one remaining (1). \nStep 8: Therefore, the answer is 1. \nStep 9: The final answer is (1).",
