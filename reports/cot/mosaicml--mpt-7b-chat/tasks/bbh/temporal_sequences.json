So the earliest possible time that Susan could have gone to the restaurant would be 4pm (if she took a short break in between Jennifer and William's sightings), or 8pm (if she took a break between Jason's sighting and Ashley's sighting).

We know that Leslie woke up at 5am and that Richard saw her buying a phone at the electronics store from 5am to 7am. We also know that Jason saw Leslie waiting at the airport from 11am to 6pm and that David saw Leslie attending class at the school from 6pm to 10pm. Finally, we know that the clothing store was closed after 10pm. \nBased on this information, we can rule out option (C) 7am to 11am because we know that Leslie woke up at 5am and we don't know what time she went to the electronics store or the airport. We can also rule out option (D) 6pm to 10pm because we know that David saw Leslie attending class at the school from 6pm to 10pm. \nThis leaves us with option (A) 11am to 6pm and option (B) 5am to 7am. \nSince we know that Richard saw Leslie buying a phone at the electronics store from 5am to 7am, we can deduce that they didn't buy the phone on the way to the airport or attending class. Therefore, we can safely assume that Leslie visited the electronics store before attending class. \nSimilarly, since we know that Jason saw Leslie waiting at the airport from 11am to 6pm, we can deduce that they didn't wait at the airport before attending class. Therefore, we know that Leslie waited at the airport before 11am. \nPutting all this information together, the only time when Leslie could have gone to the clothing store is between 11am and 6pm. Therefore, the answer is (A) 11am to 6pm.",

Let's start by breaking down the given information and trying to piece together a timeline for Jessica's activities.\nFirst, we know that Jessica woke up at 5am. Then, we know that Michael saw Jessica buying clothes at the mall from 5am to 6am, and that Steven saw Jessica buying a bike at the bike shop from 6am to 7am. Next, we know that Sean saw Jessica waiting at the train station from 7am to 2pm, and that Elizabeth saw Jessica taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 2pm to 6pm. Finally, we know that Sarah saw Jessica walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 6pm to 9pm.\nNow, we know that the basketball court was closed after 10pm. This means that Jessica could not have gone to the basketball court between 10pm and 2pm (when Elizabeth saw Jessica). This also means that Jessica could not have gone to the basketball court between 7am and 10pm (when Sarah saw Jessica).\nTherefore, the only possible time that Jessica could have gone to the basketball court is from 6pm to 9pm (when Michael saw Jessica, and when Elizabeth saw Jessica). \nQuestion answered!
