The remaining options, (B) and (E), were the only ones that accurately reflected a date in December of 1937. However, (B) was the more accurate option, as it reflects a date immediately after the holiday, while (E) is four years in the past, and therefore not a valid option.",

            "model_answer": "OK, let's start by looking at the question. The person in the UK probably put today as 02/01/1987 for a few reasons. Firstly, the first day of the month comes before the second, so 02/01 is a valid date in the UK format. Secondly, the person probably didn't write today's date in a way that would make it obvious to others that it was today. Finally, the person may have used abbreviated months, which is common in the UK, so 1986 is likely to be December and not January. \nNow let's move on to the question. If the date one month ago was in the same format, then it can only be either 01/30/1986 or 02/01/1986. However, since the question says \"a month ago\", we can conclude that it must be 02/01/1986, since it was a Sunday one month ago.\nTherefore, the answer is (E) (F) 02/06/1987, which is the date one month ago in the format of Month/Day/Year, with February 6th as the date.",

Jane and John got married on Jan 2, which puts the wedding day exactly five years before today.

If today is her 5th visit, then we know that today must be either February 16th or March 13th (assuming her visits are in increasing order of date). We also know that Jane visits the bookstore for a different reason every month. Therefore, she certainly did not visit on either January 26th or August 16th, since those days have different reasons, and we can eliminate those days from the list of possible dates.\nNow we can use a calendar to figure out when Jane visited on February 16th and March 13th. Let's assume that Jane visits in increasing order of date, so the earliest date she could have visited would be January 1st, 2009. We know that January 1st fell on a Sunday in 2009, so the earliest possible date Jane could have visited on the 16th would be February 14th, 2009. We can cross-check this with the fact that Jane has already visited today, which would mean her latest possible visit would be on February 14th, so we know February 16th must be correct.\nTherefore, Jane's visit on February 16th, 2009, is the date one year ago from today, and the answer is (B) 02/16/2009.",

            "correct_answer": "(A)",
            "model_answer": "Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step. First, we need to figure out how often Jane ate eggs per day. Since she ate one egg per day, this means she had 40 / 30 = 1.33 eggs left until the end of the month. However, since she ran out of eggs, we need to round up to the nearest integer, so let's assume she had 40 eggs left. \nNext, we need to find the day of the week on which Jane would have finished eating all the eggs. Since she ate one egg per day, we can subtract one from the number of days left, which is 40. This gives us 39 days. The day of the week with 39 days left until the end of the month is Wednesday. \nNow we can use this information to work backwards to find the date on which Jane would have finished eating all the eggs. Since she ate one egg per day, we can simply subtract one from the total number of eggs left until the end of the month, which is 40. This gives us 39. \nFinally, we can add the day of the week on which Jane would have finished eating all the eggs to the date on which she finished eating all the eggs, which is Friday. We add one because we are counting from the end of the month. \nSo, the date 24 hours after Jane bought 40 eggs and ate one per day is Friday, June 17th, 2017 (06/17/2017). \nTherefore, the answer is (F) 07/10/2017.",

            "model_answer": "(A) 08/29/1909 is the date 10 days ago, which was August 29th, 1909 in MM/DD/YYYY format. \nHere's how to arrive at this answer: The question asks what the date was 10 days ago, which means we need to subtract 10 days from today's date. Since today is September 9th, we need to subtract 9 days from today. To do this, we need to find the date 9 days ago, which is August 30th, 1909. \nTo find the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, we need to convert the day of the month (30th) to the corresponding month (August) and then subtract 9 days from that date. We can do this by finding the date 9 days ago in the same month (August), which is August 26th, 1909. \nSubtracting 9 days from August 26th, 1909 gives us August 20th, 1909. However, this is not the date 10 days ago, so we need to subtract 1 more day from August 20th, 1909 to get August 19th, 1909. \nTherefore, the answer is 08/29/1909, which is the date 10 days ago that corresponds to August 29th, 1909.",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you solve that riddle! \nFirst, we need to determine the month and day one year ago from today. We can do this by subtracting one year from the current date of May 4th, 2004 and then figuring out what day and month that is. \nOne year ago from today would have been May 4th, 2003. So we can subtract one year from the current date of May 4th, 2004 to get: \nMay 4th, 2003 - May 4th, 2004 = May 4th, 2003 \nNext, we need to figure out what day and month that is. We can do this by combining the day and month of May 4th, 2003. \nSo the day is May 4th, and the month is May. Therefore, the answer is (A) 06/14/2003. \nSince the final answer should be a single letter with parenthesis, the answer is (A). I hope that explanation was helpful!",
