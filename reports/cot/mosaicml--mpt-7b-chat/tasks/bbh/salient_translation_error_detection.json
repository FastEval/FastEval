We'll read the translation out loud as we go, to help identify errors: \"Elbenberg is a subset of Naumburg, located in the territory of Tossel in the northern region of Hesse, Germany.\" \nOk, so we have the same structure as the original clause. We have a noun followed by a prepositional phrase, and then another noun.
