Since their weights are 11 kg and 13 kg, respectively, and the weight of James is 12 kg, Vincent must be taller than Bernard. Also, the height of James is 90 cm, so Vincent must be taller than 90 cm to be 60 cm tall. That means Vincent's height must be between 90 cm and 60 cm. That narrows the possibilities to 80 cm and 70 cm. We can eliminate 80 cm because Vincent's weight is known to be 11 kg, and 80 cm x 11 kg/1000 = 864000 cm\u00b2, which is greater than the surface area of a 60 cm tall penguin (50 cm\u00b2).
