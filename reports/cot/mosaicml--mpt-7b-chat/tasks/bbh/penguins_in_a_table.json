This means we need to find all the penguins whose weight is greater than x + 12.\nLooking at the original table, we know that Gwen's weight is 15, Vincent's weight is 11, and James's weight is 12. So, x would equal the weight of James. We know that Bernard's weight was 11, Louis's weight is 11, and the weight of the penguin we just added is 12. So, x + 12 would equal the weight of the last penguin that weighed more than 12 kg. Therefore, x + 12 is exactly 15. This means we need to find all the penguins whose weight is more than 15 kg. \nTo do this, we simply need to find the penguins whose weight is greater than 15. Looking at the original table, the penguins whose weight is more than 15 kg are Gwen and James. (B) 2 penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg. ((B) The answer is two.)",
