            "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are friends and avid readers who occasionally trade books. At the start of the semester, they each buy one new book: Alice gets The Great Gatsby, Bob gets Frankenstein, and Claire gets Ulysses.\nAs the semester proceeds, they start trading around the new books. First, Alice and Claire swap books. Then, Bob and Claire swap books. Finally, Claire and Alice swap books. At the end of the semester, Alice has\nOptions:\n(A) The Great Gatsby\n(B) Frankenstein\n(C) Ulysses",
            "correct_answer": "(B)",
            "model_answer": ": First, let's calculate how many books each person has at the end of the semester. During the semester, Alice and Claire swap books, which means that they end up with different books. Since Alice initially had The Great Gatsby and Claire initially had Ulysses, Alice must have traded The Great Gatsby for Ulysses, and Claire must have traded Ulysses for The Great Gatsby. This means that Alice has The Great Gatsby and Ulysses, and Claire has The Great Gatsby and Ulysses. Bob and Alice trade, which means that Bob ends up with The Great Gatsby and Ulysses, and Alice ends up with Frankenstein and Ulysses. This means that Alice has The Great Gatsby and Ulysses, Bob has Frankenstein and Ulysses, and Claire has The Great Gatsby, Ulysses, and William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Therefore, the answer is (B), Frankenstein.<|im_end|>",
