Based on the clues given, we know that Bob and Claire have both read Frankenstein but not Ulysses, so Bob must have gotten that book and is now trading it. Since Bob and Claire are trading books, we know that Alice will end up with either Frankenstein or Lolita. Let's assume for the sake of this argument that Alice gets Frankenstein, which was not originally Bob's book. \nThen, we know that Claire and Bob swap books. This means that Bob's book (which is now Frankenstein) will end up in the hands of someone who was originally Claire's friend, which must be Alice (who gets Frankenstein). Bob and Alice will then swap books, leaving Alice with Lolita and Bob with Ulysses. This is the only possible scenario consistent with the given clues. Therefore, the answer is (C).",
