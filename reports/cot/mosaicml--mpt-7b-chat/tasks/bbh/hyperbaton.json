Both options place \"tan\" at the end. \nFrom a grammatical perspective, placing \"silly\" before \"old-fashioned\" in option (A) makes more sense, as \"silly\" is modifying the noun \"dog\" more specifically. However, placing \"old-fashioned\" before \"silly\" in option (B) does not change the meaning of the sentence, as it still describes the dog as being \"silly and old-fashioned\".

Therefore, the correct order is \"American nice computer\". \nIf we were to reverse the order, it would become \"nice American computer\", which is incorrect.
