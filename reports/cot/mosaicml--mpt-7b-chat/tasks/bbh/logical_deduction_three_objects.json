We also know that there are three books in total, and they are color-coded as follows: one is green, one is red, and one is blue. \nNext, we're given that the red book is the rightmost book on the shelf. This means that the red book must be the book that is closest to the edge of the shelf. \nNow, we're also given that the blue book is to the right of the green book.

Therefore, Eve must have finished second or third, leaving only two possible options: (B) Rob finished third, and (C) Rob finished first.\nHowever, we cannot immediately choose (B) without assuming the impossible, i.e. that Eve finished third but Rob finished second.

Since Eve finished first and Mel finished third in the explicit statements, we know that (A) and (B) cannot both be true.
