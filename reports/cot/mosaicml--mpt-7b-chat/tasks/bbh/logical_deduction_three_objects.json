            "model_answer": "Let's start by looking at the first sentence. It says that there are three birds arranged in a fixed order. Since there are only three birds, we know that they must be arranged in a linear fashion, either in a row or a column. Since each bird is mentioned individually, it must be the case that the birds are arranged in a row. \nNow, let's look at the ordering of the birds. The falcon is to the right of the blue jay, and the blue jay is to the right of the quail. This means that the quail must be to the left of the blue jay, and the falcon must be to the right of the quail. \nSo, we have two possibilities: \n1. The quail is to the left of the blue jay and the falcon is to the right of the quail. In this case, the blue jay must be to the right of the falcon. However, this would mean that the blue jay is to the right of the falcon and the quail, which is inconsistent with the first sentence.\n2. The quail is to the right of the blue jay and the falcon is to the left of the quail. In this case, the blue jay must be to the left of the falcon. However, this would mean that the blue jay is to the left of the falcon and the quail, which is also inconsistent with the first sentence.\nThis leaves us with only one possibility: \n(C) The falcon is the second from the left",
