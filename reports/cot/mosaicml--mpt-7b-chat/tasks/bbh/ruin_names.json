On the other hand, edits (A) 'ruin man', (C) 'rain men', and (D) 'rainmman' do not sound or look like the original name 'rain man' and therefore are not humorous edits.

That also happens to be the third word in the sentence, which we can call the 'third noun'. \nNow, let's think about what it might mean to edit that sentence. One way to do that would be to change that third noun. So we could say 'the third dog', or 'the third cat', and we might call that an 'oral edit'. This edit doesn't change the sentence's meaning, but it does change how we understand it. \nSo now we can try different edits in the same way. For example, if we want to make a humorous edit, we might want to change that third noun so that it's unexpected. \nNow, let's think about some actual edits. \n(A) the third men: This edit doesn't actually make much sense. It's plausible that someone might make this mistake if they're talking fast or if they've misspoken. But it doesn't look like a humorous mistake to me. It just looks like someone's mispronounced 'man'. If we wanted to make a humorous edit, we might say something like (B) the trird man. That looks like a misheard or mispronounced word, and that could be humorous if it's unexpected. \n(C) thed third man: This edit also doesn't make much sense. If I heard someone say 'the third man' then I would assume they meant 'the third letter is \"m\"'. \n(D) the third pan: This edit doesn't make sense either, since there's nothing about the original sentence that suggests the third noun is a pan.
