One way would be to urge someone to do something, which is relatively mild and probably not angry or serious. The other way would be to plead with someone, which is a lot more intense and probably indicates some kind of insecurity or fear. \nFor me, the sarcastic answer is option (B) because that is the more intense and dramatic way of expressing a threat or urgency, while the more mild choice (A) is actually the less sarcastic one.

It is much easier\" is not sarcastic because the speaker is genuinely trying to help the person who is poor.\nOn the other hand, the statement \"Have you tried not being rude? It is much easier\" is sarcastic because it is suggesting that being rude is easy and does not require any effort. The statement is implying that rudeness is a common habit that people can easily fall into, without any consequences. It's a tongue-in-cheek statement that suggests being rude is a harmless and easy thing to do. Therefore, the use of parentheses and the word \"much\" make it clear that the statement is sarcastic.",

This is because the speaker is using \"Yeah\" to indicate agreement with the statement, but then quickly qualifying their agreement by saying \"but actually let's build lightrail instead.\" The qualifier \"but actually\" indicates that the speaker does not really agree with the statement, but is pretending to agree in order to make some kind of point. The actual point being made by the speaker is that they want to get rid of the trams and replace them with lightrail, despite the fact that they are pretending to agree with keeping the trams.

The claim that height is an accurate measure of some quality (such as \"tallness\") is clearly false and a simplistic stereotype. Thus the statement is sarcastic because it is saying the opposite of what it appears to say. It is making a face-value claim about non-tall people, but is actually making a critical commentary on superficial stereotypes based on superficial physical characteristics. The statement is not intended to convey the literal meaning of the claim which is that the person is tall, but rather to imply the opposite stereotypical meaning of the claim that non-tall people have other positive qualities. This is a common and subtle form of sarcasm, which says one thing and means another, in a tongue-in-cheek and playful way. Thus the answer is (B), \"He's over six feet, so he must be wonderful\".",

The inclusion of anarchism as an example of a \"governing system\" is absurd and can only be interpreted as an attempted sarcastic critique of the political establishment. \n\n(B) is sarcastic for much the same reason. Democracy is not a governing system, but rather a form of government based on the vote of the people. Again, including democracy as an example of a \"governing system\" is absurd and intended as a satirical statement opposing the democratic status quo. \n\nTherefore, the answer is always false, and sarcastic, always including at least one of the following responses: \"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha",
