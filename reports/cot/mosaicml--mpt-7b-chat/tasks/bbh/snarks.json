Here's my step-by-step explanation of this challenging issue:\n\n(1) Firstly, it's important to examine the context in which the statement was made, as sarcasm often relies on additional information or situational context that is not present in the given options. \n(2) Secondly, it's important to consider the speaker's tone and body language, which can often provide crucial cues about the speaker's intent and sarcasm.\n(3) Thirdly, it's important to look at the words themselves and consider the possible meanings, which may not be immediately obvious through just pure textual analysis. \n(4) Based on the above factors, I would answer that the option presented as (B) is the one that is sarcastic. This is because the statement itself is highly unlikely, and therefore sarcastic, if taken literally. If the speaker truly believed that \"he should have just let them get away for assaulting him\" then that would be a very unfortunate stance to take for sure. Additionally, the fact that the speaker is blaming the victim for not standing up for themselves as \"they\" are witnesses suggests that they are not in a particularly sympathetic or supportive position. Therefore, the statement is highly unlikely to be taken seriously if taken at face value, but may have a different and more sarcastic meaning if the speaker is trying to express their disbelief that a victim \"should just let assaulters walk free\".",

Sarcasm is a form of ironic speech or writing meant to convey a different meaning from what is literally said, and in this case the speaker is exaggerating the cost of fuel in order to make a point or express their frustration with the high cost of transportation. Statement (A) lacks this sarcastic tone and simply describes the cost of fuel in a neutral manner.",
