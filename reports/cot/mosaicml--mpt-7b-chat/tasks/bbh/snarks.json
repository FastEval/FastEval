            "model_answer": ": Great question! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n(1) The phrase \"trying to promote\" insinuates that the person has some ulterior motive for promoting the charity stream, which raises suspicion.\n(2) The phrase \"have raised millions\" is overly optimistic and contradicts the implication that the person is doing it for self-benefit. Therefore, option (B) is likely sarcastic, as it suggests the person is only promoting the stream to appear charitable but in reality has no true intention of helping children in need.<|im_end|>",

The use of the words \"be happy\" indicates that the person is attempting to cheer someone up, but their overall message is one of disappointment or negativity. This suggests that the speaker is likely feeling unhappy or sad, but is trying to appear positive and upbeat in order to avoid conversation or confrontation. Statement (A), on the other hand, appears to convey a sincere desire to help the listener feel better, despite the fact that the speaker themselves may not be feeling particularly positive.

            "correct_answer": "(B)",
            "model_answer": ": This is a classic example of sarcasm. Let me explain why. Both statements are saying essentially the same thing, that the speaker has never had a takeout meal in their life. However, the way they are saying it is in a way that is clearly absurd. For example, if someone really just had a takeout meal that used hardwood containers, it would be extremely rare, and the speaker would probably know someone who had one. Therefore, if they say \"I've never had a takeout meal that used hardwood containers before!\" it sounds like they are declaring their personal experience to be much broader than it actually is. Similarly, if someone really just had a takeout meal that used plastic containers, it would also be extremely rare, so saying \"I've never had a takeout meal that used plastic containers before!\" sounds equally absurd. Either statement is plausible on its own, but together they contradict each other, which is the whole point of sarcasm. Sarcasm is often used to express disbelief or disbelief in certain situations or ideas, and in this case both statements are designed to indicate that the speaker is lying to an extreme degree about their personal experience.

            "correct_answer": "(A)",
            "model_answer": "(B) Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build lightrail instead. This statement is sarcastic because (1) trams and lightrail are both types of public transportation that have similar benefits and drawbacks, and (2) eliminating trams would most likely not lead to the construction of lightrail, since it would require a completely different infrastructure. Thus, the assertion is ironic, because it proposes the elimination of an alternative that is not actually preferable to the status quo.<|im_end|>",

            "model_answer": "(A) He's over six feet, so he must be tall is sarcastic because it implies that someone's height is the only good thing about them, which is an obvious exaggeration and a sarcastic way of saying that they have other great qualities besides their height. To find this out, one would have to analyze the context and the tone in which the statement is made.\n\nRationale: The word \"wonderful\" is generally an adjective that is used to describe positive qualities, such as kindness or intelligence. However, the speaker uses the word \"wonderful\" to describe someone who is \"over six feet,\" which is a physical characteristic that can be both positive and neutral, depending on the context. Therefore, saying that someone's physical characteristic is the only good thing about them is sarcastic because it assumes that physical appearance is the only important aspect of someone's character.<|im_end|>",
