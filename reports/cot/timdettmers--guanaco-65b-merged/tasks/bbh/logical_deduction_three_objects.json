The trick is to figure out which object is in the middle, since that will be the second-most expensive.\n\nLet's start with paragraph 1. The peaches are more expensive than the apples, and the mangoes are the cheapest. So we can ruled out the mangoes for being the second-most expensive.

Is there any other information we can use to figure this out?\n\nParagraph 2 looks like it has similar information, but with a different set of objects. We have oranges, grapes, and bananas, with oranges being the most expensive and bananas being the cheapest. Again, we can rule out the bananas being the second-most expensive. That means it has to be either the oranges or the grapes.\n\nIn paragraph 3, we again have three objects: eggs, flour, and milk. Eggs are the most expensive, and milk is the cheapest. This time, we can rule out the milk being the second-most expensive, so it has to be either the eggs or the flour.\n\nLooking at all three paragraphs, it seems like the answer is (C).

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'll be happy to answer your question step-by-step! Let's start by breaking down each paragraph and analyzing the information it provides:\n\nIn the first paragraph, it says that:\n* There were three golfers: Ada, Mel, and Mya.\n* Mya finished below Ada.\n* Mel finished above Ada.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that:\n\n1. Mya finished in either 2nd or 3rd place, since she finished below Ada who finished in 1st place.\n2. Mel finished in either 1st or 2nd place, since she finished above Ada who finished in 1st place.\n\nIn the second paragraph, it says that:\n* Ada finished in last place.\n\nFrom this statement, we can conclude that:\n\n1. Mya and Mel must have finished in 1st and 2nd place, respectively, since Ada finished in last place.\n\nIn the third paragraph, it says that:\n* Mel finished in last place.\n\nFrom this statement, we can conclude that:\n\n1. There must be a contradiction, since Mel finished in 2nd place according to paragraph 2, but is now said to have finished in last place.\n\nBased on these conclusions, we can reject option C (Mya finished last) since paragraph 2 tells us that Mya finished in either 1st or 2nd place. We can also reject option A (Ada finished last) since paragraph 2 tells us that Ada finished in 1st place.\n\nThat leaves us with option B (Mel finished last). However, given the contradictory information in paragraph 3, we can conclude that option B is also incorrect.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, there is no logically consistent answer to the question. The final answer",

In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Mel, Ada, and Ana. Mel finished last. Ana finished second.\nOptions:\n(A) Mel finished last\n(B) Ada finished last\n(C) Ana finished last",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'm happy to explain my reasoning step-by-step.\n\nSo let's begin:\n\nThe first paragraph states that Mel finished last in the golf tournament. This means Ana and Ada finished ahead of Mel, but we don't know their exact order.\n\nThe second paragraph says that Ana finished second, which means she must have finished ahead of Mel but behind someone else.\n\nPutting these two paragraphs together, we can conclude that Ada finished first. Ana finished second, and Mel finished last.\n\nGoing back to the options you gave, we can eliminate (B) because Ada finished first. We can also eliminate (C) because Mel is the one who finished last.\n\nThe correct answer is (A), Mel finished last.\n\n(Mel finished last)",
