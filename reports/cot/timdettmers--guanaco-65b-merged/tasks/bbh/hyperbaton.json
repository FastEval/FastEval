            "model_answer": "Sure I can do this. The question is which sentence has the correct adjective order:\nOptions:\n(A) midsize old grey Brazilian sweater\n(B) midsize grey Brazilian old sweater\n\nThis is a good question about English language adjective order. To explain my reasoning I will describe what adjectives are and when they are necessary.\n\nIn English, adjectives are used to describe or modify nouns or pronouns. The adjectives tell us something more about the noun or pronoun. For example, we can use adjectives to describe the size, color, age, origin.\n\nIn the given question, the noun is \"sweater\" and in both sentences you have provided adjectives to describe it using size, age, color and origin.\n\nTo decide whether an adjective is necessary we must think about whether the sentence is clear and conveys the information we want to convey without the adjective. In this case the sentence does not mention sweater and if we say \"midsize old Grey Brazilian\" it could be something other than a sweater. Similarly if we say \"midsize grey Brazilian\" it could be something other than a sweater and if we say \"Brazilian midsize grey\" it could be something other than a sweater. So we do need all the adjectives to described the sweater.\n\nThe next question is whether the adjectives are in the correct order. Here I will describe the typical order of adjectives in English. The typical order of adjectives in English is\n1) Determiners (e.g. \"the\", \"this\" \"a\")\n2) Adjective that says something about the type of object (e.g. \"sweater\")\n3) Adjectives that describe physical properties of the object (e.g. \"",

So in this case, the correct adjective order would be:\n\n2. In option (A), the adjective of quantity/number \"midsize\" is correct, but the order of the remaining adjectives is not in the standard pattern. \"gray\" is an adjective of quality and should come before \"walking\" (a verb). \"Mexican\" is an article and should come after \"gray\". \"Mexican\" is not an adjective, but a nationality, so it doesn't follow the adjective order pattern. \"rubber\" is also not an adjective, but a noun and should not be used as an adjective. Option (A) is not correct.\n\n3. In option (B), the adjective of quantity/number \"midsize\" is correct, and the order of the remaining adjectives is in the standard pattern. \"gray\" is an adjective of quality and comes before \"walking\" (a verb). \"Mexican\" is an article and comes after \"gray\".

In option A, the adjectives are \"cloth,\" \"smoking,\" and \"rectangular.\" In option B, the adjectives are \"rectangular,\" \"cloth,\" and \"smoking.\"\n\nIn English grammar, the usual order of adjectives is opinion-size-shape-age-color-origin.

Adjectives in English are typically ordered according to a specific set of rules. These rules determine the order in which the adjectives appear in a sentence.\n\n1. The first rule states that adjectives that describe something inherent to the noun come before adjectives that describe something external to it.

The second rule states that adjectives that describe something subjective, such as opinions or qualities, come before adjectives that describe something objective, such as physical characteristics. For example, \"a beautiful old house\" rather than \"an old beautiful house.\"\n\n3. The third rule states that adjectives that describe something more specific come before adjectives that describe something more general. For example, \"a small red house\" rather than \"a red small house.\"\n\n4. Finally, the fourth rule states that adjectives that describe something more likely to change come before adjectives that describe something less likely to change.
