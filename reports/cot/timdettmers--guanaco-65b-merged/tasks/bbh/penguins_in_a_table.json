To answer this question, we need to decide which penguins in the table meet both criteria: age greater than 5 years and weight greater than 12 kg.\n\n5. We can start by comparing the ages of the penguins to 5 years. Gwen is 8 years old, so she meets the age criterion. Louis is 7 years old, so he does not meet the age criterion. Vincent is 9 years old, so he meets the age criterion. Bernard is 5 years old, so he does not meet the age criterion. James is 12 years old, so he meets the age criterion.\n\n6.
