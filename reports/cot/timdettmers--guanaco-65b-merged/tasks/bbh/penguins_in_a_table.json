In step 1, we create two empty lists to store the ages of the giraffes and the penguins.\n2. In step 2, we use the information in the giraffe table to populate the age_giraffes list. There are four giraffes in the table, and their ages are 5, 10, 2, and 9. We can add these ages to the age_giraffes list.\n3. In step 3, we use the information in the penguin table to populate the age_penguins list. There are four penguins in the table, and their ages are 7, 5, 9, and 8. We can add these ages to the age_penguins list.\n4. In step 4, we use a list comprehension to count the number of ages in the age_giraffes list that are more than 5 years old. The ages 5, 10, 2, and 9 are greater than 5, so we get a total of 3.\n5. In step 5, we use another list comprehension to count the number of ages in the age_penguins list that are more than 5 years old. The ages 7, 5, 9, and 8 are not greater than 5, so we get a total of 0.\n6. In step 6, we add the totals from steps 4 and 5 to get the final answer. The total is 3 + 0, which is 3.

Let's start by looking at the table:\n\n| name | age | height (cm) | weight (kg) |\n| ---: | ---: | :----------- | :----------- |\n| Louis | 7 | 50 | 11 |\n| Bernard | 5 | 80 | 13 |\n| Vincent | 9 | 60 | 11 |\n| Gwen | 8 | 70 | 15 |\n\nThe table shows us information about four different penguins, so the answer is (E) 5.\n\nBut let's go through it step-by-step:\n\nI count the number of rows in the table. There are four rows, so I feel confident that there are 4 penguins.\n```\nSo far, I think the answer might be (B) 2, but I need to review my work.\n```\n\nI check the first row again to make sure I didn't miss any information. Louis is the only penguin in the first row, so the answer isn't (A) 1.\n\n```\nSo far, I think the answer might be (B) 2, but I need to review my work.\n```\n\nI check the second row. Both Bernard and Gwen are listed in the second row, so the answer is not (B) 2.\n\n```\nSo far, I think the answer is (C) 3, but I need to review my work.\n```\n\nI check the fourth row. Gwen is the only penguin in the fourth row, so the answer is not (A) 1.\n\n```\nSo far, I think the answer is (B) 2, but I need to review my work.\n```\n\nI check the third row. Vincent is listed in the third row, so the answer is not (B) 2.\n\n```\nSo far, I think the answer is (C) 3, but I need to review my work.\n```\n\nI check the first three rows again. I notice that there is no pattern to the information in each row. The rows don't have any relationship to each other, so I realize that I need to count the unique values instead of the rows.\n\n```\nSo far, I think the answer is (D) 4, but I need to review my work.\n```\n\nI count the unique penguin names. There are four unique names: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen. So, I feel confident that the answer is (E) 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) 4.\n\nSo the final line is: (E) 4.
