In contrast, BERT is trained for 3\u201410 days on a 32K-hour dataset of books [Table 3 on page 9](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/58af/34e0fbfbd58d986c40fe41ad9313a060ed1p7.pdf#page=9), an order of magnitude smaller.\n\nTherefore: Statement 1 is True.\n\nStatement 2: In 2018, Microsoft introduced their ResNets Inception family that uses global average pooling [Table 1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07261.pdf#page=2) and biases-and-variances normalization [Section 3.5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07261.pdf#page=8).\n\nResNets Inception family is a group of convolutional neural networks, and nowadays modern architectures follow this paradigm.

Support vector machines (SVMs) use a linear model to separate samples into different classes, and they output a probability distribution over the possible classes for each input example. This is similar to how logistic regression models output a probability value for each class.\n\n2. Statement 2 is false. The support vectors are the samples that lie closest to the decision boundary of the SVM model. As the kernel becomes more complex (e.g., going from a linear kernel to a polynomial kernel), the shape of the decision boundary changes, and the support vectors may no longer be the same.

            "model_answer": "My reasoning:\n\nFor Statement 1, the expectation maximization algorithm is an iterative algorithm used to find maximum likelihood estimates for parameters in a statistical model. The algorithm starts with an initial guess for the parameters, and then iterates between two steps: expectation and maximization. In the expectation step, the algorithm uses the current estimates for the parameters to calculate the expected value of the log-likelihood function for the data, given the current estimates. In the maximization step, the algorithm finds the parameters that maximize this expected log-likelihood function.\n\nIt is true that the log-likelihood function will always increase through successive iterations of the expectation maximization algorithm. This is because the algorithm is designed to find the parameters that maximize the log-likelihood function, and each iteration brings the parameter estimates closer to the optimal values. However, it is important to note that the log-likelihood function may not converge to the global maximum after a finite number of iterations.\n\nFor Statement 2, Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a Q-table to store the expected future rewards for each state-action pair. The algorithm starts with an initial Q-table, and then updates the Q-values based on experiences. The Q-values are updated according to the Bellman equation, which states that the Q-value of a state-action pair should be updated based on the current Q-value and the reward and next state obtained after taking that action.\n\nIt is true that Q-learning does not require prior knowledge of how actions affect the environment. In fact, one of the advantages of Q-learning is that it can learn the optimal actions to take in an environment without needing any prior knowledge of the environment's dynamics.\n\nHowever, it is false that Q-learning can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment. While it is true that Q-learning can learn the optimal actions to take in an environment without needing prior knowledge, it is also possible to use Q-learning when the learner has some knowledge of the environment. In fact, in many applications, the learner may have some knowledge of the environment, and this knowledge can be useful for improving the performance of Q-learning.\n\nBased on our reasoning, the answer is (B) False, False.\n\n(D)",

In this case, we have a gradient vector g which contains the partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to all the parameters in our model.\n\nTo compute the cost of one gradient descent update, we need to take a step in the direction opposite to the gradient, which can be done using the following update rule:\n\n`theta += -alpha * g`\n\nwhere `theta` is the vector of all parameters in our model, `g` is the gradient vector, and `alpha` is the learning rate.\n\nWe can see that the cost of computing this update is determined by the number of parameters in our model, which is given by `D`.

The algorithm chooses the attribute with the highest information gain to split the data, and continues this process until all subsets are homogeneous.

A model with low variance makes predictions that are closer to the actual values, but may not be very accurate.\n\n- Bias: Bias refers to the systematic error in a model's predictions.
