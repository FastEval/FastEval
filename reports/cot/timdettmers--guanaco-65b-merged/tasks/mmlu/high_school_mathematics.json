            "model_answer": "First, let's grow the prompt a bit: \n\nIf a pentagon P with vertices at (\u2013 2, \u2013 4), (\u2013 4, 1), (\u20131, 4), (2, 4), and (3, 0) is reflected across the line y = x to get a new pentagon, P\u2019, then one of the vertices of P\u2019 is\n(A) (0, \u2013 3)\n(B) (4, 1)\n(C) (2, 2)\n(D) (\u2013 4, \u20132)\n\nIn this question, (y=x) means the line where y equals x.\n\nWe can observe that point (\u20134, 1) lands on the line y=x, and that it does not line up with a point on either side of it. So, we can ignore the transformation, as it does not affect any points. \n\nThe next point to visit (\u20131, 4) lies above the line (y=x), so we need to reflect it down. \n\nWe can find the line's reflection by using the formula:\nX' = 2X - Y, where point (X,Y) on the line reflects to point (X', Y').\n\nSo, the reflection of point (\u20131, 4) is: (\u20131, 4)' = 2(\u20131) - 4 = (\u20132, \u20134). \n\nNow, we can add the transformed point to the transformed coordinate list: (\u20132,\u20134), (\u20134, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0).\n\nSo:\nthe first point (A) land's on (0, \u20133), we need to multiply by(-1) to adjust it for reflection. (The final coordinate wins, in the case of a tie), so the answer becomes (-1 * 0), which is (0, \u20133),\nthe second point (B) land's on (4, 1), we need to multiply by(-1) to adjust it for reflection. (Negative wins, in the case of a tie), so the answer becomes (-1 * 4), which is (-4, -1),\nthe third point (C) land's on (2, -2), we need to multiply by(-1) to adjust it for reflection. (The final coordinate wins, in the case of a tie), so the answer becomes (-1 * -2), which is (2, 2),\nthe last point (D) land's on (\u20134, 2), we need to multiply by(-1) to adjust it for reflection. (Positive wins, in the case of a tie), so the answer becomes (\u20131 * \u20134), which is (4, -4).\n\nWe can now see that point (2, 2) is reflected to the line y=x. \n\nFor point (C) (2,2) to be the only one of the four points on the line y=x, all the other answer possibilities have to be off the line y=x.\n\nPoint (A) (0, \u20133) is inside the square,\npoint (B) (-4, -1) is slightly below the line y=x, and flunks the first test.\npoint (D) (4, -4) is below the line y=x, and flunks the first test.\n\nAccording to correctly applied logic, (C) (2,2) must be the answer. \n\nThe final answer is C",

I can solve mathematical problems step-by-step.\n\nTo find the area of a rectangle, we need to know its length and width. In this problem, we are given that the length of the diagonal is 5\u221a5.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length and width of the rectangle. Since the length is twice the width, we can express the length and width in terms of some unknown variable:\n\nLength = 2x\nWidth = x\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the relationship between the diagonal length and the length and width of the rectangle:\n5\u221a5 = (2x)^2 + x^2 \n5\u221a5 = 4x^2 + x^2 \n5\u221a5 - x^2 = 4x^2 \n(5\u221a5 - 4)x^2 = 5\u221a5 - 4\nx^2 = (5\u221a5 - 4) / (5\u221a5 - 4)\nx = \u221a((5\u221a5 - 4) / (5\u221a5 - 4))\nx = \u221a(1)\nx = 1\nThis means that the length of the rectangle is 2, and the width is 1.\n\nNext, we can find the area of the rectangle using the formula:\nArea = Length x Width\nArea = (2 x 1)\nArea = 2\n\nFinally, the answer to the question is (A) 2500. 2500 is the correct answer.",

The prime factors of 392 are 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, and 7. We need to check if all of these primes have a square that is also a factor of 392.\n* 2^2 = 4 is a factor of 392, so we can check that off the list.\n* 3^2 = 9 is a factor of 392, so that's good as well.\n* 7^2 = 49 is not a factor of 392, so 392 is not powerful.\n\nNext, let's look at option (B) - 336. The prime factors of 336 are 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, and 7. Again, we need to check if all of these primes have a square that is also a factor of 336.\n* 2^2 = 4 is a factor of 336, so we can check that off the list.\n* 3^2 = 9 is a factor of 336, so that's good as well.\n* 7^2 = 49 is not a factor of 336, so 336 is not powerful.\n\nNow, let's look at option (C) - 300.

At breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Joe randomly chooses with equal probabilities either an apple, an orange, or a banana to eat.\n\nIn other words, there are three options for Joe to choose from at each meal, and the probability of choosing any of those options is the same (33%). \n\n2. What is the probability that Joe will eat at least two different kinds of fruit?\n\nWe want to find the probability that Joe will choose at least one fruit that is different than the other two.\n\nNow let's go through the possible outcomes for each meal:\n\nBreakfast:\n\nFirst, we can assume that Joe will choose an apple with a probability of 33%, an orange with a probability of 33%, or a banana with a probability of 33%.\n\nNow let's look at the possible outcomes for lunch:\n\nIf Joe chose an apple for breakfast, he can either choose an orange or a banana for lunch, but not another apple. So the probability of choosing a different fruit for lunch is 2/3.\n\nIf Joe chose an orange for breakfast, he can either choose an apple or a banana for lunch, but not another orange. So the probability of choosing a different fruit for lunch is also 2/3.\n\nAnd if Joe chose a banana for breakfast, he can either choose an apple or an orange for lunch, but not another banana. So the probability of choosing a different fruit for lunch is also 2/3.\n\nSimilarly, for dinner, we can assume that Joe will choose an apple with a probability of 33%, an orange with a probability of 33%, or a banana with a probability of 33%.\n\nNow let's look at the possible outcomes for dinner:\n\nIf Joe chose an apple for lunch, he can either choose an orange or a banana for dinner, but not another apple.

So the probability of choosing a different fruit for dinner is also 2/3.\n\nAnd if Joe chose a banana for lunch, he can either choose an apple or an orange for dinner, but not another banana. So the probability of choosing a different fruit for dinner is also 2/3.\n\nNow let's compare these possible outcomes to see which one gives us the highest probability:\n\nBreakfast: Apple - Probability of choosing a different fruit for lunch is 2/3\nBreakfast: Orange - Probability of choosing a different fruit for lunch is 2/3\nBreakfast: Banana - Probability of choosing a different fruit for lunch is 2/3\n\nLunch: Apple - Probability of choosing a different fruit for dinner is 2/3\nLunch: Orange - Probability of choosing a different fruit for dinner is 2/3\nLunch: Banana - Probability of choosing a different fruit for dinner is 2/3\n\nDinner: Apple - Probability of choosing a different fruit for dinner is 2/3\nDinner: Orange - Probability of choosing a different fruit for dinner is 2/3\nDinner: Banana - Probability of choosing a different fruit for dinner is 2/3\n\nIn all of these cases, the probability of choosing a different fruit for the next meal is always 2/3. Therefore, the overall probability of choosing at least two different fruits is (2/3)^3, or 8/9.\n\n(A) \\textbf{(A)} \\frac{7}{9}\n(B) \\frac{8}{9}\n(C) \\frac{5}{9}\n(D) \\frac{9}{11}",

The probability of rain and sun, given the meteorologist's report, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:\nP(rain and sun | meteorologist report) = P(meteorologist report | rain and sun) * P(rain and sun) / P(meteorologist report)\n\nFirst, let's plug in the given information. We're given that P(rain | meteorologist report) = 0.3 and P(no rain | meteorologist report) = 0.7. We can assume that the meteorologist report is equally likely to occur whether it is sunny or not, so P(meteorologist report | sun) = P(meteorologist report | no sun) = 1/2. Finally, we're given that P(sun) = 0.4 and P(no sun) = 0.6.\nNow we can calculate each of the terms in Bayes' theorem:\n\n1. P(meteorologist report | rain and sun)\nWe can calculate this using Bayes' theorem again:\nP(meteorologist report | rain and sun) = P(rain and sun | meteorologist report) * P(meteorologist report) / P(rain and sun)\nWe're given that P(rain and sun) = 0.4, and P(meteorologist report) is some number between 0 and 1 that we don't know. However, we can calculate it using the law of total probability:\nP(meteorologist report) = P(meteorologist report | sun) * P(sun) + P(meteorologist report | no sun) * P(no sun)\nWe know that P(meteorologist report | sun) = 1/2 and P(sun) = 0.4, and P(meteorologist report | no sun) = 0.7. Plugging these values in, we get:\nP(meteorologist report) = (1/2) * 0.4 + (0.7) * (0.6) = 0.5\nTherefore, P(meteorologist report | rain and sun) = (0.3) * (0.5) / (0.4) = 0.375\n\n2. P(rain and sun)\nWe're given that P(rain and sun) = 0.4.\n\n3. P(meteorologist report)\nWe already calculated that P(meteorologist report) = 0.5.\n\nNow we can plug in these values into Bayes' theorem:\nP(rain and sun | meteorologist report) = (0.375 * 0.4) / (0.5) = 0.26\n\nTherefore, the probability of rain and sun given the meteorologist's report is 0.26.\n\nSo the final answer with a single letter with parenthesis is (C) 0.24",

So there are 5^5 = 3125 possible outcomes in this case.\n- if we get 1 roll with a 6, then we have 4 rolls with a number from 1 to 5 and 1 with a 6. So there are 5^4 = 625 possible outcomes in this case.\n- if we get 2 rolls with a 6, then we have 3 rolls with a number from 1 to 5 and 2 with a 6.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Sure, here is my step-by-step reasoning:\n\nWe need to find the number of ways to select 4 odd integers from the sequence of consecutive integers 1, 2, 3, ..., 240 such that their sum is 240. We can start by choosing the largest integer and then determine the other three from the remaining integers.\n\nLet's start by choosing 120 for the largest integer. This leaves us with 120, 118, ..., 30 to choose from for the remaining three integers. We need to add up these three integers to get 6 (240 - 120). The only combination that adds up to 6 is 118 + 117 + 2 + 1 = 6. So, there is only one arithmetic sequence of consecutive odd integers that sums to 240 when the largest integer is 120 (120, 118, 1, 2).\n\nNow, let's try choosing 119 for the largest integer. This leaves us with 119, 117, ..., 31 to choose from for the remaining three integers. We need to add up these three integers to get 5 (240 - 119). The combinations of three consecutive odd integers that add up to 5 are (117, 115, 3, 1) and (117, 115, 5). So, there are two arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240 when the largest integer is 119.\n\nNext, let's try choosing 118 for the largest integer. This leaves us with 118, 116, ..., 30 to choose from for the remaining three integers. We need to add up these three integers to get 4 (240 - 118). The combinations of three consecutive odd integers that add up to 4 are (116, 114, 3, 1) and (116, 114, 5). So, there are two arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240 when the largest integer is 118.\n\nFinally, let's try choosing 117 for the largest integer. This leaves us with 117, 115, ..., 31 to choose from for the remaining three integers. We need to add up these three integers to get 3 (240 - 117). The only combination of three consecutive odd integers that adds up to 3 is (115, 113, 3). So, there is only one arithmetic sequence of consecutive odd integers that sums to 240 when the largest integer is 117.\n\nTo summarize, there is only one sequence when the largest integer is 120 (120, 118, 1, 2), two sequences when the largest integer is 119 (119, 117, 3, 1) and (119, 117, 5), two sequences when the largest integer is 118 (118, 116, 3, 1) and (118, 116, 5), and one sequence when the largest integer is 117 (117, 115, 3).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 12.",
