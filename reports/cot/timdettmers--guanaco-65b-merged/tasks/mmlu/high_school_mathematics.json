First, I need to figure out which of the vertices of the pentagon P would be reflection of  the other side of the line y = x.\n2. It looks like the vertex (\u2013 2, \u2013 4) is the only one that is on the correct side of the line y = x, so that will be the vertex that gets reflected.\n3. To find the reflection of this vertex, I need to flip the x and y coordinates. So the reflected vertex will have an x-coordinate of 2 and a y-coordinate of -4. This gives us the point (2, -4).\n4. Now, I need to check if this point is one of the vertices of P'. The options are (0, -3), (4, 1), (2, 2), and (-4, -2).\n5. I can quickly eliminate options (0, -3) and (2, 2) because they have different x- and y-coordinates from (2, -4).\n6. That leaves us with options (4, 1) and (-4, -2).\n7. To decide between these two options, I need to check which one has the same absolute value for both the x and y coordinates as our reflected vertex (2, -4).\n8. I can see that (-4, -2) has different absolute values for the x and y coordinates, while (4, 1) has the same absolute values (4 and 1).\n9. So, the correct option for the vertex of P' is (4, 1).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n(B) (4, 1)",

            "model_answer": "All right, let's approach this problem systematically.\n\nTo start with, the length and width relation can be represented in a simpler way, by saying that the length is 2 times the width, or that the width is half of the length:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0length = 2 * width\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0width = length / 2\n\nWe are also given that the length of the diagonal is 5 * sqrt(5). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the relationship between the length and the diagonal:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0d^2 = l^2 + w^2\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and d is the diagonal.\n\nSubstituting our length-width relationship into the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0d^2 = (2 * w)^2 + w^2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0d^2 = 4w^2 + w^2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0d^2 = 5w^2\n\nDividing both sides by d^2, we get:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0d = sqrt(5 * w^2) = 5 * sqrt(w^2) = 5 * w\n\nWe can now plug in this value for d into the length-width relationship and solve for the length:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0length = 2 * width = 2 * (d / 5) = 2 / 5 * d = 2 / 5 * 5 * w = 2 * w\n\nSo, we have now found the length and the width in terms of each other. We can substitute whichever one we want into the area formula:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Area = length * width = 2 * w * w = 2 * w^2\n\nSo, we have now found the area in terms of w. We can substitute in the Pythagorean theorem relation we found earlier, namely, w^2 = (d^2 - l^2) / 4, and solve for w:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0w^2 = (5 * sqrt(5)^2 - 2 * 2 * sqrt(5)^2) / 4 = 25 - 20 / 4 = 5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0w = sqrt(5)\n\nSo, we finally have the area in terms of our original given diagonal value:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Area = 2 * sqrt(5)^2 = 2 * 5 = 10\n\nThe answer is (A) 2500.\n\n(A)",

Since the only prime factor of 297 does not have a squared factor, it is not a powerful number.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the answer is (C) 300.\n\nThe final letter would be C.",

            "model_answer": "Alright, here's my reasoning:\n\n1. We need to find the number of arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240.\n\n2. The first odd integer in an arithmetic sequence will be 1, since the only way to make a sequence add up to 240 is to start with a small number and increase by a certain amount.\n\n3. The last integer in the sequence will have to be 240 / (2n - 1), where n is the number of odd integers in the sequence. This is because we need to divide 240 by the difference between consecutive terms (2n - 1) to get the last term. For example, if n=3, the last term will be 240 / (2(3) - 1) = 240 / 5 = 48.\n\n4. We can see that the last integer must be even, since it's a product of two integers (2n - 1) and 120. So the number of odd integers in the sequence must be odd, since we're starting with 1 and ending with an even number.\n\n5. Now we need to find the number of odd integers between 1 and 240 / (2n - 1). We can do this using a simple counting method:\n\nif 240 / (2n - 1) is odd, there will be (240 / (2n - 1) - 1) / 2 odd integers.\nif 240 / (2n - 1) is even, there will be (240 / (2n - 1) / 2) + 1 odd integers.\n\n6. So, for any n, we need to find the number of odd integers between 1 and 240 / (2n - 1), using the formula mentioned above. Let's start with n=1:\n\nwhen n=1, 240 / (2n - 1) = 240 / (2(1) - 1) = 240 / 1 = 240, which is even. So we have (240 / 2) + 1 = 121 odd integers between 1 and 240.\n\n7. Now, let's consider n=3:\n\nwhen n=3, 240 / (2n - 1) = 240 / (2(3) - 1) = 240 / 5 = 48, which is even. So we have (48 / 2) + 1 = 25 odd integers between 1 and 240.\n\n8. Let's try n=5:\n\nwhen n=5, 240 / (2n - 1) = 240 / (2(5) - 1) = 240 / 9 = 26, which is odd. So we have (26 - 1) / 2 = 12 odd integers between 1 and 240.\n\n9. Finally, let's consider n=7:\n\nwhen n=7, 240 / (2n - 1) = 240 / (2(7) - 1) = 240 / 13 = 18.46, which is not an integer. So we can't have a sequence of 7 odd integers that sums to 240.\n\n10. From our calculations, we see that:\n\nwhen n=1, we have 121 odd integers, which is greater than 240.\nwhen n=3, we have 25 odd integers, which is less than 240.\nwhen n=5, we have 12 odd integers, which is less than 240.\nwhen n=7, we can't have a sequence of 7 odd integers that sums to 240.\n\n11.
