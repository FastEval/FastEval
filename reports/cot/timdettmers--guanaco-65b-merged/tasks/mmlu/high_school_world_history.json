            "model_answer": "1. The first step is to understand the context of the quote. The quote is from Indonesian leader Sukarno, who delivered the keynote address at the Bandung Conference in 1955. The Bandung Conference was a meeting of Asian and African nations, who came together to forge bonds and work towards political and economic independence from colonial powers.\n\n2. The next step is to assess the content of the quote. Sukarno's words emphasize the importance of peace and the role of Asian and African nations in promoting it. He notes that without peace, their independence will be meaningless and their revolutions will not be able to progress. He calls on the assembled nations to work together and use their combined moral and political power to promote peace on the world stage.\n\n3. Based on this context and content, it is clear that the quote is most closely associated with the formation of the non-aligned movement (option A). The non-aligned movement emerged out of the Bandung Conference and was founded on the principles of peace, independence, and cooperation among developing nations. The movement's goal was to create a middle ground between the Cold War superpowers (the United States and the Soviet Union) and promote peace and development through negotiation and diplomacy.\n\n4. Options B, C, and D are not directly connected to the Bandung Conference or the non-aligned movement. Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation (option B) were not central themes of the Bandung Conference, although they were addressed in later meetings of the non-aligned movement. The Green Revolution (option C) was a movement in agriculture that emerged in the 1960s and aimed to increase food production through the use of new technologies and methods. Although it was related to development and poverty reduction, it was not directly linked to the Bandung Conference or the non-aligned movement. Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology (option D) was not a significant theme of the Bandung Conference or the non-aligned movement, which were based on a broader vision of international cooperation among developing nations, not just Asian nations.",

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

            "model_answer": "Sure! Here is my step-by-step reasoning for this question:\n\n1. The passage is about the development of gunpowder weapons in both Europe and China, and how their different military needs shaped the direction of their technology development.\n\n2. The key difference between Europe and China was the type of threats they faced - Europe had to deal with sieges, while China faced highly mobile steppe nomads.\n\n3. The passage mentions that early gunpowder weapons were unwieldy and not useful against nomads, so China focused on improving their horse archer units instead.\n\n4. European governments, on the other hand, saw the potential of gunpowder weapons and invested in research that led to more powerful and mobile weapons.\n\n5. The large-scale question that this passage most closely relates to is: Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.\n\n6. This is because European governments' investment in gunpowder weapons led to the development of more advanced weapons, which gave them a military advantage over other countries that did not have access to these weapons.\n\n7. None of the other answer choices relate to the main point of the passage - they are either not related to the development of gunpowder weapons, or they do not address the question of military superiority.\n\nTherefore, the best answer to the question is (B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.\n\n(B)",

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

The passage states that the people in the king's court wore silk robes, which suggests that silk was available to them.\n1. Since silk was historically native to China, this suggests that Ghana was engaged in trade with Asia, particularly China.\n1. However, the passage does not specifically mention trade with Asia, so we need to consider other evidence.\n1. The passage states that the king wore jewels and adorned himself with gold, which could have possibly come from India.\n1. However, there is no mention of India or Indian trade in the passage, and it is unlikely that the jewels or gold would have come directly from India.\n1. The passage does not mention the kow-tow or any other Chinese traditions, so there is no evidence to support Option B.\n1. Similarly, the passage does not mention anything about the Mongols or horses, so there is no evidence to support Option A.\n\nBased on these observations, I concluded that the best answer is (D) - The people in his court wore silk robes. This is the only piece of evidence in the passage that directly supports the idea that Ghana was engaged in trade with Asia, specifically with China through the Silk Road.\n\nThe answer is: D.\nIs there anything else I can help you with?",

            "model_answer": "Okay! It seems like your question is seeking an answer from the information given about Indonesian leader Sukarno's keynote address at the Bandung Conference in 1955.\n\nTo begin with, we should consider the context of the conference and Indonesia's position in the world at that time. The Bandung Conference was a meeting of representatives from 29 nations in Asia and Africa, who came together to discuss issues of colonialism, racism, and economic development.\n\nAt the time, Indonesia was a newly independent country, having gained its independence from the Netherlands in 1945. Sukarno, who was the president of Indonesia, was known for his strong vision of anti-colonialism and his efforts to promote international cooperation among developing countries.\n\nWithin the passage you have provided, Sukarno's emphasis on the importance of peace and the need for Asian and African countries to work together to promote peace is clear. He recognizes that peace is a necessary condition for the rebuilding of post-colonial societies and for the pursuit of independence and self-determination.\n\nThe options you have provided in the question all refer to significant geopolitical conflicts that occurred in the decades following the Bandung Conference. Of these options, the Cold War seems to be the most relevant to Sukarno's concerns about peace.\n\nIn the post-World War II era, the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union had a significant impact on global politics. This included the creation of competing military alliances, proxy wars, and economic and diplomatic rivalries between the two superpowers and their respective allies.\n\nIndonesia, as a developing country and a regional power in Southeast Asia, was caught in the middle of the Cold War. Sukarno sought to maintain a neutral stance in international affairs and to promote peace and cooperation among nations.\n\nHowever, Indonesia's position was complicated by the fact that it had its own internal conflicts, such as a communist insurgency, and by the influence of the United States, which was a major player in the region.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, the answer to your question is (A). The Cold War was a major geopolitical conflict that posed a significant threat to peace in the post-World War II era. Indonesia, under Sukarno's leadership, attempted to maintain a neutral stance in this conflict, but did not completely succeed in doing so.\n\nThis was partly due to the complex challenges facing Indonesia as a newly independent nation, as well as the influence of external powers such as the United States. (A) is the most correct answer, because it relates specifically to the Cold War and the challenges it posed to the pursuit of peace.",

He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The first passage is a quote from Olympe de Gouges' \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen\" from 1791. In this passage, she is encouraging women to stand up for their rights and to challenge the discrimination they face. The passage argues that the French Revolution has not done enough to advance women's rights, and that women need to take action to achieve equality.\n\nBased on this passage, we can say that Observation A is the best supported option. The passage suggests that while the French Revolution was progressive in some ways, it did not adequately address issues of gender equality. This is consistent with what we know about the role of women in the French Revolution, which was largely limited to supporting male revolutionaries rather than playing a direct role in the fighting or decision-making. \n\nOption B suggests that women typically assume leadership roles during times of revolution, but this is not supported by the passage. In fact, de Gouges' own experience as a revolutionary activist was unusual for her time, and she was one of only a few women who played a prominent role in the French Revolution. \n\nOption C suggests that women rarely support revolutions and therefore receive little benefit from them, but the passage does not address this idea. In fact, de Gouges was a supporter of the Revolution, and she believed that it could lead to greater rights for women. \n\nOption D suggests that revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights, but again, this is not supported by the passage. The passage suggests that the Revolution has not done enough for women, but that does not mean that it was completely uninterested in their rights.\n\nOverall, Observation A is the best supported option. The first passage suggests that the French Revolution did not do enough to advance women's rights, and that this is a sign of the revolutionary movement's lack of concern for gender equality.

A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it.

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.
