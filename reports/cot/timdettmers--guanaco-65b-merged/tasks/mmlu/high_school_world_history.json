            "model_answer": "Alright, I will provide a step-by-step explanation of how I reached the answer.\n\nIndonesian leader Sukarno is speaking about the importance of preserving peace in the world, and the need for Asian and African countries to work together to achieve this goal. He is specifically referring to the idea of forming a coalition of non-aligned nations, which would not be aligned with any of the major world powers of the time, such as the United States or the Soviet Union. He is calling for these non-aligned nations to work together to promote peace and stability in the world.\n\nThe passage also refers to the rehabilitation and upbuilding of countries that have recently gained their independence, which suggests that this speech was given at a time when many nations in Asia and Africa were gaining their independence from colonial rule. This time period would have been the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that the passage is most associated with the formation of the non-aligned movement. This movement was formed in the 1950s and 1960s, and was driven by the desire for newly independent nations in Asia and Africa to work together to promote peace and stability in the world. The non-aligned movement was a significant development in world politics, as it gave a voice to countries that were not aligned with any of the major powers, and provided an opportunity for these countries to work together to address global issues.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A).

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . .

            "model_answer": "Okay, I will explain my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The passage provides information about the city of Ghana, its people, and their traditions. It states that it had two towns, one inhabited by Muslims and the other by non-Muslims. Tambu is a market town located in Ghana.  It was the last commercial stop for easily transported items from the north like salt and modest amount of copper.  Merchants from Maghreb brokered resources from trans-saharan trade carriage, and in turn sold salt and other resources to traders from north Ghana \u2013 resulting in accrued wealth for the local rulers of Ghana.  Textiles, a highly valued commodity in recorded history, was always in a flow to central and west Africa from India.\n\n2. The passage mentions that the king adorned himself with gold and jewels, which could have been obtained from India through trade. Therefore, (C) is a possible answer.\n\n3. The passage also mentions that the people in his court wore silk robes, which could have been imported from Asia. Therefore, (D) is another possible answer.\n\n4. However, the passage does not mention anything about the Ghanian king adopting the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow (B), or the presence of horses in the court, which would have come from the Mongols (A). Therefore, these options can be eliminated.\n\n5. Based on the information in the passage, I would conclude that the most likely answer is (C) - The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India. This indicates that Ghanians were engaged in trade with India, which was part of Asia at the time.\n\nFinal answer: (C) The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.",

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea.

            "model_answer": "Sure! My first step is when I am given the question. Upon reviewing it, the events seem to revolve around colonization of Korea by foreign actors.\nThe second step I would do is group the events described in the question and determine that it boils down to 3 major developments:\n- In the 1940s (referred to as Bonesteel's prime consideration), Russian troops were advancing into the Korean peninsula near the 38th parallel from the north after its defeat during World War 2. \n- During this same period (referred to as events deprived here for the Koreans), Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel because of the line of division established between the North and South (Russian advancement versus American occupied zone) \n- The US drafted a surrender agreement that would establish a zone of control between its space and that of the Soviets on the peninsula. This is my interpretation of the events from information given in the question.\nAfter that, I would determine that the events language to be mildly biased from the questioner \n- The consideration for Korea was only referred to last after the military consideration of other parties, leading me to believe this is from the POV of a foreign party (which is confirmed based on wording choice)\n- The surrender agreement was meant to prevent Soviet expansion in more favorable terms for the Americans \n- There was no mention of what the actual Koreans thought of this divide, until my follow up referenced the effects would be for the Koreans. \n- it's inferred the divide was not acceptable terms for the Koreas, as there were groups of Korean's that advocated for reunification.\nHence, these events would have a negative impact on Korean society, as they were detached from the determination of their nation's boundaries and, were not afforded opportunity to determine how to improve relations with their neighbors.\n\nHere's the series of steps I would take next:\n- I would determine the outline of my response as: (1) explain how the events deprived Koreans, (2) outline the effects of interventions by foreign actors.\n- So I would start my first paragraph, if faced with this inquiry. In the past, the Korean Peninsula was divided into two markets without the consent of the people. It led to the Korean people losing control of their country at first, which meant that peace negotiations between North and South Korea led to the establishment of two governments separately. This means that they never had the chance to develop their country together, which led to many economic problems in the long term.\n\nBased on this logic, the outcome of these events would most likely be C.  \n\nThe last answer is (C).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Alright, I will answer your question step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the quotes given:\n\nDickens's quote: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way\u2014in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only. There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal . . . that things in general were settled for ever. - A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens\"\n\nWordsworth's quote: Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. But to be young was very heaven. - The Prelude, by William Wordsworth\n\nNow, let's analyze these quotes:\n\nDickens's quote: The quote is very much a dichotomy, as indicated by the repeated phrase of \"it was the best of times, it was the worst of times\". It paints a picture of a time that was both hopeful (a spring of hope, the period being like heaven) and hopeless (a winter of despair, nothing before them). The mention of \"noisiest authorities\" and \"things . . . settled for ever\" suggest that Dickens viewed the French Revolution as a time of confusion and uncertainty, where change was unlikely.\n\nWordsworth's quote: Wordsworth's quote, on the other hand, is much more optimistic. He describes the dawn of the French Revolution as \"bliss\" and being young (as change can often be driven by the young) as \"very heaven\". The contrast between the two poems suggests that Wordsworth was more hopeful for the future, whereas Dickens viewed it as a time of stagnation.\n\nNow, let's answer the question:\nThe adjective that best describes Dickens's view is (C) Cynical. Dichotomies are often used to show cynicism, as they show how there can be two contradictory views of the same situation. Dickens's view of the French Revolution is one of cynicism, where he saw it as a time of uncertainty and little hope of change.\n\nThe adjective that best describes Wordsworth's view is (B) Understanding. Wordsworth's poem paints the French Revolution in a positive light, as a time of hope and change. He understands the emotions of those involved in the Revolution, and his poem is filled with empathy and optimism.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (C) Cynical, enthusiastic. Dickens's view of the French Revolution was cynical, while Wordsworth's view was enthusiastic.\n\nSo it would be (C) Cynical, enthusiastic for the question \"Dickens's and Wordsworth's differing views about the French Revolution can be described, respectively, by which of the following adjectives?\".",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to answer your question step-by-step. Let's get started:\n\n1. The first passage is a quote from Olympe de Gouges' \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" which was written in 1791 during the French Revolution.\n\nthis is the first step\n\n2. In this passage, de Gouges is making the case for why women should have the same rights as men, including the right to education, the right to own property, and the right to participate in politics.\n\nthis is the second step\n\n3. The passage makes it clear that de Gouges believes that women are currently being discriminated against and that this discrimination needs to be corrected.\n\nthis is third step\n\n4. Now, to answer your question, it seems that the best supported observation is (A): Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality.\n\nthis is the fourth step\n\n5. While de Gouges was pushing for gender equality during the French Revolution, it's clear that many of her fellow revolutionaries were not and that women's rights were not a top priority for the revolution as a whole.\n\nthis is the fifth step\n\n6. This is supported by the fact that, despite the efforts of a few women like de Gouges, women's rights did not see any significant improvement in France until much later, and even today, women still face discrimination in many areas of life.\n\nthis is the sixth step\n\n7. Option (B) is not supported because the first passage does not suggest that women typically assume leadership roles during times of revolution. In fact, de Gouges was a rare exception to the rule.\n\nthis is the seventh step\n\n8. Option (C) is not supported because the first passage does not specifically mention whether women support revolutions or not, and it certainly doesn't say that they rarely support them.\n\nthis is the eighth step\n\n9. Option (D) is not supported because the first passage does not suggest that revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights. In fact, the passage suggests that some revolutionaries, like de Gouges, were actively fighting for women's rights.\n\nthis is the ninth step\n\n10. So, in conclusion, the best supported observation about revolutions and gender, based on the first passage, is (A): Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality.\n\nthis is the tenth step\n\nHello, the answer is A",

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",

            "model_answer": "I'd be happy to answer your question. Here's my step-by-step breakdown:\n\n(1) Understanding the question:\nI understand that I'm being asked to choose between four options (A-D) and provide an explanation for my answer. I note that the question is asking me to consider the second passage and its implications.\n\n(2) Reviewing the relevant information:\nI begin by reviewing the second passage. Rudrangshu Mukherjee, the author, says that \"the right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly.\" He also says that this monopoly was broken when the colonized defeated the colonizers. Finally, he notes that the British treated the Indians as subhuman.\n\n(3) Analyzing the options:\nI consider each of the four options. Option (A) seems irrelevant, given that military norms don't seem to be the focus of the second passage. Option (C) doesn't seem justified by the passage, which doesn't praise violence. Option (D) doesn't seem compatible with the passage, which emphasizes the Indians' relative lack of power.\n8This leaves me with option (B), which seems like the best fit. The second passage suggests that the Cawnpore Massacre was a direct response to the systemic cruelty and oppression that the British inflicted on the Indians for so long. The passage doesn't glorify or condone violence, but it does seem to see it as an inevitable response to British colonialism.\n\n(4) Explaining my answer:\nI conclude that the massacre can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India, as suggested by option (B). The second passage emphasizes the Indians' lack of power and the British monopoly on violence, which creates a context for understanding the massacre as a response to oppression.\n\n(5) Providing the answer:\nTherefore, my final answer is option (B).\n\n(6) Final answer:\n(B)\n\nI hope this breakdown was helpful. I welcome any further questions or feedback!",
