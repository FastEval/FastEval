This statement is a supporting reason that helps to justify the premise.\n3. The following sentence \"Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\" (C) builds upon the previous statements and explains the consequences of the arrogance of consciousness blocking the unconscious complexes.

            "model_answer": "Alright, here's a step-by-step explanation of how to construct a truth table and determine whether the argument is valid or invalid:\n\n**Step 1: Construct the truth table**\n\nAssign the variables G and H truth values of T (true) or F (false). In this case, we'll use G for the first column and H for the second column.\n1. First, fill in the columns with the possible truth values assign to G and H:\n```BLOCK\nG\tH\tG or H\t~G\t(~G -> H)\t~H -> G\t~H or G\nT\tT\tT\tF\tT\tT\tT\tT\nT\tF\tT\tF\tT\tF\tF\tT\nF\tT\tT\tT\tF\tT\tT\tT\nF\tF\tF\tT\tF\tF\tT\tT\n```\n2. For each row, evaluate the expressions in parentheses one-by-one, from left to right:\n```\nG\t~G\tG or H\tH\t~H\t(~G -> H)\t(~H -> G)\t(~H or G)\nT\tF\tT\tT\tF\tT\tF\tF\nT\tF\tT\tF\tF\tT\tT\tT\nF\tT\tT\tT\tF\tT\tF\tF\nF\tT\tF\tF\tT\tF\tT\tT\n```\n3. For the final column, simply input the truth value that corresponds to the conclusion of the argument.\n1. The argument is ~G \u2283 H. This means that if ~G is true, then H must be true. So, we're looking for a row where ~G is T and H is T.\n2. In the third row of the truth table, ~G is T (because G is F) and H is T, which satisfies the conditions for the argument to be true.\n3. In all other rows, ~G is either F or H is F, which do not satisfy the conditions for the argument to be true.\n\n**Step 2: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid**\n\nNow that we have a truth table, we can determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n1. A valid argument is one where the conclusion logically follows from the premises, regardless of the truth values assigned to the variables.\n2. An argument is said to be invalid if it is possible to assign truth values to the variables that make the premises all true and the conclusion false.\n3. To determine whether the argument is valid or invalid, we must check all rows of the truth table. If there is a row where all premises are T and the conclusion is F, then the argument is invalid.\nIn our case, the only row where all premises are T is the third row, where the conclusion is also T. This means that the argument is valid.\n\n**Synthesis**\nFrom these steps, we can conclude that the argument ~G \u2283 H is valid. There is no counterexample to the argument, because it is always true regardless of the truth values assigned to G and H.\n\nI hope this explanation was helpful!

G \u2283 F (If G is true, then F must be true.)\n3. H \u2228 ~E (H or the negation of E must be true.)\n4. H \u2283 I (If H is true, then I must be true.)\n5. ~I (I is false.)\n\nWe need to find the answer among the Ooptions (A) to (D):\n\n(A) E \u2283 F\n(B) F \u2283 G\n(C) H \u2283 ~E\n(D) ~H\n\nWe can use the method of truth tables to verify the propositions. A truth table is a table used in logic to show the possible truth values of a compound proposition based on the truth values of its simple propositions.\n\nLet's start with option (A):\n\nFrom the premises, we can see that E and F are related, and our goal is to find a one-step consequence of the given premises.
