            "model_answer": "1. First, let's divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get:\n\n24/2 = p\n12 = p\n\n2. We know that 12 is a composite number (it has factors other than 1 and itself), so let's factor it to see if we can find any potential values for p:\n\n12 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3\n\n3. We notice that one of the factors of 12 is 2, which is also on the left side of the equation. This leads us to believe that p may be a multiple of 2.\n\n4. Let's try some of the multiple options for p:\n\n(A) 4: 2 x 2\n(B) 6: 2 x 2 x 3\n(C) 8: 2 x 2 x 2\n(D) 12: 2 x 2 x 2 x 3\n\n5. After plugging each of these options back into the equation, we find that only one of them gives us an equal value on both sides of the equation:\n\n24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 (when p = 12)\n\n6. So, the final answer is:\n\n(D) p = 12",

The total cost for four tickets is $112. Write and solve an equation to find the cost of one ticket t.\n\nThe first step is to write down the equation:\n\n> 4t = 112\n\nThe right-hand side of the equation (112) represents the total cost of the four tickets. The left-hand side of the equation (4t) represents the cost of one ticket (t) times the number of tickets (4). Since the total cost is $112, we can replace the 112 on the right-hand side with 112.\n\nThe next step is to solve the equation to find the cost of one ticket (t):\n\n> 4t = 112\n> 4t/4 = 112/4\n> t = 28\n\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to get the cost of one ticket (t) on one side of the equation. The result of this step is the equation t = 28.\n\nTo find the final answer, we can substitute 28 back into the original equation:\n\n> 4t = 112\n> 4(28) = 112\n> 112 = 112\n\nThis shows that the cost of one ticket is $28.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n(D) t over 4 = 112; $28\n\n\nHere is the final line with parenthesis.\n\n(D) t over 4 = 112; $28",
