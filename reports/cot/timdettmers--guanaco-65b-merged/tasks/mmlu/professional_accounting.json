However, since the purchase of merchandise was not recorded, the company's assets would be understated. This is because the merchandise was not included in Arno's accounting records, and therefore, its value was not reflected on the balance sheet.\n\n### B: No effect\n\nSimilarly, if we select option (B), we would not make any adjustments to Arno's balance sheet. However, this time the company's liabilities would be understated. Arno's liabilities should have increased by the amount of the purchase, and this information was not included in Arno's records. So, by not recording the purchase, the company has understated its liabilities.\n\n### C: Understated\n\nIf we select option (C), we would need to increase Arno's assets to reflect the true value of its merchandise. By not recording the purchase of merchandise, Arno's assets were understated, so we need to adjust them upwards to accurately reflect the company's position.\n\n### D: Understated\n\nFinally, if we select option (D), we would need to increase Arno's liabilities to reflect the true amount owed by the company. In this case, both assets and liabilities would be understated, as the purchase of merchandise was not recorded.\n\nTo summarize, the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise has resulted in Arno's balance sheet being inaccurate.

            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we first need to understand what audit sampling risks are.\n\nAudit sampling is the process of selecting a representative portion of a larger population to assess the overall reliability of financial statements. Sampling is an efficient way to gather evidence, but it also comes with certain risks.\n\nThere are two main types of risks associated with audit sampling: sampling risk and nonsampling risk. Sampling risk occurs when the auditor draws conclusions based on a sample that is not truly representative of the entire population. Nonsampling risk, on the other hand, is the risk that the auditor will fail to detect material misstatements that exist in the population.\n\nNow, let's look at each of the statements in the question:\n\nStatements (A) and (D):\nBoth of these statements are related to sampling risk, which is the risk that the auditor will draw incorrect conclusions because of the sample selected.\n\nStatement (B):\nThis statement is related to nonsampling risk, which is the risk of failing to detect material misstatements that exist in the population.\n\nStatement (C):\nThis statement is not related to audit sampling risks at all, but rather to the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that statement (B) is the correct answer.\nSo my answer to the question is `(B)`",

Reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end = **D**\n4. Comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited = **A**\n\nMy step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Of the given procedures, only option **B** involves inspecting inventory items before the year end. The auditor would likely perform this procedure to ensure that the inventory count is accurate, which is a key aspect of internal control over financial reporting.\n2. Option **C** involves testing internal control activities, which is an important part of an auditor's responsibilities. By reviewing the client's bank statements for several months after the year end, the auditor can assess whether the client has implemented appropriate controls over cash transactions.\n3. Option **D** involves comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited. This procedure is not related to subsequent events, but rather to the auditor's responsibilities for issuing an opinion on the financial statements.\n4. Option **A** involves comparing the inventory count with the statement being audited. This procedure is relevant to subsequent events, as the auditor must consider any events that occur after the balance sheet date.\n\nFinal answer: **D**\n\n(Keep in mind that this is just one possible approach to the problem.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Alright, I'll be happy to answer this question for you step-by-step.\n\nTo start off, we need to calculate the future value of each of the cash flows. We can do this using the compound interest formula:\n\nFuture value = Present value * (1 + r)^n\n\nwhere r is the discount rate (10% in this case) and n is the number of years.\n\nSo for the first cash flow (at year 5), the future value is:\n\nFV5 = $500 * (1 + 0.1)^5 = $793.46\n\nAnd for the second cash flow (at year 10), the future value is:\n\nFV10 = $500 * (1 + 0.1)^10 = $700\n\nNow we need to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the project. The NPV is the difference between the present value of all cash flows and the initial investment. The present value of the cash flows can be calculated using the same compound interest formula, but this time we'll be solving for the present value:\n\nPV = Future value / (1 + r)^n\n\nFor the first cash flow, the present value is:\n\nPV5 = $793.46 / (1 + 0.1)^5 = $487.42\n\nAnd for the second cash flow, the present value is:\n\nPV10 = $700 / (1 + 0.1)^10 = $430.37\n\nThe initial investment is $500, so the NPV is:\n\nNPV = PV5 + PV10 - Initial investment\nNPV = $487.42 + $430.37 - $500\nNPV = -$2.31\n\nFinally, we can answer the question. The project's NPV is negative, so we can rule out options A and D. The remaining options are B and C. However, option C is only $3, which is much less than our calculated NPV of -$2.31. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.\n\nSo, to summarize, the project's NPV is:\n\n(B) \u2212$27\n\n( ($487.42 + $430.37) - $500 )",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "1. To determine how the bond carrying amount, retained earnings, and bond interest expense were affected by the error, we need to understand the concept of bond premium and the correct method for amortizing bond premium.\n\n    A bond premium occurs when a bond is issued above its face value, and it represents the excess of the proceeds received over the par value of the bond. In this case, the bond was issued at a premium of $100,000 (face value $100,000 * .10 premium rate).\n\n    To correctly account for bond premium, the effective interest method must be used. This method allocates the bond premium over the life of the bond in a way that prevents the premium from distorting the interest income recognized.\n\n    When the straight-line method is used instead of the effective interest method, the interest expense will be understated and the bond carrying amount will be overstated. With a bond premium, the interest expense should gradually decrease over the life of the bond, as the bond premium is amortized. However, the straight-line method spreads the premium evenly over the life of the bond, resulting in a constant interest expense.\n\n    The error in amortizing the bond premium will lead to retained earnings being understated. This is because the interest expense is understated, reducing the net income reported.\n\n2. Let's look at how the error affects the bond carrying amount, retained earnings, and bond interest expense at June 30 year 12:\n\n    Bond carrying amount: The straight-line method has overstated the bond carrying amount, as the bond has been amortized to an amount higher than its current market value. The correct answer is (B) Understated.\n\n    Bond retained earnings: The understated interest expense has resulted in retained earnings being understated, as the net income reported has been lower than it should be. The correct answer is (B) Understated.\n\n    Bond interest expense: The straight-line method has understated the bond interest expense, as the premium has not been amortized enough. The correct answer is (A) Overstated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) for both bond carrying amount and retained earnings, and (A) for bond interest expense.\n\n(B) Understated\n(A) Overstated\n\n(B) Understated",

            "model_answer": "Sure, let's go through this step-by-step. First, let's define some of the terms:\n- Face value: The amount of money that the bond issuer promises to pay the bondholder when the bond matures. In this case, it's $100.\n- Coupon rate: The annual interest rate on the bond, typically expressed as a percentage of the face value. In this case, it's 5%.\n- Yield: The total return an investor gets from a bond, taking into account both the coupon payments and any changes in the bond's price. In this case, it's 6%.\nNow, we can calculate the answer using the following steps:\n1. Calculate the annual coupon payments:\nSince the coupon rate is 5%, the annual coupon payment is $100 * 0.05 = $5.\n2. Calculate the bond's price:\nWe can use the yield formula to calculate the bond's price:\n$100 = ((C / Y) - 1) * 100\nWhere C is the annual coupon payment and Y is the yield.\nRearranging this formula gives us:\nC / Y - 1 = 100\n5 / 0.06 - 1 = 95.83\nSo the bond's price is $95.83.\n3. Check the answer choices:\nWe now need to compare our answer to the answer choices that were given:\n(A) $100: This is the face value of the bond, but we have already calculated the bond's price to be $95.83.
