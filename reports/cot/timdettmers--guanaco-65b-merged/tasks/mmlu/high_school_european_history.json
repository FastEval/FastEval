Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n\nFirst, I read the quotation you provided and note that Gibbon is describing the various modes of worship in the Roman world. He says that the people considered all these modes as equally true, the philosopher considered them all as equally false, and the magistrate considered them all as equally useful.\n\nSecond, I paraphrase Gibbon's interpretation of the state of religious worship in ancient Rome:\n\nGibbon is suggesting that in ancient Rome, religious worship was seen as a tool for social control by the magistrate.\n\nThird, I compare this paraphrase with the options you provided:\n\nA - In ancient Rome, religious worship was decentralized and tended to vary with one's social position. - This is not consistent with Gibbon's interpretation, as he does not mention anything about decentralization or social positions.\n\nB - In ancient Rome, religious worship was the source of much social tension and turmoil. - Again, this is not consistent with Gibbon's interpretation, as he does not suggest that religious worship was a cause of social tension or turmoil.\n\nC - In ancient Rome, religious worship was homogeneous and highly centralized. - This is closer to Gibbon's interpretation, but he does not specifically say that religious worship was homogeneous or highly centralized.\n\nD - In ancient Rome, religious worship was revolutionized by the introduction of Christianity. - This is not relevant to Gibbon's interpretation, as he is not discussing the introduction of Christianity.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that the best answer is C - In ancient Rome, religious worship was homogeneous and highly centralized. While this is not a perfect match to Gibbon's interpretation, it is closer to his description than the other options.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n(C) In ancient Rome, religious worship was homogeneous and highly centralized.",

Please note that the final answer is (D).\n\nTo start, let's look at the information given in the quote by Voltaire. In this quote, Voltaire is responding to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, which was one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. Voltaire is shocked by the devastation caused by the earthquake and questions how this could happen in a world that is supposed to be designed by a benevolent God.\n\nNext, let's consider the characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals as outlined in the question. (A) states that many Enlightenment intellectuals were accomplished scientists who added important pieces to human understanding of the universe. While this is true, it is not directly related to Voltaire's quote.\n\n(B) states that Enlightenment intellectuals utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets. Again, while this is true, it is not directly related to Voltaire's quote.\n\n(C) states that most Enlightenment intellectuals rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational man. While there were some Enlightenment intellectuals who rejected religion, Voltaire was not one of them. In his writings, he often questioned organized religion and its practices, but he did not reject religion altogether.\n\n(D) states that many Enlightenment intellectuals believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues. This is the best answer to the question, as it directly relates to Voltaire's quote. In the quote, Voltaire is questioning how a benevolent God could allow such devastation to happen, and he is calling for a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best answer to the question is (D).",

The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\n(A) De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n(C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n(D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.",
