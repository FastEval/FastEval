            "model_answer": "Alright, here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\nThe question mentions typical advertising regulatory bodies, so we can assume that the answer is related to advertising.\n\nThe question is asking for a word that completes each of the four blanks. Let's look at each blank individually:\n\nFor the first blank, we need a word that completes the phrase \"encourage unsafe practices\". The only option that makes sense here is \"Unsafe practices\".\n\nFor the second blank, we need a word that completes the phrase \"cause unnecessary wants or fear\". The word \"Wants\" doesn't make sense here, as it's not something that can be caused. The word \"Fear\" could work, but the other options also work.\n\nFor the third blank, we need a word that completes the phrase \"cause trivial offense\". The word \"Trivial\" doesn't make sense here, as it's not a type of offense. The other options work, but \"Serious\" is the better choice.\n\nFor the final blank, we need a word that completes the phrase \"cause serious offense\". The words \"Distress\" and \"Jealousy\" don't make sense here. The other options work, but \"Serious\" is the better choice.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best answer is (B).\n\n(A) is incorrect because \"Unsafe practices\" is correct for the first blank, but \"Wants\" doesn't work for the second blank.\n\n(C) is incorrect because \"Safe practices\" doesn't work for the first blank, and \"Trivial\" doesn't work for the third blank.\n\n(D) is incorrect because \"Safe practices\" works for the first blank, but \"Serious\" works better for the third and final blanks.\n\nSo the answer is (B).\n\nFinal answer: (B)",

Finally, \"work-play balance\" sounds like it could be related, but it is not a commonly used term compared to \"work-life balance\".\n\nBased on this analysis, my answer is (D) Work-life balance.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "My reasoning for the question you asked is as follows:\n\nFirst, I considered hedonistic utilitarianism, as it is a major normative theory. However, while corporate profit maximization can lead to happiness for some, it may not maximize overall happiness in society. In fact, it may lead to suffering for some individuals in order to maximize profits for others.\n\nNext, I considered preference utilitarianism, which holds that actions should maximize the satisfaction of preferences. However, corporate profit maximization is not necessarily aligned with the preferences of all stakeholders, and may prioritize the preferences of a few over the preferences of many.\n\nThen, I considered the Categorical Imperative, which states that one should act in a way that they would willingly universalize. However, it is difficult to see how corporate profit maximization would meet this standard, as it may lead to harm for some individuals or groups.\n\nFinally, I considered ethics of care, which prioritizes relationships and caring for others. While corporate profit maximization may result in benefits for some, it may not take into account the needs and concerns of all stakeholders, and may neglect relationships in favor of profits.\n\nBased on my reasoning, I would say that corporate profit maximization is most similar to hedonistic utilitarianism, but not directly prescribed by it.\n\nThe answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Alright! Here's my step-by-step explanation:\n\nThe question is asking what Milton Friedman believes to be the sole responsibility of business. To answer this question, we need to consider the options (A), (B), (C), and (D) provided.\n\nLet's start by looking at option (A). According to Milton Friedman, the only social responsibility of business is to increase profits for its shareholders. In his famous article \"The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits,\" Friedman argues that businesses have a responsibility to their shareholders and that this responsibility should take precedence over other social considerations.\n\nNow, let's look at option (B). According to this option, managers should act in ways that balance the interests of society and shareholders. However, Friedman would disagree with this view. He believed that businesses have a responsibility to their shareholders and that this responsibility should take priority over other social concerns.\n\nOption (C) suggests that the primary responsibility of organizations is to its employees. Again, Friedman would disagree with this view. He believed that the primary responsibility of businesses is to their shareholders, not to their employees.\n\nFinally, option (D) suggests that the primary responsibility of organizations is to its stakeholders. This is a broader view than the one espoused by Friedman, who believed that the only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer to the question is (A). Milton Friedman believed that the only social responsibility of business is to increase profits for its shareholders.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Sure thing, I will answer the question step-by-step.\n\nHere is my reasoning:\n1. The given options for the question are A, B, C, and D.\n1. Let's consider the first option, \"Dynamic\". The word means \"constantly changing or adapting\", which is suggesting that the working practices are not stable and can change any time. This does not clearly relate to the rephrased statement given in the question option, which suggests that the work patterns have certain fluidity or flexibility to them but are still structured to some degree.\n1. Next, let's consider the second option, \"Fluid\". The word means \"flowing or moving smoothly\", which is suggesting that the work practices have a smooth and uninterrupted flow to them. This relates to the rephrased statement given in the question option, which suggests that the work patterns have a fluidity or flexibility to them. Thus, option B is likely the correct answer.\n1. Now, let's consider the third option, \"Flexible\". The word means \"able to bend or change easily\", which is suggesting that the work practices can be modified or adjusted as needed. However, the question option does not specifically mention the ability to modify or adjust. Instead, it suggests a more general fluidity or flexibility to the work patterns. Thus, option C is less likely to be the correct answer.\n1. Finally, let's consider the fourth option, \"Modern\". The word means \"of or relating to the present or recent times\", which is not directly related to the rephrased statement in the question option. Thus, option D is not relevant to the question.\nTo sum up, option B, \"Fluid\", is the most likely answer, as it best relates to the statement in the question option.\n\nAnswer: B",
