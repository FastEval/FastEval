            "question": "Which of these principles is not an element of the responsibility to protect?\n\n(A) The responsibility to prevent.\n(B) The responsibility to react.\n(C) The responsibility to remain sovereign.\n(D) The responsibility to rebuild.",

            "model_answer": "1. The responsibility to prevent is the first principle listed. It is also an element of the responsibility to protect (R2P). The ability to prevent the four crimes outlined in the R2P Santos Republic Resolution, which are genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, determines the success of all other R2P pillars. \n2. The responsibility to react is the second principle. It is also an element of the R2P. The will and ability to take strong actions, which may include coercive measures such as economic sanctions or military intervention if necessary, is vital to defending those at risk of crimes outlined in the R2P. If the international community fails to react effectively, then the ability to prevent and rebuild will be severely undermined. \n3. The responsibility to remain sovereign is the third principle listed. While it is not explicitly an element of the R2P, there remain issues with the notion that states that are unable or unwilling to protect their own populations should be allowed to maintain unfettered sovereignty. By virtue of ratifying the principles of the UN Charter, states have implicitly agreed to accept responsibility for protecting their vital interests, including their populations. The R2P represents an extension of that principle. \n4. The responsibility to rebuild is the fourth principle listed. It is also an element of the R2P. Ending impunity for the perpetrators of R2P crimes, and addressing the issues that prompted their commission, requires the restoration of State institutions and broad-based inclusion in political decision-making. The rebuilding isaris often the most difficult and time-consuming aspects of the R2P, but is vital to sustaining the first two pillars.",

            "question": "Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\n\n(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal.

            "model_answer": "A) Environmental challenges to economic growth are an area that is a double edged sword. On the one hand, natural resource management, and employment are areas which may be affected, but on the other hand diversification and research into solving these issues. In the long term such research may put in motion changes which create technology which can be repurposed for military programs.\n\nB) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n\nC) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External military threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n\nD) All of these options are valid and McKinsey company's can work with countries to minimize their environmental impact. While balancing the other functions of government including national defense because, McKinsey is exactly that, a business which has as one of it's core principles the notion of being a trusted Partner and not a visible technology. McKinsey is a business like all businesses, not a government, and its focus is on solving the major problems that affect governments, other businesses, investors and other entities like banks and insurance companies and not the average citizen. Therefore these concerns are really external to the issues McKinsey is trying to solve for it's customers.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "model_answer": "Answer: D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.\n\nExplanation:\n\nOption A suggests that a liberal perspective on future energy security would be that all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which the energy market operates as a free market. However, there is no mention of \"liberal\" energy security. It seems to be more focused on security through interconnectedness and economic order.\n\nOption B highlights a worrying trend of energy scarcity leading to a \"new international energy order\" with less liberal free-market trading and more statism and neo-mercantilism. This perspective also fails to explicitly mention a \"liberal\" approach to energy security.\n\nOption C argues that oil remains the lifeblood of the current order, benefiting capitalist economic elites. It does not suggest how energy security should be achieved.\n\nFinally, option D states that energy scarcity will lead to geopolitical confrontation and possibly \"resource wars\" over energy sources. This perspective seems to be the only one that suggests a potential future that requires liberal energy security measures to be put in place to prevent conflicts over energy resources.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: (D) All of these options.\n\nExplanation of reasoning:\n\nOption A states that human security is neo-colonial. This argument suggests that human security is an attempt by wealthy nations to maintain their power and influence over less powerful nations. This is one potential critique of human security, as it implies that the concept could be used to justify interventions and policies that benefit powerful nations at the expense of weaker ones.\n\nOption B states that human security promotes global capitalism. This argument suggests that human security is a tool used by wealthy nations to promote their own economic interests and maintain global economic inequality. This is another potential critique of human security, as it implies that the concept could be used to justify policies that benefit wealthy nations at the expense of weaker ones.\n\nOption C states that human security is too broad. This argument suggests that human security is too vague and all-encompassing, making it difficult to implement and measure its effectiveness. This is a valid critique of human security, as its broad scope can make it challenging to define and achieve.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) All of these options, as all of the potential critiques listed are valid concerns about human security.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

However, it does not account for the later developments in the evolution of state responses to TNC.\n(B) This choice describes an increasing willingness to address TNC by reducing asymmetries between countries and targeting individual perpetrators, but it does not account for the US war on drugs or the global war on terror's influence on the governmental response.\n(C) This choice describes the US war on drugs' influence on the governmental response to TNC, with an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement and the use of sticks to induce states to increase regulation.

Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated.\n(D) Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated.
