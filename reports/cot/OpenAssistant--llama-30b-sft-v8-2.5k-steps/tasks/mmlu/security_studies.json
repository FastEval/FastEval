So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",

Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

As long as economic conditions remain stable, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is unlikely.\n\nStatement (B) foresees a 'new international energy order', one characterized by a move away from liberal free-market trading and towards statism and neo-mercantilism in response to energy scarcity.\n\nStatement (C) asserts that oil perpetuates an unequal and unjust distribution of wealth and power. Those who benefit from the current order will ensure that energy supplies remain available to maintain their position.\n\nStatement (D) anticipates that energy scarcity will lead to geopolitical confrontation, including the possibility of 'resource wars'.\n\nThe liberal perspective on energy security likely aligns with statement (A) or at least incorporates similar ideas.

Some critics have raised concerns about this approach. Let's review the options and the reasoning for the objections:\n\n(A) Neo-colonial: This refers to the practice of using humanitarian efforts or aid as a cover for maintaining colonial control or influence. Critics argue that the human security concept could be used to justify interventions or interference in other countries under the guise of protecting individual security.\n\n(B) Global capitalism: Critics of neoliberalism or global capitalism argue that the human security concept could be co-opted by powerful interests to serve the expansion of global markets and capital accumulation. This could lead to negative consequences for local communities and the environment.\n\n(C) Too broad: Some argue that the broad definition of human security encompasses so many different aspects of life that it risks becoming vague or ineffective. It can be difficult to develop specific policies or strategies to address such a wide range of issues.\n\n(D) All of these options: In some cases, the criticisms mentioned above have all been leveled against human security, but some also argue that the concept has the potential to address these challenges.\n\nAns",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",
