When we say \"training examples\", we are referring to the data that is used to teach the model to make predictions.\n2. As the number of training examples goes to infinity, the model can learn more and more information about the underlying data distribution.\n3. If the data is infinite, the model can learn every possible relationship and detail in the data, which means it can make very precise predictions.\n4. However, the more complex a model is, the more likely it is to overfit, which means that it performs well on the training data but poorly on new data that it hasn't seen before.\n5. Overfitting occurs when a model is too sensitive to the specific details of the training data, and it fails to generalize to new data that may have slightly different patterns.\n6. The more training data we have, the more likely it is that the model will overfit, since there are more opportunities for it to learn details that are unique to the training data.\n7. Overfitting leads to higher variance, because the model is more likely to make predictions that are far away from the true value.\n8. Therefore, the answer is B, higher variance.",
