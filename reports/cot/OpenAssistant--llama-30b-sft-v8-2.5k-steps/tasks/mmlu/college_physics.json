            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we want to find the number of times out of 100 that the detector will detect the 100 photons. This is an average value, so we multiply 100 by the quantum efficiency to get the number of detects average per 100 incident photons. This is 100 * 0.1, which equals 10. We take this 10 and divide by the square root of the total number of incident photons, which is \u221a100, or 10. This gives 10 / 10 = 1. Therefore, the answer is (A). \n\nAnswer: (A) an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 4",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The most strongly reflected wavelength can be determined by considering the boundary between the oil and water. Since the oil has a higher index of refraction (1.5) than the water (1.33), light will be totally internally reflected at the interface between the two media. The critical angle for this boundary is given by:\n\nCritical angle = sin^-1 (opposite/adjacent) = sin^-1 (1.33/1.5) = 63.16^@\n\nFor angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, total internal reflection occurs. Since white light contains all wavelengths, each wavelength will be refracted differently when passing through the oil and water. However, for this particular problem, we only need to consider the case when all the wavelengths are incident at the critical angle.\n\nFor angles equal to the critical angle, the angle of reflection will also be the critical angle (assuming the medium is monochromatic). Therefore, the wavelength that is most strongly reflected will be the one with the corresponding critical angle closest to the critical angle for the boundary between the oil and water.\n\nLet's calculate the critical angles for each of the wavelengths:\n\nFor a wavelength of 500 nm:\nCritical angle = sin^-1 (1.33/1.5) = 63.16^@\n\nFor a wavelength of 550 nm:\nCritical angle = sin^-1 (1.33/1.52) = 61.97^@\n\nFor a wavelength of 600 nm:\nCritical angle = sin^-1 (1.33/1.56) = 58.66^@\n\nFor a wavelength of 650 nm:\nCritical angle = sin^-1 (1.33/1.62) = 55.40^@\n\nTherefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength is (B) 550 nm.",
