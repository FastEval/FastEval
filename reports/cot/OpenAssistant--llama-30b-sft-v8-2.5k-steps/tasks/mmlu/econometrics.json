Here is a step-by-step explanation of the differences:\n\n1. The DF approach tests for a unit root in a single equation, while the PP approach tests for the presence of a unit root in a system of equations.\n2. The null hypothesis of the DF test is that the unit root is present (i.e., the series is non-stationary), while the null hypothesis of the PP test is that the series is stationary (i.e., the unit root is absent).\n3. The PP approach does not have an automatic correction for autocorrelated residuals in the test regression.\n4.

Log-returns can indeed be interpreted as changes in prices over time.\nB. Log-returns can be added up to calculate returns for longer time periods. For example, the annual return for a security can be calculated by multiplying its log-return for each period within the year.\nC. Log-returns can be added across a portfolio of assets to calculate portfolio returns. This is known as geometric averaging.\nD. Log-returns are known for their heavy tails, which means that large return events occur disproportionately more often than one would expect under a normal distribution. Therefore, we can eliminate this option as well.\n4.

The model includes a lagged dependent variable, which captures the effect of past shocks on the current period return. Therefore, (ii) is captured.\n(iii) Volatility clustering: Volatility clustering refers to the tendency for high volatility to be followed by periods of high volatility and vice versa. This can be captured using a standard GARCH(1,1) model by including the lagged squared residuals as a regressor in the model. Therefore, (iii) is captured.\n(iv) Volatility affecting returns: A standard GARCH(1,1) model assumes that the variance of returns is proportional to the squared lagged return, which captures the effect of volatility on returns.
