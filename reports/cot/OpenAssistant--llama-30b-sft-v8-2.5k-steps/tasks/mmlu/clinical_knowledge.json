            "model_answer": "Here is my thought process:\n\nA rapid blood transfusion is a medical procedure in which large amounts of blood are quickly replaced in a patient's body. The choice of cannula size depends on the rate of blood flow required, the patient's blood pressure, and the viscosity of the blood.\n\nA 18 gauge cannula has a large inner diameter and is typically used for high-flow applications such as emergency resuscitation and rapid blood transfusions. However, it may not be suitable for patients with low blood pressure or high viscosity blood as it could cause hemolysis (rupture of red blood cells).\n\nA 20 gauge cannula has a smaller inner diameter and is commonly used for blood transfusions and dialysis. It is a good balance between flow rate and resistance, but it may not be suitable for patients with severely low blood pressure, as it may not be able to supply enough blood to the body.\n\nA 22 gauge cannula has an even smaller inner diameter and is typically used for slow infusions and medication administration. It may not be suitable for rapid blood transfusions as it would require a higher flow rate, which could cause excessive shear stress on the blood cells.\n\nA 24 gauge cannula has an extremely small inner diameter and is usually used for pediatric patients or when a low-flow rate is required. It would not be suitable for a rapid blood transfusion as it would not be able to supply the necessary amount of blood quickly enough.\n\nBased on these considerations, the best choice for a rapid blood transfusion would be an 18 gauge cannula.",

            "model_answer": "(D) stamina.\n\nThe key attribute in successful marathon running is stamina, which refers to the ability to maintain a steady level of physical activity over a prolonged period of time. While strength and power are important for a marathon runner to have, stamina is necessary for a runner to complete the entire 26.2 miles of a marathon without becoming too exhausted. Stride length is also important, as longer strides can lead to a faster pace, but it is the overall endurance and stamina of the runner that determines their success in completing the marathon.",

            "model_answer": "Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that occurs quickly and can be life-threatening. It is characterized by a rapid onset of symptoms, including skin changes, respiratory symptoms, and cardiovascular symptoms.\n\nThe most common symptoms of anaphylaxis include:\n\n* Skin changes, such as hives and angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat).\n* Respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, shortness of breath, and stridor (a high-pitched whistling sound when breathing out, often heard in young children with upper airway obstruction).\n* Cardiovascular symptoms, such as a drop in blood pressure and an increased heart rate.\n\nRarely, anaphylaxis can also cause bradycardia (a slow heart rate) as a result of severe hypotension (low blood pressure).\n\nNow, let's consider the four options listed:\n\n(A) Stridor is a common symptom of anaphylaxis, particularly in young children with upper airway obstruction.\n(B) Bradycardia is a rare symptom of anaphylaxis, as a result of severe hypotension and low blood pressure.\n(C) Severe wheeze is a common symptom of anaphylaxis, particularly in individuals with asthma or a history of allergic rhinitis.\n(D) Rash is not a specific symptom of anaphylaxis. While individuals with a severe allergic reaction may develop a rash, it can also be caused by other factors.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) Rash.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint. \n\nExplanation: \n\nDiplopia, also known as double vision, occurs when two different images are being sent to the brain from two non-aligned eyes. This can occur due to numerous reasons, such as muscle weakness, nerve damage, or misalignment of the eyes. \n\nOption A suggests that if one eye is covered, diplopia cannot occur. However, this is not always true as some conditions may cause diplopia even when one eye is covered. For example, a condition called third nerve palsy can cause diplopia even with one eye covered. \n\nOption B suggests that the outer image is always the false image. This is not true as in some cases, the inner image can be the false image. So option B is not correct.\n\nOption C suggests that a fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards. This is not entirely correct as a fourth nerve palsy can occur when the eyes are in any position, not just when looking upwards. \n\nOption D is the best explanation. A sixth nerve palsy is a type of nerve damage that affects the sixth cranial nerve, also known as the abducens nerve. This nerve is responsible for controlling the lateral movement of the eye, and a palsy can cause weakness in this nerve. This can result in divergent squint, which is when the eyes turn outwards, also known as esotropia. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",

            "model_answer": "Answer: (A) elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Sodium bicarbonate is an alkali that can help to maintain a slightly alkaline blood pH.\n2. When it is ingested, it dissociates into sodium and bicarbonate ions in the stomach.\n3. These ions are then absorbed into the bloodstream, where they can help to buffer acid in the extracellular fluid.\n4. During exercise, the acidity in the muscles increases, leading to fatigue and a decrease in performance.\n5. By elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid, sodium bicarbonate can help to maintain a more alkaline environment, which allows for a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from the muscle.\n6. This helps to improve performance by delaying fatigue and allowing for a more efficient use of oxygen and energy by the muscles.",
