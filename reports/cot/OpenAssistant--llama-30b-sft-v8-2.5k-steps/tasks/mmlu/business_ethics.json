            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) Work-life balance.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what is meant by the words \"work-related\" and \"non-work-related\" activities. These terms refer to activities that are related to an employee's job or employment and activities that are not related to their job or employment.\n\nNext, we need to consider the idea of a preferred ratio between these two types of activities. This suggests that there is a desire to balance work and non-work activities in a certain way.\n\nThe term \"intensification of work\" and \"technological shifts\" suggest that there have been changes in the work environment that have made it more difficult to maintain a balance between work and non-work activities.\n\nFinally, the phrase \"hotly contested issue in recent years\" indicates that there is ongoing debate and discussion about this topic.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer must be something that relates to the balance between work and non-work activities that has become a topic of debate in recent years. This can be found in option (D) Work-life balance.",

The sentence is comparing something to their natural counterparts, which are described as being made up of a balanced network of interdependent organisms and their environments.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the Options\nLook at the options given to determine which one of them best describes what is being compared in the first sentence.\n\nOption (A) is \"Industrial supply loops,\" is related to supply chain management, which involves moving goods and resources through different stages of production and distribution. It does not match the description of a balanced network of interdependent organisms and their environments.\n\nOption (B) is \"Industrial ecosystems,\" matches the description of a network of interdependent organisms and their environments, but it focuses only on industries and their relationships with resources and wastes. It is close, but not completely accurate.\n\nOption (C) is \"Ecological ecosystems,\" refers to the natural ecosystems made up of interconnected living and non-living things, but it doesn't include the aspect of industries and their relationships with resources and wastes.\n\nOption (D) is \"Corporate ecosystems,\" is a new concept that emerges from sustainability thinking that comprises of companies and industries bound together and interdependent due to all kinds of resources and wastes. It accurately describes the network of interdependent organisms and their environments, as well as includes the idea of industry and their relationships with resources and wastes.\n\nStep 3: Analyze\nBased on the evaluation of the options, the answer is (D) \"Corporate ecosystems.\" \n\nStep 4: Write the Answer\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Corporate ecosystems.",

            "model_answer": "It is not clear which normative theory corporate profit maximization is most similar to as the goals of corporations and the goals of individuals are distinct. Professor Mankiw highlights three main goals of a firm which are survival, profit maximization and growing at a rate that at least matches the competition.\n\nCorporations are adept at profit maximization. The likelihood of survival in the short-term is increased when profit is maximized but long-term survival is not ensured since many factors are beyond a corporation's control. Growing at a rate that is at least as fast as the competition is also not necessarily tied to profit maximization.\nSo as the question asks for a best fit, it seems most accurate to say profit maximization is most similar to the hedonistic utilitarianism.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. \"Legal\" regulation suggests laws or rules, but this does not quite fit with \"goes further than\" and \"also concerns\". Referring to laws or rules may suggest a different level of constraint. Therefore, (A) is unlikely to be correct.\n2. \"Interactions\" from (A) and (C) only refers to communication and exchange between groups. This does not necessarily imply any deeper level of influence. Therefore, referring to interactions as if it implies a higher level of regulation may not be correct. Both (A) and (C) may be unlikely to be correct.\n3. \"Outcomes\" from (B) and (C) may refer to the effects or impacts of the relationship between CSOs and businesses. But again, it is unclear how this suggests a higher level of regulation of businesses specifically. It may suggest an implied influence if CSOs have a high level of influence over what is regulated, but not directly. Therefore, (B) and (C) may be unlikely to be correct.\n4. \"Environmental\" refers to the natural impacts of businesses. However this does not necessarily refer to regulation in the specific sense of laws and constraints. Therefore, (D) may also be unlikely to be correct.\n5. Therefore, there is no obvious single answer.\n\nRevised answer: It is still not clear what answer most accurately fills the blank in the input question.",
