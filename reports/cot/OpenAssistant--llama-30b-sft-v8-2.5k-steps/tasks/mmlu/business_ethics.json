            "model_answer": "Firstly, the passage mentions that cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly mainstream. This suggests that the answer choice should be something related to cryptocurrency.\n\nSecondly, the passage mentions that cryptocurrencies have associated ethical implications, such as being expensive and more secure. This eliminates answer choices (B) and (D) which do not mention cryptocurrency, and eliminates (C) which does not mention being expensive. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).\n\nThirdly, the passage also mentions that cryptocurrencies have been used to engage in financial crime. This suggests that the answer should be related to financial crime. This eliminates (C) which does not mention financial crime. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).\n\nAnswer: (A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The question is asking for a set of adjectives that describe what types of advertising are discouraged by regulatory bodies.\n* The first adjective in the list is \"encourage\", which is in the present tense and indicates that the action of encouraging something should be avoided.\n* The second adjective in the list is \"unnecessary\", which indicates that the action should not be performed if it is not necessary.\n* The third adjective in the list is \"fear\", which indicates that the action should not be performed in a way that causes fear.\n* The fourth adjective in the list is \"cause offence\", which indicates that the action should not be performed if it could cause offence.\n* The list of adjectives is framed as a set of rules that adverts should follow, and since the first rule uses the word \"encourage\", the answer should include the word \"encourage\" in the correct position.\n* Option (A) is incorrect because it uses the word \"safe\" which is not present in the list of rules. Option (C) is incorrect because it includes the word \"jealousy\", which is not mentioned in the list of rules. Option (D) is incorrect because it includes the word \"serious\", which is not the correct adjective to use for the third rule.\n* Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) Work-life balance.\n\nReasoning:\n\n\"Work-life balance\" refers to the preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\n\"Intensification of work and technological shifts\" suggests that work has become more demanding in recent years, making it harder to achieve a healthy balance.\n\n\"Hotly contested issue\" implies that there are debates and discussions around this topic.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Industrial ecosystems.\n\nReasoning:\n\n* The first sentence describes something that can be likened to natural counterparts, which suggests it is a man-made or artificial system that mimics natural ecosystems.\n* The second sentence mentions interdependent organisms and environments, which is commonly associated with natural ecosystems.\n* The third sentence suggests that the described system adds value to sustainability thinking by considering companies and industries as being bound together and interdependent, further emphasizing the industrial ecosystem theme.\n* (A) Industrial supply loops refer to the flow of goods, materials, and energy within a manufacturing or production process, which does not fit the description of a balanced network of organisms and environments.\n* (C) Ecological ecosystems refer to natural ecosystems that consist of living and non-living things interacting within a specific environment, which is similar to the description of the question but not the most accurate answer.\n* (D) Corporate ecosystems refer to networks of companies and organizations that interact with each other in complementary or competitive ways, which is not mentioned in the passage and does not fit the description of an interdependent network of organisms and environments.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(B) Power imbalance, Resources, Co-opted\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The first blank states that the relationship between the two parties may be limited by a power imbalance, meaning one party has more power or influence than the other.\n2. The second blank refers to an unfair distribution of benefits, suggesting that one party gains more from the relationship than the other.\n3. The third blank indicates that CSOs (civil society organizations) can be hoodwinked or manipulated by profit-driven businesses, highlighting the risk of manipulation by the more powerful party.\n4. Option (A) is incorrect because the two blanks do not align with the given information, as \"power imbalance\" is not mentioned as a blank and \"benefits\" are not mentioned in the explanation.\n5. Option (C) is also incorrect as the two blanks do not align and the given information does not match any of the blank-fillers.\n6. Option (D) is incorrect because the first blank does not match the information provided, as \"informational asymmetries\" are not mentioned as a limitation of business-CSO collaborations.\n7.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Points for (A) Dynamic can be gathered from the phrase \"working patterns\", implying a pattern of work that changes over time. The phrase \"temporal, spatial and task related fluidity\" also hints at changeableness, as things that are \"fluid\" can change easily or are malleable. Additionally, \"dynamic\" is a synonym for \"lively or active\", which suggests energy or change in the work.\n\nWhat about Points for (B) Fluid? The phrase \"working patterns\" again seems like a pattern of work that changes over time. The phrase \"temporal, spatial and task related fluidity\" also hints at changeableness, as things that are \"fluid\" can change easily or are malleable. Additionally, \"fluid\" is also a synonym for \"flowing or moving\", raising similar ideas of change or energy in the work.\n\n Points for (C) Flexible? The phrase \"working patterns\", implying a pattern of work that changes over time. The phrase \"temporal, spatial and task related fluidity\" also hints at changeableness, as things that are \"fluid\" can change easily or are malleable. Additionally, \"flexible\" is also a synonym for bending or malleable, which suggests that the work is adaptable and can change in shape or fixed reality.\n\nFinally, Points for (D) Modern? The phrase \"working patterns\", implying a pattern of work that changes over time. The phrase \"temporal, spatial and task related fluidity\" also hints at changeableness, as things that are \"fluid\" can change easily or are malleable. However, \"modern\" raising idea of working practices that are \"modern\" or up-to-date technologically, and it's not raising idea of working practices that are adaptable and changeable.\n\nWell then, the best answer is ...
