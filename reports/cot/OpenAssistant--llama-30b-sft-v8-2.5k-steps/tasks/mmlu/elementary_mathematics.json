            "model_answer": "The question at hand is, what is the value of p in 24 = 2p. We are trying to solve for p. We will use basic algebra to solve for p. \n\nThe first thing we want to do is simplify the equation. We have 24 = 2p, we want to get p by itself so we can solve for it. To do this we want to divide both sides of the equation by 2, we will get p/2 = 24/2, now we can simplify by dividing both sides by 12.\n\nNow that the equation is simplified to p = 12, we need to check our answer by plugging it back into the original equation to make sure it works. 24 = 2p, replace p with our calculated value of p which is 12. 24 = 2*12\n\nWe can check this answer by plugging p = 12 back into the original equation, 24 = 2p, it looks like it works. 24 = 2p which is true! \n\nTherefore, the value of p in 24 = 2p is 12. \n\n(D) p = 24",
