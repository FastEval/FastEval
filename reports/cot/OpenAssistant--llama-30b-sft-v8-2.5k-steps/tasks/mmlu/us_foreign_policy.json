            "model_answer": "The United Nations Security Council is the main decision-making body for international peace and security matters. It has the power to determine threats to international peace and take actions to address them. The Council is composed of 15 member states, five of which are permanent members with veto power. These permanent members are the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, and Russia. The remaining 10 member states are elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms. These non-permanent members do not have veto power. The Security Council is responsible for maintaining peace and security on the international level, by recommending prudential measures, such as economic sanctions, military intervention or peacekeeping operations. The Council is also responsible for exercising the sanctions, derived from the United Nations Charter, such as preventive or enforcement measures, such as blockades or tariffs. The Security Council is made up of 15 member states, five of which are permanent members with veto power, and ten elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms. The final answer is (A) 5 permanent members with veto power, 10 rotating members with no veto power.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Answer: A\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution was a joint resolution passed by the United States Congress in August 1964 in response to the Gulf of Tonkin incident.\n2. The Gulf of Tonkin incident was a pair of attacks by North Vietnamese boats on United States naval vessels on August 2 and 4, 1964.\n3. The resolution gave President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to \"take all necessary measures\" to defend American forces and prevent further attacks.\n4. The resolution effectively signaled the start of full-scale American involvement in the Vietnam War, as it provided the legal basis for the escalation of US involvement in Vietnam.\n5. Before the resolution, the US had been providing military and economic aid to South Vietnam, but after the resolution, the US increased its troops presence and began conducting large-scale military operations in Vietnam.\n\nTherefore, the significance of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution was to allow the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking about nonstate actors that pose a threat to the United States. A nonstate actor is any entity that is not a state, and can include individuals or groups without a formal government or military structure.\n\nA terrorist is an individual or a group of individuals who use violence to intimidate or coerce a population, or to influence a government's policy. Terrorists aim to create a sense of fear or uncertainty in a society and often target civilians as well as government and military targets.\n\nOrganized crime refers to criminal groups that have a structured hierarchy and are involved in illegal activities such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and other illicit activities. These groups are often motivated by profit and aim to acquire power and wealth through criminal activities.\n\nDrug traffickers are individuals or groups of people who smuggle illegal drugs across international borders for sale and distribution. They often work with organized crime groups and are motivated by the profit of the drug trade.\n\nChina, on the other hand, is a state and not a nonstate actor. As a state, China has a formal government and military structure and is not typically considered a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States.\n\nA) Terrorists, B) Organized crime, and C) Drug traffickers are all examples of nonstate actors that can pose a threat to the United States.\n\n(D) China is not a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The first American president to visit communist China was Richard Nixon. Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. We need to find the first American president to visit communist China. This narrows down the options to presidents who visited China during the Cold War, when China was a communist country.\n2. Out of the options given, Richard Nixon was the first American president to visit China, from February 21 to 28, 1972. Up until then, the U.S. had no official relations with China.\n3. Up until today, only two American presidents have not visited China while in office: Theodore Roosevelt and Barack Obama. And since Jimmy Carter was the last American president to visit China, from December 10 to 12, 1978, Richard Nixon was before him.\n4. The first American president to visit China, and thus the first American president to visit communist China, was Richard Nixon. So, the answer is (A) Richard Nixon. The parenthesis [] indicate that this is an item in a list, and the letter A signifies that Richard Nixon was the first option in the list.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (A).\n\nFirstly, the question asks for the first accord on nuclear weapons signed between the United States and the Soviet Union. This rules out options (B), (C), and (D) as none relate specifically to nuclear weapons.\n\nSecondly, option (C) is also eliminated as it refers to a treaty being rejected by the U.S. Senate, which does not fit the context of the question.\n\nThirdly, we can eliminate option (D) as it refers to the elimination of long-range nuclear missiles, but that does not specify whether it was the first such treaty signed between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining option is (A), which specifically states that the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was the first accord on nuclear weapons signed between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nAnswer: (A) on nuclear weapons signed between the United States and the Soviet Union.",

This strengthened the notion of American exceptionalism globally.\n\n(C) The extension of American power globally challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism:\nThe Cold War also brought challenges and debates regarding the expansion of American power and interventionism. Some argued that these actions went against core values of exceptionalism, such as Promotion of democracy and self-determination.\n\n(D) Both b and c:\nThe implications of the Cold War for American exceptionalism were complex.
