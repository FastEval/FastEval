            "model_answer": "(1) Recall that the degree of a field extension is defined as the dimension of the vector space of the extension field as a vector space over the base field.\n\n(2) If K/F is a field extension, then the dimension of K as an F-vector space is equal to the number of independent elements in K that can be written as F-linear combinations of elements from a chosen F-basis of K.\n\n(3) The set {1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(6), sqrt(18)} is an SQ-basis of the extension field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q.\n\n(4) Since {1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(6), sqrt(18)} is an SQ-basis of the extension field, then the dimension of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) as an F-vector space over Q is equal to the number of elements in this set, which is 5.\n\n(5) Therefore, the degree of the extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is 5.\n\nAnswer: (C) 2",

            "model_answer": "We need to find the index of the permutation p in S5.\n\nStep 1: We can write p as a product of two disjoint cycles: (1 2 5 4) and (2 3). Therefore p = (1 2 5 4)(2 3).\n\nStep 2: To find the index of p in S5, we need to compute the index of p in its stabilizer. The stabilizer of p is the subgroup of S5 that consists of all the permutations that fix p. In other words, it is the set of all permutations that leave p unchanged whencomposing them with p.\n\nStep 3: We can use the fact that the index of p in S5 is equal to the index of the stabilizer of p in S5.\n\nStep 4: To compute the index, we first need to determine the order of p and the order of the stabilizer of p. The order of p is the least common multiple of the lengths of its cycles. In this case, the least common multiple of 4 and 2 is 4. Therefore p has order 4.\n\nStep 5: Next, we need to find the index of the stabilizer of p in S5. We can do this by counting the number of permutations that fix the set of elements that are linearly dependent on p. In other words, we need to count the number of permutations that map the elements in p's support to themselves.\n\nStep 6: The linearly dependent elements in p's support are 1, 2, 5, and 4. We can show that a permutation f is in the stabilizer of p if and only if f maps these elements to themselves. Therefore the index of p is equal to the number of permutations in S5 that fix the set {1, 2, 5, 4}.\n\nStep 7: We can count the number of such permutations by first counting the number of permutations in S4 that fix the set {1, 2, 5}. This is equal to the number of permutations of {1, 2, 5} (which is isomorphic to S3). Then we append a 4 to each such permutation to obtain a permutation in S5. Therefore the index of p is equal to the number of permutations of {1, 2, 5} plus one.\n\nStep 8: The number of permutations of {1, 2, 5} is equal to factorial(3). Therefore the index of p is equal to factorial(3) + 1, which is 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 24.",

            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We are looking for a zero of the polynomial f(x) = x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x in the field Z_5.\n2. The degree of the polynomial is 5, so we are looking for a solution such that f(x) = 0.\n3. We can use the zero-factor theorem to find a solution. The theorem states that if f(a) = 0 and g(x) is a polynomial of lower degree than f(x), then g(x) is a factor of f(x).\n4. Since f(x) is a polynomial of degree 5, the only possible factors of it are linear or irreducible quadratic factors.\n5. The coefficients of f(x) are in the field Z_5, so we can choose a and b such that a+b = 1.\n6. If we let a = 2 and b = 0, then f(x) = 2x^5 + 3*2x^3 + x^2 + 2*0x = 2x(x^4 + 3x^2 + 1) + x.\n7. Since the coefficients of this new polynomial are all 0 or 1, we can take advantage of the fact that we are working in the field Z_5 and simplify.\n8. x^4 + 3x^2 + 1 = -(2x^2 + x + 3)/(2x^2 + 1)\n9. So, a+b = 1 can be written as (2x^2 + 2x + 3)/(2x^2 + 1) or ((2x+3)/2+1)/(2x^2 + 1).\n10. We can take advantage of the fact that we are working in the field Z_5 and simplify.\n11. So, f(x) = 2x(x^4 + 3x^2 + 1) + x = 2x((3x^2 + 3)/2 + 1) or 2x(3x^2 + 3)/2 + 2x.\n12. We can take advantage of the fact that we are working in the field Z_5 and simplify.\n13. The constant term 2x is a linear factor of f(x).\n14. We can take advantage of the fact that we are working in the field Z_5 and simplify.\n15. So, f(x) = 2x(3x^2 + 3)/2 + 2x can be written as (2x(3x^2 + 3)/2)/(2x^2 + 1).\n16. We can take advantage of the fact that we are working in the field Z_5 and simplify.\n17. So, f(x) = (2x(3x^2 + 3)/2)/(2x^2 + 1) or (3x^3)/2 can be written as (3(x+3)/2+1)/(2x^2 + 1).\n18. Therefore, there are no solutions in the field Z_5.\n\nAnswer: (B) 1.",

The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements in the first ring that map to the identity element in the second ring. If the kernel is the set {0}, then it means that every element in the first ring must map to the identity. \n\nStatement 2:  Q is an ideal in R.\n\nAn ideal is a nonempty set of elements in a ring that is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication by elements of the ring. It also must contain the additive inverse of any of its elements. An ideal is said to be proper if it is not the entire ring. \n\nGiven these two statements, we must determine if they are both true or both false. \n\nAs we have analyzed above, Statement 1. is true as it describes the condition for a ring homomorphism to be one-to-one, which is that the kernel must be {0}. \n\nTherefore, we look at Statement 2. Given that Q is an ideal in R, it means that the set Q is closed under addition and subtraction, and all products of elements in Q and elements of R are also in Q, and it also contains the additive inverse of any of its elements. \n\nWe know that the ideal must be nonempty and must contain the additive inverse of any of its elements.
