In a group, the order of an element is the number of elements in the group. If a group has an element of order 15, it means that the group has at least one element whose order is 15. Now, to satisfy this requirement, the group must have at least 7 more elements whose order is 15 (because 15 + 7 = 15 x 8). Hence the group should have at least 8 elements of order 15. Therefore, the first statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\nExplanation: This statement is also true if we consider the properties of groups. Let us assume that a group has more than 8 elements of order 15. In this case, the total number of elements in the group will be greater than 15 x 8 = 120 (assuming we only consider elements of order 15). Let's denote this number by n. Now, since the group has more than 8 elements of order 15, we can say that:\n\n15 x 8 + 15 x r >= n\n\nwhere r is the number of elements of order 15 left to reach n.

            "model_answer": "(D) False, True\n\nStep 1: Let's break down the question. We are given two statements and must determine whether they are true or false. \n\nStep 2: Statement 1 says that a ring homomorphism is one-to-one if and only if the kernel is {0}. A ring homomorphism is a function from one ring to another that preserves the structure of the rings. The kernel is the set of elements in the domain ring that are mapped to the zero element in the codomain. So, a homomorphism is one-to-one if it maps distinct elements in the domain to distinct elements in the codomain.\n\nStep 3: Statement 2 says that Q is an ideal in R. An ideal in a ring is a subset of the ring that is closed under addition and subtraction and contains the element 0. So, Q is an ideal in R if every element in Q can be obtained by adding and subtracting elements in R.\n\nStep 4: Now, let's determine whether the statements are true or false. We know that a ring homomorphism is one-to-one if and only if the kernel is {0}. However, we do not know anything about the specific ring homomorphism being considered. \n\nStep 5: Similarly, we know that Q is an ideal in R, but we do not know anything about the specific elements in Q or R.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, we cannot determine whether Statement 1 or Statement 2 is true or false without more information. \n\n(D) False, True",
