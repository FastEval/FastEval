            "model_answer": "This is a hierarchy of effects or sequential model used to explain how advertising works:\n\n(A) ADD.\n(B) AIDA.\n(C) PESTLE.\n(D) SWOT.\n\nThese are all models used to explain how advertising works and their order in the hierarchy. The order shows the increasing level of detail in which the effects of advertising are explained. \n\n(A) ADD stands for Attention, Desire, and Action. This model explains how advertising attracts attention, creates desire, and finally leads to action, such as purchasing a product.\n\n(B) AIDA stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action. This model builds upon the ADD model and adds the stage of interest. It explains how advertising first attracts attention, then generates interest, creates desire, and finally leads to action.\n\n(C) PESTLE stands for Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental factors. This model evaluates the external environment in which a business operates and considers how these factors influence advertising and its effectiveness.\n\n(D) SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. This model evaluates the internal and external environments of a business and considers how advertising can be used to exploit opportunities, mitigate threats, and improve upon weaknesses, while building upon strengths.\n\nAnswer: \n(D) SWOT.\nThis stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, and represents the highest level of detail in the hierarchy of effects or sequential model used to explain how advertising works. It considers both internal (strengths and weaknesses) and external (opportunities and threats) factors and how advertising can be used to improve a business's position in the marketplace.",

From the given options, we can eliminate (A) and (C) as they refer to specific decades. Therefore, we are left with (B) and (D). \n\nTo determine whether the answer is (B) or (D), we need to consider the period after the late 1800s and before the 1920s. This period includes the early part of the 20th century, which saw significant changes in marketing practices. \n\nWhen we look at the options, we can see that (B) refers to the early 1900s, which is before the Second World War. However, the Second World War played a significant role in shaping the world economy and changed the way businesses operated. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) After the end of the Second World War.",

This sentence means that the degree to which a service is connected to a product is influenced by several things. Which of the following is NOT one of the factors?

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "C.\n\nExplanation:\n1. The question describes a situation where there is an imbalance between a consumer's actual and desired state.\n2. The first answer choice, A, refers to the process of developing motivation, which is not directly related to the concept of an imbalance between actual and desired states.\n3. The second answer choice, B, refers to an attitude, which is a person's predisposition to differently evaluate stimuli and includes a tendency to respond to the same stimulus in a consistent manner. However, this also does not seem directly related to the concept of an imbalance between actual and desired states.\n4. The third answer choice, C, refers to self-concept, which is a person's understanding of, or beliefs about, themselves in terms of aspects such as skills, abilities, interests, goals, and values. This answer choice seems more relevant to the concept of an imbalance between actual and desired states, as it describes the process of a consumer becoming aware of a gap or problem that needs resolving.\n5. The fourth answer choice, D, refers to product evaluation, which is the process of evaluating and comparing different products to determine which one best meets the consumer's needs. While this may be a step in the purchasing process, it is not directly related to the concept of an imbalance between actual and desired states.\n6. Therefore, the answer is C.",

For example, if free samples of perfumes are always present when a person sees a magazine they can learn to associate the scent with the magazine.\n\nOperant conditioning involves learning from the consequences of an action. For example, trying a new perfume from a free sample in a magazine and liking it could reinforce trying new scents from free samples.\n\nSocial learning involves learning by observing others or imitating them. For example, people who see other people try free perfume samples in magazines and like them, might be encouraged to try the samples themselves.\n\nBehavioural learning simply refers to learning to associate a response with a stimulus, which in this case could be associating trying a perfume sample with the positive feelings of enjoying a new scent.\n\nThe answer is (D) Behavioural learning.",
