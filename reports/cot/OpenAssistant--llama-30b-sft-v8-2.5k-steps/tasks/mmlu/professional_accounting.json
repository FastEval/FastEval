If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the estimated yearly yield on the investment, we need to calculate the total daily, monthly, and yearly earnings and expenses.\n\nAt first glance, option D seems like the answer, since it appears to be the highest percentage. However, we need to look at all the numbers and calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily earnings:\n\n$245 * 2 hours per day = $490 per day\n\nSo the estimated daily earnings are $490 per day or $178,000 per year ($490 * 365 days).\n\nLet's calculate the estimated yearly operational expenses:\n\nDaily operational expenses: $50 per day * 365 days = $18,250\nYearly operational expenses: $18,250 + $98,000 (the purchase price of the limousine) = $116,250\n\nNow let's subtract the operational expenses from the estimated yearly earnings:\n\nYearly earnings: $178,000\nOperational expenses: $116,250\n\nNet earnings: $178,000 - $116,250 = $61,750\n\nFinally, we divide the net earnings by the purchase price to get the estimated yearly yield:\n\nNet earnings: $61,750\nPurchase price: $98,000\n\nYearly yield: $61,750 / $98,000 * 100% = 62.86%\n\nTherefore, the estimated yearly yield on the investment is (C) 0.45% (rounded to two decimal places).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) Understated Understated.\n\nHere's the explanation of the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The question states that Arno Co. did not record a credit purchase of merchandise made prior to year end. This means that the purchase was not recorded as a liability on the balance sheet, which would have been the normal accounting procedure.\n2. However, the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory. This means that it was recorded as an asset on the balance sheet.\n3. The question is asking about the effect of the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise on Arno's balance sheet at year-end.\n4. When a company makes a purchase, it typically records it as a liability on the balance sheet, with a corresponding entry in another asset account (such as inventory or property, plant, and equipment).\n5. If a purchase is not recorded as a liability, then the corresponding entry in another asset account will also not be recorded, resulting in an understatement of the asset account.\n6. Therefore, the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise by Arno Co. resulted in an understatement of its asset account, which is represented by the answer choice (D) Understated Understated in the parenthesis after the final line.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the Meaning of Nonsampling Risk\nNonsampling risk refers to the possibility that the auditor may not catch all the errors and frauds in the financial statements even after performing substantive testing on the samples. This can happen because the auditors could overlook mistakes or they could ignore fraudulent activities. Therefore, nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population. This is an unacceptable risk, because it can lead to the auditor not detecting all material misstatements in the financial statements. Thus, the correct answer would be (A). \nStep 2: Understand the Meaning of Sampling Risk\nSampling risk is the risk that the auditors could overlook mistakes or they could ignore fraudulent activities because of sampling error. This risk could arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements or because sampling error is possible due to the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. It also includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. \nStep 3: Check the Correctness of the Final Answer\nIn conclusion, the answer is (A).",

(A) - This procedure refers to subsequent events that occur after the balance sheet date. Since the inventory items were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end, they may have an impact on the entity's financial position. However, it may not necessarily result in a revision to the previously issued financial statements.\n2. Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate. (B) - This procedure refers to testing inadequacies in internal controls, which is not related to subsequent events. It is a separate audit procedure to review the design and implementation of internal controls.\n3. Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end. (C) - This procedure refers to analyzing post-balance sheet events in the form of bank statements, which is a step in auditing subsequent events. However, it is limited to the bank statements only and may not necessarily provide sufficient evidence to identify and evaluate all subsequent events.\n4. Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited. (D) - This procedure refers to comparing subsequent interim financial statements that may indicate a trend in the entity's performance with the financial statements being audited. It provides a comprehensive approach to auditing subsequent events by evaluating both individual events and general trends in the entity's financial position. It is the most appropriate option among the given choices.\n\nAnswer: (D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.",

            "model_answer": "The price of a bond can be calculated using the following formula: Price = Face Value / (1 + Yield) ^ Years.\n\nTo apply this formula to the given bond, we need to calculate the yield to maturity. We can do this by using the formula: Yield = (Coupon Payments * (Years * Face Value)) / Bond Price.\n\nIn this case, the coupon payment is 5% * $100 = $5, the years are 3, and the face value is $100. We also know that the yield is 6%.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for yield, we get: Yield = ($5 * (3 * $100)) / Bond Price.\n\nWe can simplify this expression by multiplying the $5 by $100 and then by $3:\n\nYield = ($5 * $100 * $3) / Bond Price.\n\nThis gives us: Yield = $150 / Bond Price.\n\nWe can now rewrite the formula for bond price as:\n\n$100 / (1 + $150 / Bond Price) ^ 3 - 1\n\nWe can simplify this expression by multiplying the $100 by -1:\n\nPrice = -$100 / (1 + $150 / Bond Price) ^ 3\n\nWe can now solve this equation by dividing both sides by -$100 and taking the absolute values:\n\nPrice = (-1) * ($100 / (1 + $150 / Bond Price) ^ 3)\n\nThis gives us:\n\nPrice = ($100 / (1 + $150 / Bond Price) ^ 3)\n\nNow let us evaluate this expression trying out the options from above.\n\nFor (A) - $100: trying to return 100 as answer will not work as the bond will never be sold with such price.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To solve this question, we need to use our knowledge of accounting. Specifically, we need to know how assets are classified and accounted for when they are being sold or disposed of.\n\n1. The first sentence says the old building is being actively marketed for sale and the company expects to complete the sale in four months. This tells us that the building is being sold and the expected sale date is in the near future.\n2. Based on this information, we can eliminate option (A) as the correct answer since reclassifying the building as an asset held for sale usually occurs when the sale date is expected to be in the distant future or when there is doubt about ever selling the asset.\n3. Option (B) can also be eliminated as the building is no longer in use and is being actively marketed for sale. This usually means it is classified as a non-current asset.\n4. The next step is to consider the purchase method of accounting and how assets are recorded in the financial statements. When a building is purchase, it is typically recorded at its historical cost, which is the purchase price plus the cost of any improvements. When the building is sold, the difference between its historical cost and the selling price is recognized as a gain or loss.\n5. With this in mind, we can eliminate option (D) as the correct answer, since the building will be valued at its fair market value when it is sold, not its historical cost.\n6. Finally, we consider the depreciation of the building. When a building is purchased, it is typically depreciated over its useful life. This means that a portion of the purchase price and any improvements are expensed over the building's useful life. However, when the building is sold, depreciation ceases and any remaining depreciable value is written off as a loss.\n7. Option (C) is therefore the correct answer since depreciation ceases when the building is sold and any remaining value is written off as a loss.",
