The correct statement about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer is D, which states that sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. This risk can arise when the auditor chooses audit procedures that do not adequately address the identified risks or when the auditor fails to assess the limitations of the chosen audit procedures. This risk is unique to sampling because the testing of a sample is dependent on the auditor's judgment and selection of audit procedures.

            "model_answer": "The answer to this question is (D) No effect.\n\nIf the bond is being amortized using the straight-line method, the effective interest rate method would result in a higher interest expense (a larger portion of the interest expense would be allocated to the current year). Therefore, the premium would have been amortized more quickly, resulting in the bond carrying amount being lower at June 30 year 12. However, the interest expense would also be higher, which would have decreased the statement of retained earnings. However, since this is a test question that explicitly states that \"Net income was not affected by the error\", we can deduce that the effect on retained earnings is not relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the question only asks about the impact on the bond carrying amount, which would be lower if the straight-line method was used instead of the effective interest rate method. However, we are told that there was no large and clearly unacceptableerror in the preparation of the financial statements, so there was no material budgeting or fiscal gap the error at June 30 year 12.

We can use the price-coupon-yield formula to calculate the bond's price.\n5.

During a tax year, the corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income and distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders. Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson\u2019s individual tax return. If the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate, how much income would Carson have reported on Carson\u2019s individual return?\n\n(A) $28,000\n(B) $132,000\n(C) $160,000\n(D) $188,000",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, let's look at the dividends that Carson received from the C corporation. Since Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock, they are entitled to 40% of the dividends. The total dividends distributed were $70,000, so Carson should have received $28,000 (40% of $70,000) in dividends.\n\nNext, we need to consider the taxable income of the C corporation. This means that we need to allocate a portion of the corporation's total taxable income to Carson's stock. If the corporation had been an S corporation, the income would have been passed through to the shareholders, and allocated to them based on their ownership percentage.\n\nFor an S corporation, each shareholder is required to report their pro rata share of the corporation's income on their individual return. If the corporation had been an S corporation, the $400,000 taxable income would have been allocated to each shareholder based on their ownership percentage. Since Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock, they would have been allocated 40% of the corporation's income.\n\nTo calculate the allocated income, we need to multiply the corporation's total taxable income by the shareholder's ownership percentage. For Carson, the allocated taxable income would be:\n\n$400,000 x 40% = $160,000\n\nFinally, we need to calculate Carson's gross income by adding their dividend income to their allocated taxable income. For Carson, we would have:\n\n$28,000 + $160,000 = $188,000\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) $188,000.",
