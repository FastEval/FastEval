            "model_answer": "A Robertsonian translocation is a type of chromosomal rearrangement that involves the fusion of two chromosomes at their centromeres. The fusion of the two centromeres results in a single, abnormal centromere that is unable to properly divide and segregate chromosomes during cell division. This can lead to chromosomal abnormalities and genetic disorders. Therefore, the answer is B) centromeres.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The X-linked recessive condition is expressed in females when:\n* They inherit a hemizygous X chromosome from their father,\n* The founder of the trait hemizygously expresses the condition.\n1. The probability of a female inheriting hemizygously is 1/2, as the father has only a 50% of passing his X chromosome.\n1. The probability of a female inheriting hemizygously from a founder is 1/1, as the founder passes on his hemizygosity to his daughter.\n1. Therefore:\n* F * (1/2) * 1/1 = 1/2\n* F = 0.5\n1. Applying the Hardy-Weinberg equation to the male hemizygotes, we find:\n* In males, the condition is found at a frequency of 1/10.\n* In females, the condition is found at a frequency of 1/2 * 1/10, or 1/20.\n1. The frequency of affected females is therefore:\n* 0.05 (one in twenty)\n\nThe answer is therefore (D: 0.05).

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The pattern of inheritance shown by malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is:\n\n(C) X-linked dominant.\n\nReasoning:\nMalignant hyperthermia, also known as hyperpyrexia, is a rare genetic disorder that is caused by defects in skeletal muscle cells. It is associated with characteristic symptoms such as muscle rigidity, high fever, and quick onset of muscle cell breakdown, leading to organ failure and death.\nThe inheritance pattern of a disorder can provide clues about the underlying genetic defects that cause it. Therefore, to determine the pattern of inheritance of malignant hyperthermia, we need to consider the following options:\n\n(A) Autosomal dominant: In this pattern, an individual with an abnormal dominant allele will express the trait and pass it on to 50% of their offspring. If either parent has the abnormal allele, there is a 50% risk of inheriting the disorder in each pregnancy.\n(B) Autosomal recessive: In this pattern, both alleles carrying the abnormal gene must be inherited to express the disorder. Therefore, the risk of inheriting the disorder is 25% for each pregnancy if both parents are carriers, and the risk is 0% if both parents are non-carriers.\n(C) X-linked dominant: In this pattern, the abnormal allele is carried on the X chromosome and is therefore inherited through the maternal line. Affected males (who inherit the abnormal X chromosome) will express the disorder, while affected females (who inherit one abnormal X chromosome and one normal X chromosome) may experience a milder form of the disorder.\n(D) X-linked recessive: In this pattern, the abnormal allele is carried on the X chromosome, and two copies of the abnormal allele must be inherited to express the disorder. Therefore, affected males will express the disorder while unaffected males carrying one abnormal X chromosome will be carriers, and affected females will occur only if they inherit two abnormal X chromosomes (since females usually have two X chromosomes).\n\nResearch suggests that the inheritance pattern of malignant hyperthermia is X-linked dominant, meaning that individuals who inherit the abnormal allele on their X chromosome from their mother (who is a carrier) will express the disorder. This finding is consistent with the fact that malignant hyperthermia is more commonly observed in males than females, due to the fact that males have only one X chromosome and therefore are more likely to inherit an abnormal allele on that chromosome. In contrast, females have two X chromosomes, which means that they are more likely to inherit a normal X chromosome that compensates for the abnormal one.",

Statement B suggests that the mapping of human chromosomes has progressed more successfully as more DNA markers have become available, which could provide more precise information about the location of genes on specific chromosomes.\n4. Statement C suggests that the mapping of human chromosomes has identified that the number of linkage groups is twice the number of chromosomes, which could indicate that some genes are located on multiple chromosomes or that some chromosomes contain more genes than others.\n5. Statement D suggests that the mapping of human chromosomes has shown that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes, which could indicate that the human genome is highly complex and contains a large number of genes that regulate various biological processes.\n6.

It results in an abnormal buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine in the body. Untreated PKU in a pregnant mother can lead to fetal brain damage and intellectual disability in the child.\n\nThe risk of PKU in the general population is around 1 in 10,000 to 15,000. The risk of PKU in the child of a mother with untreated PKU would depend on the frequency of the mutated gene in the mother's population. If we assume that the mutation is equally frequent, then the risk of PKU in the child of a mother with untreated PKU would also be around 1 in 10,000 to 15,000.\n\nTherefore, we can eliminate answer choices (B) and (C) because they are both higher than the general risk of PKU in the population.
