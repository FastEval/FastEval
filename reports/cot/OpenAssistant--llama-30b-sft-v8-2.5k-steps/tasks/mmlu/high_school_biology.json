            "question": "In a population of giraffes, an environmental change occurs that favors individuals that are tallest. As a result, more of the taller individuals are able to obtain nutrients and survive to pass along their genetic information. This is an example of\n\n(A) directional selection.\n(B) stabilizing selection.\n(C) sexual selection.\n(D) disruptive selection.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Directional selection occurs when there is a bias in one direction of the phenotypic distribution, leading to an increase in the frequency of one extreme of the distribution at the expense of the other. In this case, the environmental change has led to a selective advantage for individuals that are taller, which is driving the population in a particular direction by increasing the frequency of taller individuals. This is indicative of directional selection. Therefore, the answer is (A) directional selection.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The electron transport chain is part of cellular respiration, specifically the process of oxidative phosphorylation. During oxidative phosphorylation, electrons are passed through a series of protein complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane, ultimately reducing oxygen to water and generating a proton gradient across the membrane. The energy derived from this process is used to synthesize ATP, the primary source of energy for cellular processes. Therefore, the answer is (C) produce ATP.",

            "model_answer": "A. The reason is that oxygen is a highly reactive gas and would have reacted with other gases and minerals in the primitive Earth's atmosphere and surface, preventing it from accumulating in large amounts.\n\nB. Hydrogen was likely also not abundant in the primitive Earth's atmosphere as it would have reacted with other gases and minerals, similar to oxygen.\n\nC. Ammonia is a strongly reducing gas, meaning it would have reacted with oxidizing gases such as nitrogen or oxygen in the primitive Earth's atmosphere and surface, preventing it from accumulating in large amounts.\n\nD. Methane could have been present in the primitive Earth's atmosphere, as it is a stable gas and has been detected in other planetary systems. Therefore, the answer is D.",
