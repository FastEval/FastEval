As a result, more of the taller individuals are able to obtain nutrients and survive to pass along their genetic information. This is an example of\n\n(A) directional selection.\n(B) stabilizing selection.\n(C) sexual selection.\n(D) disruptive selection.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) directional selection.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Directional selection occurs when a specific extreme trait is favored, resulting in a shift in the population's mean toward that trait.\n* In this scenario, the environmental change favors tall individuals, thus selecting for the extreme trait of height.\n* Stabilizing selection would occur if the environment favored the average, or \" simplest,\" trait, thus selecting for average height.\n* Sexual selection likely does not play a role in this scenario as height is not a typical sexual selection trait in giraffes, as males do not compete for mates through height.\n* Disruptive selection would occur if two mutually exclusive traits are favored, leading to two separate populations, but height is a single, continuous trait.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The greatest deleterious effect on an mRNA would be caused by a deletion of a nucleotide triplet.\n\nmRNA molecules initiate with a start codon (usually AUG) which signals the ribosome to start translating the gene into a protein. If a deletion of a single nucleotide or a single nucleotide substitution of the first or third codon position occurs, the start codon could still function to begin translation, and the effects on protein structure and function could be minimized.\n\nIn contrast, a deletion of a nucleotide triplet would shift the reading frame of the mRNA, which could lead to a premature stop codon and prevent the production of a functional protein entirely, or produce a protein with an altered amino acid sequence and likely a different, non-functional or malfunctioning protein product. Therefore, a deletion of a nucleotide triplet would have the greatest deleterious effect on an mRNA.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The electron transport chain is a series of protein complexes found in the inner membrane of mitochondria and some bacteria. Electrons from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) pass through a series of protein complexes, where they are passed from one electron carrier to another until they reach oxygen, which acts as the final electron acceptor.\n\nAs electrons are passed from one electron carrier to another, the energy from the electrons is used to produce a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This proton gradient is then used by the ATP synthase complex to produce ATP.\n\nTherefore, the energy given up by electrons as they move through the electron transport chain is used to produce ATP.\n\nAnswer: (C) produce ATP",

            "model_answer": "Convergent evolution is a process where unrelated organisms evolve similar traits in order to adapt to similar environments or needs. This process is best exemplified by option (C) the wings of an insect and the wings of a bird.\n\nBoth insect wings and bird wings serve the purpose of flight and have a broad surface that allows the animals to glide through the air. However, the two types of wings have very different structures. Insect wings are thin and delicate, with a network of veins that provide support and allow them to be folded when not in use. Bird wings, on the other hand, have a more rigid structure, with a single major bone running through them and a covering of feathers.\n\nFurthermore, the path that led to the development of wings in each group involved different genetic changes and evolutionary pathways. Insects inherited their wings from a common ancestor with gills, which evolved into the broad, veined wings we see today. Birds' wings evolved from the forelimbs of their fish ancestors, with the fingers elongating and becoming tipped with feathery structures.\n\nIn summary, convergent evolution is best exemplified by the unrelated development of wings in insects and birds, which have similar functions but different structures and evolutionary histories.\n\nAnswer: C) The wings of an insect and the wings of a bird.",

            "model_answer": "(C) longitudinal section of a shoot tip would most likely provide examples of mitotic cell divisions.\n\nReasoning:\n\nMitosis is the process of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells. It is a crucial process in growth, repair, and asexual reproduction. In plants, mitotic cell divisions occur in actively growing regions, such as shoot tips.\n\nA cross section of muscle tissue (A) would not likely contain examples of mitotic cell divisions because muscle cells are typically post-mitotic and do not divide.\n\nA cross section of an anther (B) might contain examples of mitotic cell divisions, as these are the\nsite of pollen production in a flower. However, it is less likely than the shoot tip.\n\nA cross section of a leaf (D) might contain examples of mitotic cell divisions, particularly in the growing regions of the leaf.

Cells that are infected by pathogens are marked for destruction by immune cells, and then destroyed by phagocytes.\n* Option (B) therefore is the correct answer, as phagocytes are a type of immune cell that engulfs and destroys pathogens and infected cells. Option (D) is also involved in the immune response of invertebrates, as helper T-cells stimulate the production of antibodies and activate other immune cells like phagocytes.
