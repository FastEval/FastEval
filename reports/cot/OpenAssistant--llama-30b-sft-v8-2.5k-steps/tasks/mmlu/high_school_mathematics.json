But to get the answer, we only need one of these vertices. Let's move on to the next step.\n\nStep 2: Identify one of the vertices of the mirror image.\nLooking at the coordinates of P' we can see that they are simply the negation of P's coordinates. Since the original question asked for P's coordinates, we need to negate each coordinate of P' as well. This gives us:\n\n(2, 4) -> (\u20132, \u20134)\n(4, 1) -> (\u20134, 1)\n(1, \u20134) -> (\u20131, 4)\n(\u20132, \u20134) -> (2, 4)\n(\u20133, 0) -> (3, 0)\n\nSo all the vertices of P' are the same as the vertices of P.

To do so, we can count the number of outcomes where Joe eats the same fruit three times in a row and subtract that from the total outcomes.\n\nIf Joe eats the same fruit three times in a row, the number of options for the first two meals (let's say breakfast and lunch) is 3x3=9.

Let's draw a picture of the function and the two points it passes through. ![strictly convex function through two points](https://i.imgur.com/7H9v5lV.png)\n\nSince the function is strictly convex, we can draw a dotted line from $(-2,5)$ to $(2,9)$ that slopes downward to the right. This dotted line will intersect the graph of the function at two points. One of these points is $(-1, f(-1))$, where $f(-1)<5$ because the function always lies below its secant line in any interval. The other point where the dotted line intersects the function is $(1,f(1))$. Since the function is continuous, we can draw a vertical line at $x=1$ intersecting the dotted line at two points, $(-1, f(-1))$ and $(1,f(1))$.\n\n![strictly convex function through two points, with right-facing dotted line](https://i.imgur.com/7H9v5lV.png)\n\nThis dotted line will intersect the $y$-axis at $(1,f(1))$. Since the function is strictly convex, it will always lie below the dotted line. That means that the ordinate of the intersection point $(1,f(1))$ must be less than $5$, because $(-1,5)$ is the limit of this dotted line as it approaches $1$ from the left. Similarly, the ordinate of the intersection point $(1,f(1))$ must be greater than $8$, because $(2,8)$ is the limit of the dotted line as it approaches $1$ from the right.\n\n![strictly convex function through two points, with left-facing dotted line](https://i.imgur.com/7H9v5lV.png)\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $f(1)$ lies in the interval between the ordinates of the intersection points $(-1,f(-1))$, and $(1,f(1))$.\n\n$f(1)$ can take any value between $\\boxed{-8}$ and $\\boxed{1}$.",
