            "question": "How many arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers sum to 240?\n\n(A) 8\n(B) 12\n(C) 10\n(D) 4",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we can use the arithmetic series formula: S_n = (n/2) * (first term + last term), where S_n is the sum, n is the number of terms, and the arithmetic series is represented as s, s+d, s+2d, ..., s+(n-1)d, where s is the first term and d is the common difference.\n\nIn this case, the sum, S, is 240. We know that the terms are consecutive odd integers, so the first term will be odd and any subsequent terms will be odd as well, and differ by 2. We can use \"o\" to represent the odd integer s, and \"d\" to represent the common difference of 2.\n\nTo find s, we can evaluate the first few terms of the series: s+(s+2d),(s+s+2d),... until we find three terms that add up to s, and we can use any of them as our starting term.\n\nFor example: Let's try s=9. We find three terms that add up to s: 9, 15, 21. We use the formula: S_n = (n/2) * (first term + last term), S_3 = (3/2) * (9+21), S_3 is 30. Adding up, we get 9+15+21+30=75. Since this is not 240, we must have made a mistake. Let's double check:\n\nStarting term (s): 9\nCommon difference (d): 2\n\nNext Term : (s+d) = 11 s+(s+2d)= 15 (s+s+2d) = s+s+2d = 19 (s+2s+d) = s+s+2d = 23 (s+3s+d) = s+s+2d = 27 (s+4s+d) = s+s+2d = 31 (s+5s+d) = s+s+2d = 35 (s+6s+d) = s+s+2d = 39 (s+7s+d) = s+s+2d = 43 (s+8s+d) = s+s+2d = 47 (s+9s+d) = s+s+2d = 51 (s+10s+2d) = s+s+2d = 55 (s+11s+2d) = s+s+2d = 59 s+(s+2s+2d) = 30\n\nWe can see that three terms of s, s+d, and s+2d add up to S_3 = 30, and we can repeat the process for the next three terms. s+(s+2s+2d) = 33, s+(s+2s+2d) = 36, and s+(s+2s+2d) = 39. We find three terms that add up to s, and we can use any of them as our third term. We get three terms that add up to s, and we can use any of them as our starting term.\n\nS_3 is 30: S_3 + S_3 = 60, S_3 + S_3 = s, s+d, s+d, s+3d = S_n. s is 9, s+d is 11, s+d is 11, and s+3d is 19. Adding them up, we get S_n = (n/2) * (first term + last term) is 18 + 19 = 37. This is not 240. We made another mistake. Let's double check. s is 9, s+d is 11, s+d is 11, and s+3d is 19. Adding them up, we get S_n = S_3 + S_3 = 30+30 = 60. S_n + S_n = 120, but still not 240. If we double check, we find a mistake. We took three terms that add up to s, and added them up as if they were one term, which is incorrect.\n\nLet's try again:\n\nStarting term is: S s = 2, s+d = 3, s+2s+d = s+s+2d = 5, s+3s+d is skipped s+4s+d = s+s+2d = 7, (s+5s+d) is skipped s+6s+d is skipped s+7s+d = s+s+2d = 9, (s+8s+d) is skipped s+9s+d = s+s+2d = 11, s+10s+2d is skipped\n\nWe find three terms that add up to s: s, (s+2s+2d), and s+2s+2d. We use any three terms that add up to s, and we can use any three terms as our starting points. We get three terms that add up to s, and we can use any of them as our starting term.
