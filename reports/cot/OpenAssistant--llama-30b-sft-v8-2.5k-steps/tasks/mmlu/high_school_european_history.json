            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\nInterpret the question: The question asks about what Huxley argued \"life\" was based on the given passage.\n\nSkim the passage: I skimmed the passage to get a general idea of what Huxley is talking about. He is discussing the scientific concept of \"Protoplasm,\" which he refers to as the \"physical basis of life.\" Huxley notes that some people might find the idea of a physical basis for life novel, as they may view life as something that works through matter.\n\nIdentify key phrases: I identified several key phrases that relate to the question: \"physical basis,\" \"life,\" and \"works through matter.\"\n\nHighlight relevant information: I underlined the parts of the passage that directly relate to the question, including Huxley's statement that the material that makes up life breaks down into \"carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds,\" which are all matter with no special properties.\n\nSummarize the information: Based on the above steps, it seems that Huxley believed that \"life\" was not a force that works through matter, but rather a property of a certain kind of matter. He argues that the material that makes up life is matter with no special properties, and that the concept of a supernatural or philosophical notion of life is not supported by scientific evidence.\n\nAnswer the question: Based on the preceding steps, it seems that Huxley believed that \"life\" was merely a property of a certain kind of matter (option C).\n\n(C) Matter with no special properties.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) In ancient Rome, religious worship was decentralized and tended to vary with one's social position.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe quotation from Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire suggests that there were multiple modes of religious worship in ancient Rome, and that these modes were seen as equally true by the people, equally false by the philosophers, and equally useful by the magistrate. The fact that the religious modes were seen as equally true by the people suggests that there was not a strong centralized authority dictating religious beliefs. Additionally, the fact that the modes were seen as equally false by the philosophers and equally useful by the magistrate suggests that there was some level of variation in religious beliefs and practices among different social groups.\n\nGiven these observations, it is likely that religious worship in ancient Rome was decentralized and tended to vary with one's social position. It is possible that there were different religious beliefs and practices among different social classes or groups in ancient Rome, and that these beliefs and practices were not tightly controlled by a central authority. While it is possible that there may have been social tension or turmoil related to religious worship, the quotation does not explicitly mention this. It is also possible that the introduction of Christianity may have influenced religious worship in ancient Rome, but the quotation does not suggest that this was a major factor in the variability of religious worship.\n\nAnswers (B) and (C) are not supported by the quotation, which does not suggest that religious worship in ancient Rome was a major source of social tension or that it was highly centralized. Answer (D) is also not supported by the quotation, which does not suggest that Christianity played a significant role in shaping religious worship in ancient Rome.",

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.",

We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.
