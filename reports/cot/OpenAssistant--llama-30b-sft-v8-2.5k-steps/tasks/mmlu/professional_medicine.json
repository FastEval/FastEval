            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "The first step in determining the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is to consider her medical history. The patient had a pulmonary embolism that required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks, as well as a retroperitoneal hemorrhage and placement of an IVC filter. She also had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital. These factors suggest that the decreased sensation could be related to a complication of the IVC filter placement or the hematoma.\n\nThe next step is to consider the patient's current symptoms. The patient reports a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness in her left thigh that she had not reported in the hospital. This symptom has improved somewhat during the past week. The sensation is limited to a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh, which is consistent with compression of a peripheral nerve.\n\nThe examination findings also support the possibility of peripheral nerve compression. The patient has normal vital signs and no abnormalities of the skin. Muscle strength is normal, which rules out the possibility of a diagnosis such as polyneuropathy or myopathy. However, sensation to light touch is decreased over a specific area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. This is consistent with compression of a specific peripheral nerve, such as the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.\n\nGiven the patient's medical history, symptoms, and examination findings, the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (C). This nerve is commonly entrapped in the hip joint and can cause symptoms of numbness and tingling in the anterolateral thigh. It is possible that the IVC filter placement or the hematoma could have caused the nerve to be compressed or damaged, leading to the patient's symptoms. Further evaluation, such as a nerve conduction study, may be needed to confirm this diagnosis.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We know from the patient's gestation that she is at 39 weeks of pregnancy and is actively in labor.\n2. The patient had regular contractions every 4 minutes but is now having weaker, intermittent contractions.\n3. One possible explanation for the weaker contractions could be Braxton Hicks contractions, which are practice contractions that can occur throughout pregnancy but are typically more frequent and stronger during later stages. Braxton Hicks contractions are different from labor contractions because they are less frequent, but can occur at any time during pregnancy and are most common in the second or third trimester or after. As such, Braxton Hicks contractions cannot be ruled out of as a diagnosis.\n4. Another possibility for the weaker contractions is secondary amenorrhea, but this requires ruling out other potential diagnoses before reaching this diagnosis.\n5. Lower uterine ring contractions are another potential diagnosis, but this is typically caused by malpresentation of the fetus. The fact that the fetal head is engaged and the membranes are intact suggests that this is less likely.\n6. Hypotonic uterine dysfunction is another potential diagnosis, but this typically affects the tone and structure of the muscular tissue of the uterus. Therefore, it is less likely in this case.\n7. The last potential diagnosis, primary dysfunctional labor, requires further investigation and excludes other potential diagnoses, but this is more likely in this case.\n\nAnswer: D) primary dysfunctional labor.",

            "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of a low-grade fever, cough, and runny nose. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04). Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation of these study results?\n\n(A) The findings are clinically and statistically significant\n(B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant\n(C) The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant\n(D) The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant",

            "model_answer": "The most appropriate interpretation of these study results is (A) The findings are clinically and statistically significant.\n\nTwo-day history of runny noise and fever in a 5-year-old boy can be symptomatic of many diseases. An antibiotic would be used to treat a bacterial infection, but is not effective for a viral infection such as the common cold. As such, using a placebo is reasonable to compare to the new drug.\nThe placebo effect for a 5-year-old child with a cold could be significant, especially if a priori the child avoids placebo and his mother does not. The placebo effect, however, is likely not significantly stronger than the drug effect. It can be said that the child taking the drug has an average of 0.3 days shorter duration of symptoms than a child taking the placebo (6.4 days drug vs 6.7 days placebo). The p-value of 0.04 is less than 0.05, indicating statistical significance. The drug also had a statistically significant smaller duration of symptoms.  Both clinical and statistical significance are thus found.",

The options provided include:\n\nA) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor: This class of drugs inhibits the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which is involved in the formation of calcium carbonate stones. Therefore, it may be useful in preventing future kidney stones. However, this option does not directly address the cause of hypercalciuria.\nB) Na+ \u2013Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor: This class of drugs blocks the active transport of sodium and chloride ions, which could potentially decrease the reabsorption of calcium in the kidney and increase urinary calcium excretion. However, this option may also lead to other side effects and risks.\nC) Na+ \u2013K + \u20132Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor: This class of drugs is similar to the previous option, but it also blocks the reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions, which could potentially lead to electrolyte imbalances and other complications.\nD) Osmotic diuretic: This class of drugs increases urinary output by inhibiting the reabsorption of water and electrolytes in the kidney. However, it may not directly address the underlying cause of hypercalciuria.\n\nBased on these considerations, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient may depend on the specific cause of hypercalciuria. However, without more information, it may be difficult to determine the most appropriate option.
