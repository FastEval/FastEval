            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "First, let's list the potential causes for the patient's decreased sensation:\n\n* Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n* Complication of the IVC filter placement\n* Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n* Hematoma of the left thigh\n\nNone of these appear to be caused by a hematoma, as this has already been described and resolved. Therefore, (D) Hematoma of the left thigh is most likely not the cause of the patient's persistent tingling and numbness.\n\nNext, cerebral infarction (A) is considered, which is a blockage in blood supply to the brain. However, this is most likely caused by a hematoma, which this patient has already experienced and resolved. Therefore, cerebral infarction as a cause for the patient's current symptoms seems unlikely.\n\nCompression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (C) is a common cause of tingling and numbness in the lateral left thigh. This nerve passes through the left hip, and could potentially be compressed by a retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which the patient experienced. Therefore, option (C) is a likely cause for the patient's symptoms.\n\nAn IVC filter (B) is a device inserted into the inferior vena cava to prevent pulmonary embolisms, which is the reason for the patient's initial hospitalization. There is no clear evidence to suggest that the device, by itself, would cause tingling or numbness in the thigh. Therefore, option (B) is less likely as a cause for the patient's symptoms.\n\nIn summary, based on the given description of the patient's symptoms and medical history, option (C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve appears to be the most likely cause for the patient's decreased sensation.",

She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Answer: (A) Median nerve at the wrist.\n\nThe numbness and tingling in the right hand, especially in the right ring and small fingers, are symptoms of nerve damage. The median nerve is responsible for providing sensation to the thumb, index finger, long finger, and half of the fourth finger. This nerve is most likely being compressed or squeezed somewhere along its path, leading to the symptoms described.\n\nSo, we need to consider where the median nerve travels and see if there is a possibility of the nerve being compressed at any of those sites.\n\nThe most likely cause of the symptoms is entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist, specifically at the carpal tunnel. The median nerve passes through the carpal tunnel, which is a narrow passageway in the wrist formed by bones and a tough band of tissue called the flexor retinaculum. This tunnel can become narrowed if there is swelling or inflammation around the nerve, or if the nerve becomes trapped due to repetitive use of the hand or wrist, such as using a computer keyboard or playing softball.\n\nAnother possibility is compression of the nerve in the forearm. The musculocutaneous nerve is the nerve most likely to be compressed at this site. However, the symptoms are more likely to be in the muscular region of the forearm and would not cause the kind of numbness described.\n\nThe radial and ulnar nerves can also be compressed in the forearm, but again, the symptoms would not be consistent with the numbness described.\n\nIn conclusion, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist. This can cause decreased sensation to the fingers and lead to the tingling and numbness described.",

Based on the location of the tongue, the lymph nodes to be considered are the deep cervical group, the parotid group, the retropharyngeal group, and the submental group.\n3.
