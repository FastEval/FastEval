            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(A) r = k ln[A]\n\nExplanation:\n\n* A zero-order chemical reaction is a reaction in which the rate (r) is independent of the concentration (a) of the reactants.\n* In other words, the rate of the reaction is constant for the entire reaction and does not depend on the initial concentration of the reactants.\n* The rate law for a zero-order reaction (also known as the integrated rate law) can be expressed as:\n\n    `d[A]/dt = k` (where [A] is the concentration of the reactant A and t is the time)\n\n* We can rearrange the equation to solve for rate (r) as follows:\n\n    `r = k` (where k is a constant and r is the rate)\n\n* To determine the rate law, we can measure the rate (r) of the reaction as a function of concentration (a), and then express r in terms of a.\n* Option (A) provides the answer to the question by showing that the rate (r) of a zero-order chemical reaction can be expressed as r = k `ln[A]`.\n\nFinal line with answer:\n\n(A)",

Once we have written the equation in this form, we can see that the coefficients of the species A, B, and C on the left-hand side must be equal to the coefficients of the species D, E, and F on the right-hand side.\n\nLet's start by identifying the species in the equation:\n\nMnO4\u2212 + I\u2212 + H+ -> Mn2+ + IO3\u2212 + H2O\n\nA = MnO4\u2212\nB = I\u2212\nC = H+\nD = Mn2+\nE = IO3\u2212\nF = H2O\n\nNow we can rearrange the equation in the form stated above:\n\nMnO4\u2212 + I\u2212 + H+ + x IO3\u2212 + y H2O <=> Mn2+ + x IO3\u2212 + y H2O + z H2O\n\nwhere x, y, and z are coefficients that we need to determine.\n\nTo balance the equation, we need to set the coefficients of A, B, and C on the left-hand side equal to the coefficients of D, E, and F on the right-hand side. We can start by setting the coefficients of A and D equal:\n\n1 x IO3\u2212 + y H2O + z H2O\n\nSince we want the coefficient of Mn2+ on the right-hand side to match the coefficient of MnO4\u2212 on the left-hand side, we can set the coefficient of D equal to one-third of the coefficient of A:\n\nMnO4\u2212 + 3 I\u2212 + H+ + x IO3\u2212 + y H2O <=> Mn2+ + x IO3\u2212 + y H2O + z H2O\n\nNow we can set the coefficients of B and E equal:\n\n1 x IO3\u2212 + y H2O + z H2O\n\nWe can do this by setting the coefficient of E equal to three times the coefficient of B:\n\nMnO4\u2212 + 3 I\u2212 + H+ + x IO3\u2212 + y H2O <=> Mn2+ + 3 x IO3\u2212 + y H2O + z H2O\n\nWe see that the coefficients of A, D, and E are now equal to one, while the coefficient of B is one-third of the coefficient of A.
