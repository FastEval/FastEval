            "model_answer": "The potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter because it uses a centre zero galvanometer instead of a voltmeter (C). The use of a centre zero galvanometer, which has a null point in the centre, enables the measurement to be more accurate as it allows for any errors in the voltage being measured to be seen and recorded, while a voltmeter without a null point would not be able to record such errors. Due to the construction of the centre zero galvanometer, it is not affected by the load of the circuit, unlike a voltmeter, and therefore can provide more accurate measurements.",

Finally, when making a `AND` gate we must use gates `!(A),(B),(C),(Z),(D)` as variables `E=AND(NOT_A,NOT_B,NOT_C,NOT_Z,Not_D)` , which means that `E` contains all lines of gates `B` and `C`.

The source voltage is given by the equation 400 sin(314 t).\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the range of firing angle control for a load counter emf of 200 V.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the expression for the source voltage by rewriting it as 400 sin(6.28 t), where 314 is the constant used to avoid writing pi (\u03c0) in the formula.\n\nThe firing angle is the angle between the direction of the applied voltage to the secondary winding of a transformer and the direction of the induced voltage in the secondary winding. In this case, there is only one winding, which is the load, so the firing angle control is the angle between the direction of the applied voltage on the load and the direction of the load counter emf.\n\nNext, we need to determine which option is the correct answer. Options (A), (B), (C), and (D) each give a different answer, and we need to see which one satisfies the given conditions.\n\nRecall that the problem question is  for a load counter emf of 200 V, the range of firing angle control is. So, we need to solve for the range of firing angle that is consistent with a load counter emf of 200 V.\n\nWe can start by finding the equation for the load counter emf. This will give us an equation we can use to solve for the firing angle.\n\nRecall that the equation for the counter emf is:\n\nE = -Nd\\(\"@\")B\n\nwhere E is the counter emf, t is time, and d is a constant of proportionality (related to core cross-sectional area). If we assume that the load itself is a simple resistor, we can assume that the counter emf is equal to the load voltage.\n\nThe given equation for the source voltage is 400 sin(6.28 t).

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Firstly, we need to understand what a dynamometer wattmeter is and how it works. A dynamometer wattmeter is a device used to measure the amount of electrical power being consumed by a circuit. It works by using a moving coil of wire that is suspended in a magnetic field. The coil is connected to two springs, one on either side, which cause the coil to move back and forth as the current flows through it. This movement is then translated into a mechanical reading that indicates the amount of power being consumed.\n\nGiven this information, we can determine that the resistance in the circuit of the moving coil of a dynamometer wattmeter should be (D) Almost zero. The reason for this is that the resistance of the coil itself should be very low, so that it can easily move back and forth in the magnetic field without any significant resistance. A high resistance in the coil would make it more difficult for the coil to move, and this would affect the accuracy of the measurement being taken by the wattmeter. Therefore, the resistance in the circuit should be as low as possible, and option (D) is the correct answer.",

            "model_answer": "To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of directional heating. Directional heating is a process in which heat is only allowed to flow in one direction. In order to achieve this, we need to use a material that has good thermal conductivity in the direction of heat flow, and poor thermal conductivity in the opposite direction. \n\nOne material that is commonly used for directional heating is gas-filleduchloride (GeCH). GeCH has good thermal conductivity along its length, but poor thermal conductivity across its width. This makes it an ideal material for use in directional heating applications. \n\nSince GeCH has good thermal conductivity along its length, we can use it to create a heat sink for electronic components. By placing a GeCH heatsink in contact with an electronic component, we can allow heat to flow into the heatsink along its length, and out into the surrounding air. This helps to dissipate heat away from the component, preventing it from overheating.\n\nHowever, in order to achieve directional heating, we need to apply a voltage across the GeCH heatsink. This voltage will vary depending on the material properties of the GeCH. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct answer based solely on the information provided in the question.\n\nAnswer: (E) The normal voltage used in directional heating depends on the material properties of the GeCH heatsink.",

We need to figure out the range of frequencies that LC oscillators can produce.\n\nStep 2: Let's look at each option and eliminate the ones that are definitely too low or too high. Option (A) is out since it's lower than the minimum range we want. Option (D) is out because it's much higher than the maximum range we're looking for.\n\nStep 3: We're left with options (B) and (C). We need more information to determine which one is correct.\n\nStep 4: Let's think about how LC oscillators work. They are based on the behavior of an oscillating circuit that consists of an inductor (L) and a capacitor (C). The oscillation frequency depends on the values of L and C, as well as the\u015bci required for oscillation. The higher the frequency, the smaller the required swing in voltage becomesee.\n\nStep 5: Now, let's use this information to eliminate one of the remaining options. Option (C) says that LC oscillators can only produce frequencies between 1 kHz and 1 MHz. But we know that LC oscillators can operate at much higher frequencies - for example, in radio-frequency applications where they are used for local oscillators in receiver circuits, or in VCOs used in FM radio transmitters. So option (C) can be eliminated.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 100 KHz to 500 MHz. LC oscillators can produce frequency ranging from hundred kilohertz to five hundred megahertz. This is a wide range of frequencies that they can cover partially because of the scalability of the technology.\n\nAnswer: (B) 100 KHz to 500 MHz",
