            "question": "Maine's famous aphorism that 'the movement of progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract' is often misunderstood. In what way?\n\n(A) It is misinterpreted as a prediction.\n(B) His concept of status is misrepresented.\n(C) It is taken literally.\n(D) His idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(D) His idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems.\n\nA, B, and C have the following reasoning:\n\nA: The statement appears to have been made with confidence, but its use of \"progressive\" and \"movement\" may have been intended to mean something closer to \"movement has been\" or \"movement has gone\". It is thus equally possible that Maine was saying something about the past as that he was making a prediction about the future.\n\nB: Maine likely understood \"status\" as determined by social position rather than by adherence to morality. His \"contract\" was likely understood less as a legal contract than as \"what the parties thereto agreed to\".\n\nC: The phrase \"Status to Contract\" may have been intended as a metaphor, but its meaning would therefore depend on what exactly was meant by \"Status\" and by \"Contract\".\n\nTaking these together, option (C) \"It is taken literally\" is less likely than option (D). \"Status\" likely includes \"standing\" or \"pre-eminence\" and contrasts with morality. \"Contract\" was likely understood without reference to its legal form. Taken together, Maine's concept therefore contrasts \"what one can get away with\" with \"what one has agreed to\".\n\nIn light of this, option (D) is right. While a modern reader might therefore contrast \"status\" with \"contracted away\", or perhaps even \"requested\" or \"surmised\", this understanding may well be anachronistic. It may instead reflect contrast between \"what one can get away with\" and \"what one has agreed to\" and contrast between \"what one can get away with\" and \"what is right\".\n\n(D) His idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) The international recognition of human rights after World War II.\n\nReasons:\n\n1. The revival of natural law in the 20th century is discussed.\n2. Four factors are presented as possible contributors to this revival. These are:\n   a. The Depression of the 1930s.\n   b. The rise of Fascism.\n   c. The international recognition of human rights after World War II.\n   d. The Bolshevik Revolution.\n3. Factor (A) and (B) may have had negative impacts on the development of natural law, as the Depression and Fascism could have led to a breakdown of social and economic order.\n4. Factor (D) could have also contributed to the revival of natural law, as the need for a set of universal principles to govern the behavior of individuals and states may have increased in the aftermath of World War I.\n5. Factor (C) stands out as the most likely contributor to the revival of natural law in the 20th century, as the international recognition of human rights after World War II provided a strong basis for the development and promotion of natural law principles.\n6. The answer, therefore, is (C) The international recognition of human rights after World War II.",

This statement suggests that every command necessarily includes a sanction, which contradicts Austin's view that a sanction is the smallest possible evil associated with the smallest possible chance of occurrence.\n\nThe second statement, (B) The concept of a command contains the likelihood that a sanction will follow failure to obey the command, is also inconsistent with Austin's view because it suggests that the likelihood of a sanction is part of the definition of a command, and Austin's definition emphasizes the minimization of the evil associated with the sanction.\n\nThe third statement, (C) Without a sanction the mere expression of a wish is not a command, is closer to Austin's view because it implies that something beyond a mere expression of a wish is needed for an action to be considered a command. However, it still does not address the minimization of evil and the avoidance of unnecessary suffering, which are central to Austin's definition of a sanction.\n\nFinally, (D) A command confers power to change one's legal status is the least likely to follow logically from Austin's argument because it suggests that a command is tied to a specific legal status, rather than being focused on minimizing the evil associated with a potential sanction.
