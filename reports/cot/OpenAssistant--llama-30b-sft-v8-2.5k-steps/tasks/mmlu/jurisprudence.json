'Being obliged' refers to the moment when an individual is subject to a moral or natural duty, whereas 'having an obligation' refers to the moment when an individual is subject to a legal duty. By making this distinction, Hart sought to explain the nature of legal rules and the way in which they shape and regulate behavior.\n\nIn other words, by illuminating the concept of a rule, Hart was able to provide a clearer understanding of the relationship between law and morality, and the way in which legal rules function in society. This distinction is an important tool for legal theorists, and it has been used to explore a wide range of legal issues, from the nature of legal obligations to the idea of legal authority.",

According to the passage, Austin's argument is that \"a sanction consists of the smallest [evil] that will be accepted by aurera [i.e. the potential violator] as a reason for complying with.\" In other words, Austin defines a sanction as the minimum amount of harm that is necessary to ensure compliance with a command.\n\nGiven this definition, it is reasonable to infer that Austin would argue that:\n\n* All commands need some form of sanction, otherwise there would be no incentive for someone to comply with the command.\n* The concept of a command necessarily includes the possibility of a sanction, as the sanction is an essential part of the command.\n* Without a sanction, a merely expressing a wish cannot be considered a command, as there is no incentive for someone to comply with the wish.\n* A command can confer power to change one's legal status, but this is not an inherent part of the definition of a sanction.\n\nTherefore, the option that is least likely to follow logically from Austin's argument is (D), as it does not necessarily require the presence of a sanction.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The \"England problem\" refers to a difficulty in understanding the paradoxical coexistence of political and legal institutions in England that appear to be authoritarian or even absolutist, with aln1ost no limits to the power of the monarch, together with economic institutions that seem to be very liberal and capitalist, with a high degree of economic freedom. Weber's solution to the England problem is to recognize the importance of legitimate domination. Legitimate domination refers to a form of political domination that is seen as legitimate by the population and is supported by a sense of duty or obligation. Legitimate domination can exist even in the absence of democratic institutions or political freedoms. Legitimate domination is what allowed the coexistence of authoritarian political institutions and liberal economic institutions in England. Legitimate domination is enabled by the presence of certain values or beliefs, such as a belief in the divine right of kings or a belief in the efficiency and rationality of market principles. These values and beliefs can be shaped by cultural, historical, religious, and other factors. The answer to the England problem is therefore to recognize that political institutions can coexist with different economic institutions if there is a form of legitimate domination that supports them. The answer is therefore (D): By recognizing the importance of legitimate domination.",

Only if we use our reason can we determine what is truly in accordance with the natural law, as opposed to what is merely based on human custom or convention.\n\nReason allows us to discern the fundamental principles of natural law, such as the concept of justice, from the particular laws of individual societies. It also allows us to recognize that there may be different ways of applying these principles in different contexts, depending on the specific circumstances.\n\nTherefore, natural law is not something that can be determined simply by following rules or tradition, but rather requires the use of reason to determine what is truly in accordance with the principles of nature.
