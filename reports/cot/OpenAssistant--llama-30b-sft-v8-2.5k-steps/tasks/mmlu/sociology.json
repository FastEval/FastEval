            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what the question is asking. It is asking for the opinion of Becker on cannabis use in the 1970s.\n\nNext, we need to look at the given options and see which one best matches Becker's opinion.\n\nOption (A) states that cannabis use was increasing throughout all sections of youth in the 1970s. This option does not necessarily match Becker's opinion, as he may have different views on whether cannabis use was increasing.\n\nOption (B) states that cannabis use was learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career. This option is not directly related to cannabis use in the 1970s, but it does mention social processes and deviant behavior, which could be related to Becker's views.\n\nOption (C) states that cannabis use was a dangerous pastime that young people should not be allowed to pursue. This option directly contradicts Becker's view, as he believed that cannabis use could be beneficial under certain circumstances.\n\nOption (D) states that cannabis use was not as enjoyable as other sociologists had suggested. This option does not necessarily match Becker's opinion, as he may have had different views on the enjoyment of cannabis use.\n\nTherefore, based on the given options, we cannot determine with certainty what Becker's opinion on cannabis use in the 1970s was. However, Becker was known for his support of the use of marijuana in a controlled and researched environment For this reason, option (B) is not the answer, as his views spoke more of the risks itposed in terms of being a deviant career than a positive thought about it's benefits.",

            "question": "The middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century were:\n\n(A) an urban set, involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations\n(B) too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness\n(C) often involved in 'white collar' work\n(D) all of the above",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(B) too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness.\n\n2. What is the reasoning behind this answer?\n\nThe middle classes of the nineteenth century were a diverse group of people with varying interests and occupations. This made it difficult for them to form a strong sense of class consciousness, as they did not have a unifying identity or set of interests. Some members of the middle class may have been involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations, but this was not a defining characteristic of the entire group. Additionally, \"white collar\" work was not necessarily exclusive to the middle class, as working-class individuals may have also held similar positions. Therefore, option (B) is the best explanation for why the middle classes of the nineteenth century did not have a strong sense of class consciousness.\n\n3. Can you provide an example to illustrate your point?\n\nFor example, imagine a city in the nineteenth century with a diverse middle class that includes small business owners, factory managers, lawyers, doctors, and teachers. While these individuals may share some common characteristics, such as their position within the economic hierarchy and their education level, they also have distinct interests and priorities. The small business owner may be more focused on networking and improving their local business, while the factory manager may be more concerned with managing their workforce and expanding their production. The lawyer may be involved in local politics, while the doctor may be more focused on advancing their medical knowledge. These different interests and priorities make it difficult for them to come together and create a strong sense of class consciousness.",

            "model_answer": "The concept of gemeinschaft, developed by Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies, describes a social group that is characterized by a sense of belonging, mutual support, and shared values. This type of community is often found in rural areas, where people know each other and have close relationships. The term \"gemeinschaft\" is German for \"community\" or \"community spirit.\"\n\nThe concept of gemeinschaft is similar to \"organic solidarity,\" which is a term coined by \u00c9mile Durkheim to describe a social order characterized by interdependence and integration based on shared values and mutual support. Durkheim believed that organic solidarity was characteristic of traditional societies, such as those found in rural areas.\n\nOn the other hand, \"mechanical solidarity\" is a term used by Durkheim to describe a social order characterized by interdependence and integration based on functional roles and the division of labor. Durkheim believed that mechanical solidarity was characteristic of modern societies, such as those found in urban areas.\n\n\"Gesellschaft,\" which is German for \"society\" or \"community,\" is a generic term that refers to a group of individuals who share a common geographic location or cultural background, but may not necessarily have close relationships or shared values.\n\n\" Anomie\" is a term used by \u00c9mile Durkheim to describe the feeling of normlessness and instability that results from a breakdown of social cohesion and the breakdown of shared values and norms.\n\nTherefore, the concept of gemeinschaft developed by Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies describes basically the same relational characteristic as \"organic solidarity.\" \n\nThe answer is C) gesellschaft, which is a developing community with scarce social links.\n\nSorry, as ho understand your question.

            "model_answer": "If a deviant act is 'normalized', it is:\n\n(A) recognised as breaking an important norm of behaviour.\n\nFirst, let's look at the definition of \"normalization.\" According to the Oxford dictionary, \"normalization\" refers to the process of making something normal or neutral. When applied to deviant behavior, \"normalization\" means that the behavior is no longer viewed as deviant, but instead considered normal or acceptable.\n\nNow, let's look at the options given. Option A states that normalization is \"recognized as breaking an important norm of behavior.\" This option describes the opposite of normalization- viewing the behavior as deviant and breaking an important norm. Therefore, this option is not a correct answer.\n\nOption B states that normalization is seen as a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character. This option describes a behavior that is not considered normal over time but rather as a temporary lapse in character. Since it describes something other than stable normalization this option can also be discarded.\n\nOption C states that the normalization is the first step in establishing a deviant career. This option implies that normalization is the act that preceeds deviancy- not the other way around. because this option is not logically correct, it also cannot be the correct answer.\n\nOption D states that normalization is attributed to the person's genetic or anatomical make up. This option describes that deviancy is derived from a person's makeup- which stands separately than the socially constructed concept of normalization. Therefore, option D is also incorrect.\n\n(B) seen a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character",

Patriarchy is a social system in which men have more power and privilege than women.\n\nSecond, we need to examine the different ways that Marxist feminists explain the origins of patriarchy.\n\nThird, we can see that option (A) refers to a lack of equal rights and opportunities for men and women, but this does not fully explain the existence and maintenance of patriarchy over time.\n\nFourth, option (B) mentions sex classes and the oppression of women by men, which is a more nuanced explanation that recognizes the role of power dynamics between the sexes. However, it does not fully account for the economic aspects of patriarchy.\n\nFifth, option (C) highlights the exploitation of women's domestic labor in the capitalist economy, which is another important factor in the maintenance of patriarchy. This option acknowledges the economic aspects of patriarchy.\n\nSixth, option (D) refers to the dual systems of capitalism and male domination, which suggests that patriarchy is closely linked to the economic system and that the two systems reinforce each other. This option provides a comprehensive explanation of patriarchy by recognizing the intersections of gender, class, and power.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct answer is (D).",
