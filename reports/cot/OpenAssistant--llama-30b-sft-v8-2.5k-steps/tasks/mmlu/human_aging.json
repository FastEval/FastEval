            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) Aerobic exercise.\n\nReasoning:\n\n* Memory is a cognitive function that involves the ability to learn and retain information.\n* There are multiple factors that can influence memory, including physical exercise, dietary supplements, and social interactions.\n* Let's analyze each option:\n\t+ (A) Aerobic exercise: Studies have shown that regular physical activity, especially aerobic exercise, can improve cognitive function and memory. Exercise regulates blood flow to the brain, promotes the growth of new neurons, and stimulates the release of neurotransmitters that support learning and memory.\n\t+ (B) Taking acetylcholine: Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in memory and cognition. While some supplements that increase acetylcholine levels may enhance memory, there is not enough evidence to support the use of specific dietary supplements for memory improvement.\n\t+ (C) Taking gingko: Ginkgo biloba is a popular herbal supplement that contains flavonoids and terpenoids, which are believed to improve cerebral blood flow and protect against oxidative stress. While some studies suggest that gingko may benefit cognitive function in older individuals, results are mixed and further research is needed.\n\t+ (D) Increasing social contacts: Social interactions are important for cognitive stimulation and emotional well-being. They can also lead to the formation of new memories and enhance social memory retrieval. However, while social interactions may contribute to overall cognitive health, there is no direct causal relationship between social contacts and normal memory improvement.\n\nAnswer: Based on the above reasoning, the correct answer is (A) Aerobic exercise.",
