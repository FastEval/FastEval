            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Here's my thinking:\n\n1. Don't know anything about Retail Merchants and chamber of commerce, let's look at them later.\n2. Dun & Bradstreet is interesting, let's try that first. It does give trade credit reports and rating of companies and in principle also retail companies can be rated. But I'm not sure if they focus much on retail, certainly not in their name. So let's look at a similarly sounding alternative:\n3. What about United States Retail Credit Association? It's a credit bureau for the retail industry and let me guess: also gives ratings for the retail industry. Sounds like this could be it. In fact the full name also contains the word \"Association\", so it meets the last part of the criteria.\n\nSo the answer must be (D) the United States Retail Credit Association.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Paper will burn at around 451 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. To solve this problem, we need to use our knowledge of combustion temperature. Combustion is the chemical reaction between a fuel and an oxidizer that results in the release of energy. The temperature at which a material will ignite and burn is called its combustion temperature.\n2. The four given options (A), (B), (C), and (D) are all different temperature values and we need to determine which one is the combustion temperature of paper.\n3. Combustion temperatures vary for different substances. For example, the combustion temperature of wood is around 398 degrees Fahrenheit, while the combustion temperature of gasoline is around 495 degrees Fahrenheit.\n4. Paper is composed of cellulose, which is a reactive compound that can undergo combustion reactions. The combustion temperature of paper is around 451 degrees Fahrenheit, which is option D.\n5. Some paper products may have other additives or coatings that could alter their combustion temperature. However, for pure cellulose paper, the combustion temperature is around 451 degrees Fahrenheit.\n6. Therefore, the answer is (D) 451 degrees Fahrenheit.",
