            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Answer (D): 451 degrees.\n\nExplanation:\n\nPaper consists primarily of cellulose, a crystalline polymer that is hydrophilic, meaning it has a strong affinity for water. When paper is heated, the water molecules evaporate, and the cellulose chains can move more freely and bind to one another. This causes the paper to become brittle, reducing its integrity and leading to its eventual decomposition. As the temperature increases, the chemical bonds within the cellulose are broken, and the polymer starts to decompose into simpler compounds such as carbon dioxide and water.\n\nThe melting point of cellulose is approximately 446-456 \u00b0F (220-235 \u00b0C). When the paper reaches this temperature, the cellulose chains are broken down, and the paper is no longer recognizable as such. Instead, it becomes charred, turning into a black, carbonaceous material. This is also the temperature at which the paper begins to release flammable gases and extinguishes the flame, indicating that the paper has combusted.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 451 degrees, which represents the temperature range during which paper undergoes combustion and becomes charred.",

(A) Morgan and Mason seems to be way off, as Morgan and Mason were the captains of the USS Essex during the War of 1812. (C) Cabot and Joseph also seems unlikely, as Cabot and Joseph were explorers of the New World in the 1400s. This leaves us with (B) Meriwether and William, who were appointed by President Jefferson to lead an expedition from St. Louis to the Pacific Ocean, so they are more likely to be the early American explorers being referred to in the question.\nStep 3: Confirm the accuracy of (B) Meriwether and William by looking them up online or in a book, just to be sure.\nStep 4: Provide the final answer as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else, as requested.

This implies that the approach is hands-on and interactive, with the teacher guiding the students in their reading.\n* Direct instruction typically involves a teacher lecturing or presenting information to students, while literature circle is a student-led approach where students discuss a text in a group. Read-aloud is a teacher-led approach where the teacher reads to the class while students listen. None of these approaches match the description provided in the prompt.\n\nTherefore, the approach that best fits the description provided in the prompt is guided reading.
