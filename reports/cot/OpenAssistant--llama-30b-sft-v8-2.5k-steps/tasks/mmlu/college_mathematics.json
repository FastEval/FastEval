First, we need to determine the dimension of the domain P of the operator D, which is the space of all polynomials with coefficients in Z5 and degree less than or equal to 7.\n\n2. To find the dimension of P, we can use the fact that the dimension of a vector space is equal to the number of basis vectors it has. We can choose a basis for P in the form of{1,x,x^2,x^3,x^4,x^5,x^6}, which consists of the constant polynomial and the seven monomials of degree less than or equal to 6.\n\n3. The dimension of the domain P is therefore 8.\n\n4. Next, we need to determine the range of D, which is the set of all derivative functions that can be obtained by applying D to all possible elements of P.\n\n5.
