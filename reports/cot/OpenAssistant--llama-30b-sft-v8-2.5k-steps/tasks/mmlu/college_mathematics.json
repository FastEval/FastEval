Therefore, the dimension of the null space of D plus the dimension of the range of D is equal to the dimension of the set of constant polynomials.\n\nNow we need to find a linear basis for the set of constant polynomials. We can express any constant polynomial as a multiple of p(x) = 1. Hence, the set of constant polynomials is {k * 1 | k is an element of Z_5}. The number of elements in this set is equal to the order of Z_5, which is 4.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the null space of D plus the dimension of the range of D is equal to 4.\n\nNow we need to find the dimension of the range of D. Since the degree of a polynomial is less than or equal to 7, the derivative of a polynomial is of degree less than or equal to 6. Therefore, the range of D is the set of polynomials with coefficients in Z_5 and degree less than or equal to 6.\n\nUsing the basis {1, x, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5} of P, we can find the dimension of R by counting the number of linearly independent vectors in the set {p'(x) | p(x) is an element of the basis}. The first few derivatives are:\n\nD(1) = 0'\nD(x) = 1'\nD(x^2) = 2x'\nD(x^3) = 3x^2'\nD(x^4) = 4x^3'\nD(x^5) = 5x^4'.\n\nWe can see that after taking the fourth derivative, all the derivatives are linear combinations of each other. Therefore, the dimension of the range of D is 6.\n\nFinally, we use the Rank-Nullity theorem to find the dimensions of the null space and the range of D. Since the dimension of the null space of D plus the dimension of the range of D is 4, the dimension of the range of D must be 6. The only answer that matches this requirement is (A).\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the null space of D and the range of D are n = 1 and r = 6.",

Assuming the ladder is made of steel with a density of 7850 kg/m^3, the mass of the ladder would be:\n\nm = 9 * 7850\n= 68,650 kg\n\nNext, we can calculate the angle between the ladder and the horizontal ground:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = height/length\n\nwhere height is the distance between the bottom end of the ladder and the ground. Assuming the ground is level, the height would be:\n\nheight = 9 - x\n\nwhere x is the distance between the bottom end of the ladder and the wall. We know that x varies from 0 to 9, and that the bottom end has a constant velocity of 2 meters per second. Therefore:\n\ndx/dt = 2\n\nwhere t is time and x is in meters. Integrating this equation from x=0 to x=3, we get:\n\nx = 3\n3 = 2t + C\nC = 1\n\nSo x is 3 meters, and the height is:\n\nheight = 9 - 3\n= 6 meters\n\nUsing this value and the ladder's length, the angle \u03b8 can be calculated as:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = height/length\n= 6/9\n= 0.666\n\nNow that we know the mass and the angle, we can calculate the force applied to the ladder:\n\np = m * g * sin(\u03b8)\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\np = 68,650 * 9.8 * 0.666\n= 54,300 N\n\nFinally, we can use the formula for velocity to figure out how fast the top end of the ladder is sliding downward:\n\nv = p/m\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nv = 54,300/68,650\n= 0.8*sqrt2\n\nSo the answer is (B) 6*sqrt(2).",
