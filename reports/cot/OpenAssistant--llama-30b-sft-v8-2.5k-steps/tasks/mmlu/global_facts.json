            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Let's approach this question step-by-step:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the key pieces of information. We need to calculate the percentage of adults over the age of 18 who were overweight in 2016. Overweight is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher, which is approximately equal to a weight of 117 pounds or more for a woman of average height, and 160 pounds or more for a man of average height. This information is not related to the answer directly, but it's useful to know the definition of overweight for this question.\n2. The next step is to find the number of adults in the US in 2016. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the estimated population of the United States in 2016 was about 324.3 million people.\n3. We also need to find the number of adults aged 18 years or older in the US in 2016. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that there were approximately 249.6 million adults aged 18 years or older in the United States in 2016.\n4. Now that we know the number of adults in the US in 2016, we need to find the number of overweight adults. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 70.7% of adults in the United States were overweight or obese in 2017-2018. This figure includes adults with a BMI of 25 or higher, as well as those with a BMI of 30 or higher (obese). The question asks about overweight adults specifically, so we need to subtract the percentage of adults who were obese (the portion of 70.7% that exceeded a BMI of 30).\n5. According to the CDC, approximately 24.0% of adults in the United States were classified as obese in 2017-2018. To find the percentage of adults who were overweight but not obese, we can subtract this percentage from 70.7%.\n6. The percentage of adults who were overweight but not obese is 70.7% - 24.0% = 46.7%.\n7. Finally, we can calculate the percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who were overweight in 2016: 46.7% of 249.6 million adults is approximately equal to 117.2 million adults. This figure represents the number of adults who were overweight according to the definition provided.\n8. We now have the final result: the percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who were overweight in 2016 is approximately 46.7%.\n9. The answer is: (D) 80%.",

            "question": "What was GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 when adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices?\n\n(A) About $300\n(B) About $3k\n(C) About $8k\n(D) About $15k",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "\u200b\n\nIn order to answer this question, we need to adjust GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 to account for inflation and PPP (purchasing power parity) in 2011 prices. To do this, we will use data from two sources: the US Census bureau for GDP per capita in 1850 and from an economics textbook for GDP per capita in 2011 (which is the year we will adjust to).\n\nStep 1: Find GDP per capita in the United States in 1850. According to the US Census bureau, GDP per capita in 1850 was $930.\n\nStep 2: Find GDP per capita in the United States in 2011. According to an economics textbook, GDP per capita in 2011 was $46,000 (in current US dollars).\n\nStep 3: Adjust GDP per capita in 1850 for inflation. We will use the CPI (consumer price index) to adjust GDP per capita in 1850 for inflation to 2011 prices. The CPI in 1850 was 9.1 and the CPI in 2011 was 222.9. If we divide GDP per capita in 1850 by the CPI in 1850 and then multiply by the CPI in 2011, we get $36,060 (in current US dollars).\n\nStep 4: Adjust GDP per capita in 2011 for PPP. We will use PPP to adjust GDP per capita in 2011 to account for differences in the cost of goods and services between countries. According to the World Bank, the PPP conversion factor for 2011 is .739. If we divide GDP per capita in 2011 by the PPP conversion factor for 2011, we get $26,081.\n\nStep 5: Find GDP per capita in 2011 (PPP adjusted) for the United States in 1850. If we multiply GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 (adjusted for inflation) by the PPP conversion factor for 2011, we get $18,402.\n\nAnswer: (C) About $8k.",

This is a process that takes into account differences in the cost of goods and services in different countries when comparing GDP figures, rather than simply using exchange rates.\n\nThe question also mentions \"inflation\", which is the rate of increase in the general price level for goods and services in an economy. This can affect the absolute value of GDP figures, and should also be taken into account when comparing GDP over time.\n\nOnce these factors have been adjusted for, we can calculate the increase in GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016 in Japan.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is not clear that the GDP per capita increased over this period Macroaxis. Most GDP per capita tends to increase over time as the economy grows, so the correct answer would be (A) by 5 fold or (B) by 10 fold.",

The Global Corruption Barometer, published by Transparency International, is a commonly used source for this information.\n\n2. Find the relevant question in the data. The data may contain multiple questions related to bribery or public services, so we need to identify the specific question that corresponds to the one in the query. We might look for questions about the respondents' experience paying bribes for access to various public services.\n\n3. Calculate the percentage of respondents reporting bribery. Once we have identified the relevant question, we can find the percentage of respondents who answer \"yes\" to whether they have paid a bribe in the past year, and divide it by the number of respondents. We can then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n4. Round the percentage to the nearest whole number. Percentages can have up to two decimal places, so we can round the result to the nearest whole number (integer).\n\nAnswer:\n(C) 69%",
