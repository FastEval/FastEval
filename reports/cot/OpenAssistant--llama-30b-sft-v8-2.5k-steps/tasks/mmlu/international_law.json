            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We are asked about which State ordinarily exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels.\n2. To answer this question, we need to determine which State has the authority to investigate and prosecute crimes committed on board ships or vessels.\n3. There are four options: The coastal State, the flag State, all States enjoy such jurisdiction, or the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.\n4. The coastal State is the State whose coastline is adjacent to the area where the crime took place. In this case, we are concerned with crimes committed on board vessels, and therefore the coastal State is unlikely to have jurisdiction.\n5. The flag State is the State whose flag the vessel flies. In other words, it is the State where the vessel is registered. It is possible that the flag State could have jurisdiction over crimes committed on board its vessels.\n6. All States enjoy such jurisdiction means that any State could potentially investigate and prosecute crimes committed on board vessels, regardless of where the vessel is registered or where the crime took place. This option seems unlikely because it would create confusion and duplication of efforts among States.\n7. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea is an international court that deals with disputes between States over maritime issues. While it may have some role in resolving conflicts over jurisdiction, it is unlikely to be the State that ordinarily exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels.\n\nAnswer:\n\n(B) The flag State. Since we are concerned with crimes committed on board vessels, it is reasonable to assume that the flag State would have jurisdiction over the occurrence.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The term \"justiciability\" refers to the ability of a legal dispute to be heard and resolved by a court of law. In other words, it refers to the type of legal controversy that is appropriate for judicial resolution.\n\nThe first option, (A), is incorrect, as justiciability does not necessarily refer to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders. While there may be other remedies available to enforce a right, justiciability refers to the court's ability to hear and resolve a dispute.\n\nThe second option, (B), is also incorrect, as justiciability does not refer to the just nature or cause of a particular right. Instead, justiciability refers to whether a legal dispute has elements that are appropriate for judicial resolution.\n\nThe third option, (C), is partially correct, as justiciability does involve the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular right conforms to principles of justice. However, justiciability encompasses a broader range of factors beyond this assessment.\n\nThe fourth option, (D), is incorrect, as justiciability does not refer to the obligation of a state to enforce a particular right. In fact, a court may find that a government has a duty to enforce a particular right, but justiciability applies to the court's ability to hear and resolve legal controversies, not governments' obligations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(E) None of the Above",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "I believe the correct answer is (C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\nR2P is a principle that entails that states have the responsibility to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. It also allows for other states to intervene if the state in question fails to protect its population. The principle was adopted in 2005 by the UN General Assembly after the failure to intervene in the Rwandan genocide.\n\nHumanitarian intervention, on the other hand, is the use of military force by countries to protect populations from human rights abuses, in the absence of consent from the state in question or a UN mandate.\n\nOne of the main differences between the two lies in the requirement for UN Security Council involvement in R2P. As such the focus lies on preventing a humanitarian crisis as opposed to what is essentially arbitrary humanitarian intervention where no guarantee can be given that anymore human suffering will be prevented that caused by the intervention than would be the case without it.",
