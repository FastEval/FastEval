            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, let's review the definition of justiciability. Justiciability refers to the ability of a court to hear and decide a specific legal matter. This means that a case is eligible to be brought before a court and that the court has the authority to provide a remedy.\n\nNow, let's look at the given options:\n\n(A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders: This option is incorrect because it is confusing the concept of justiciability with the enforcement of a right. While enforcement is important, it is not a part of the definition of justiciability.\n(B) Justiciability refers to the just nature or cause of a particular right: This option is also incorrect. Justiciability refers to the court's ability to hear and decide a case, not whether the cause of the case is just or not.\n(C) Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular right conforms to principles of justice: This option is closer to the correct definition of justiciability but still not exact. While courts may consider principles of justice when determining whether a case is justiciable, justiciability itself refers to the court's ability to hear and decide the case.\n(D) Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular Right: This option is also incorrect. Justiciability refers to the court's ability to hear and decide a case, not the obligation of a state to enforce a right.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(E) Justiciability refers to the courts' ability to hear and decide a specific legal matter.",

            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Point (C) is the answer, but let me explain it: \"Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is a humanitarian-based intervention philosophy that a state or international organization should protect its own citizens from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. It is based on the principle of sovereignty as responsibility. In 2001, the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) introduced the document with the same name which basically reshaped the traditional meaning of sovereignty and reaffirmed the idea that nations are entitled to. The UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan endorsed the ICISS\u2019s document, calling on member states, civil society, the United Nations, and regional organizations to react more effectively in protecting people from gross human rights violations.[3] The Security Council adopted resolution 1674 on 28 April 2006, which affirmed the provisions of the ICISS\u2019s document and its support for the concept of the Responsibility to Protect. Two months later, on 11 July 2006, the General Assembly adopted the resolution 60/1. Resolution commended the principles of the ICISS\u2019s report and committed themselves to implementing its recommendations.[4] Resolution 1674 paragraph 5 was of particular importance, as it supported the use of chapter VII measures, including collective intervention, in the case of genocide.[5] Note: This is to say that military intervention is an option in the case of genocide, which is also stated in 60/1. On 20 December 2009, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 63/308, which proclaimed 2010 an International Year to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the entry into force of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.[6]  After the 2005 World Summit, the Secretary-General has played a key role in the development and implementation of R2P. Since then, the General Assembly and the Security Council have supported this new agenda, and every country is accompanied by the principle of R2P.[7] Points about the Responsibility to Protect: It is based on an idea introduced in a report by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty in 2001.[8] The principle has three stages: prevent, react, rebuild.[9] R2P is based on the idea that some sovereign states are not able to ensure the safety of their citizens from civil war, coup d Nadal sitoates, disease or natural disaster, or from economic circumstances. R2P was adopted by the 2005 World Summit and has since been endorsed by numerous regional and national organizations. The United Nations 2005 World Summit Outcome Document stated that sovereignty entails responsibility.[10] Should a state be unwilling or unable to prevent the commission of atrocity crimes occurring within its borders, the international community has the right to intervene. This preference for non-coercive measures reflects the emerging trend incterm supporting \u2018 \u0441\u043evereignty-AS",
