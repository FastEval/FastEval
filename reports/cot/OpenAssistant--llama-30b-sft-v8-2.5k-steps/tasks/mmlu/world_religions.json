            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) Offerings. \n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, we need to use our knowledge of language and religious terminology. \n\nFirst, let's define \"murti.\" A murti is a physical representation or statue of a Hindu god or goddess, often used for worship or meditation. \n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities. \n\nOption (A) Offerings may refer to items or objects that are given to a Hindu deity in a religious ceremony. However, this is not a visual representation of the deity. \n\nOption (B) Prayers could be another potential answer. Hindus often engage in prayer and worship of their gods. But again, this is not a physical object. \n\nOption (C) Apparitions could refer to a supernatural or ghostly appearance of a deity, but this is not a physical object like a murti. \n\nOption (D) Idols could be a possibility, but Hinduism typically prefers murti instead of idols. \n\nBased on these considerations, the best answer is (A) Offerings. \n\nGood job, you found the right answer!
