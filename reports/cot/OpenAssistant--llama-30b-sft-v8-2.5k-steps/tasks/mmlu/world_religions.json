Buddhism was first introduced to Japan in the 6th century through Korean monks and the Chinese monk Ganellen ( Een of Deene in Deen ).\n2. Prince Sh\u014dtoku , who was known for his efforts to promote Buddhism in Japan, followed the Chinese Buddhist teachings of the Three Treatises once he had returned from China in 574 CE.\n3. As a result of Sh\u014dtoku's efforts, the Shingonenson temple, also known as Ichij\u014d-ji (\u4e00\u4e57\u5bfa), is the first Buddhist temple constructed in Japan and was erected in 596 CE at Kawasaki-ku in Kobe with the assistance of another Korean monk , Chien- enfants or Ching-wan (\ufffd difficile \u00e0 prononcer Chingan ).\n4. It\u2019s worth mentioning that while the Shingon edition of Buddhism could trace back its legacy to Hui-neng , the Six Nara sects had established Buddhism in Japan by the late 6th century .\n5. Two of these temples, the Yakushi-ji (\u85ac\u6307\u5bfa), devoted to Maitreya Buddha , and the T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji (\u6771\u7167\u5927\u5bfa), also devoted to Maitreya Buddha, under the protection of the Fujiwara clan , could trace their lineage to Buddhism in Korea.\nThe three temples, the K\u014dfuku-ji (\u1f79\u03bf \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043eint damnatum or proteg\u00e9 , but he had assisted  \u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438 the Main Temple or Konponch\u016bd\u014d.\n6.
