The exact mechanism for triggering a type-Ia supernova is still not completely understood, but it is thought to involve a white dwarf star accreting mass from a companion star until it reaches the limit and undergoes a catastrophic explosion.

            "question": "Why is the sky blue?\n\n(A) Because the molecules that compose the Earth's atmosphere have a blue-ish color.\n(B) Because the sky reflects the color of the Earth's oceans.\n(C) Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.\n(D) Because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially absorbs all other colors.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by the Earth's atmosphere. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it is composed of many different colors of light, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. These colors are all part of the visible light spectrum. The atmosphere is made up of a mixture of gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, and small amounts of other gases. The molecules in the atmosphere behave like tiny little mirrors, and when the sun's light enters the atmosphere, these molecules scatter the different colors of light in all directions.\n\nIndigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red light are scattered in all directions by the atmosphere, but they are scattered more by the atmosphere than other colors. This is because blue light has a shorter wavelength and is more easily scattered by the molecules in the atmosphere. This scattering makes the sky appear bright blue during the daytime. The blueness of the sky is also dependent on the angle at which sunlight enters the atmosphere and the position of the observer. When looking directly at the sun, the blueness of the sky is less pronounced. The blueness of the sky also varies depending on your location on the Earth's surface, and the time of year. In the polar regions, the sky may appear almost white due to the way sunlight is scattered by the atmosphere.\n\nScattering also affects the appearance of the night sky. The scattering of moonlight by the atmosphere makes it appear bluish. The color of the night sky depends on the position of the moon, the atmospheric conditions, and your location on the Earth's surface.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) After you\u2019ve repeated your experiment many times.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The scientific method is an iterative process that involves forming a hypothesis, designing and conducting experiments to test the hypothesis, analyzing the results, and making conclusions based on the data.\n2. Proving a theory requires repeatability and consistency of experimental results, as well as corroboration by other scientists.\n3. The first time you drop a bowling ball and it falls to the ground, it does not necessarily prove your hypothesis. It may be due to other factors such as gravity or air resistance. Repeating the experiment multiple times and observing consistent results is necessary to build a stronger case for your theory.\n4. Similar to the above, the attraction between objects could be due to other factors such as air resistance or buoyancy. Repeating the experiment multiple times and observing consistent results is necessary to build a stronger case for your theory.\n5. While it's rare to be able to completely prove a theory 100%, theories can be supported by ample evidence from repeatable experiments that show the theory's predictions are consistently accurate and that it is the best explanation for the observed phenomena.\n6. Repeatability and consistency of experimental results, as well as corroboration by other scientists, are necessary for proving a theory.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is the correct answer.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what we're trying to find - the expression for the total energy released in the impact of a comet of mass m on the Earth (mass M, radius R). Let's break down the question further:\n\n1. What is the minimum impact speed of a comet of mass m impacting the Earth (mass M, radius R)?\n\n2. What is the expression for the total energy released in the impact?\n\nNow, let's approach the question step-by-step:\n\n1. To determine the minimum impact speed of the comet, we need to know the formula for Kinetic Energy. The formula for Kinetic Energy is 0.5*m*v^2, where m is the mass of the comet and v is its speed. In this case, we want to find the minimum impact speed, so we assume that the comet is traveling at a constant velocity and not accelerating. Therefore, we can set Kinetic Energy to 0 and solve for the velocity:\n\n* 0.5*m*v^2 = 0\n* v^2 = 0\n* v = 0\n\nThe minimum impact speed of the comet would be zero.\n\n2. Next, we need to determine the expression for the total energy released in the impact. The formula for the total energy released in an impact is given by the expression:\n\n* E = m*g*h\n\nWhere E is the total energy released, m is the mass of the comet, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the impact.\n\nIn this case, we can assume the surface of the Earth is a fixed distance from the center of the Earth. Therefore, the height of the impact would be the difference between the comet's altitude and the Earth's radius. Let's set up the equation:\n\n* E = m*g*h\n* E = m*g*(R - r)\n* E = m*g*(R - (0))\n* E = m*g*R\n\nTherefore, the expression for the total energy released in the impact is E = m*g*R.\n\nIn summary, the minimum impact speed of the comet is zero, and the expression for the total energy released in the impact is E = m*g*R.

By determining the abundance of certain radioactive isotopes in a sample and comparing them to the expected abundance based on the decay rate of those isotopes, the age of the sample can be estimated. This technique is widely used in geology and other fields to determine the age of rocks and other materials.\n\nBy radioactive dating of lunar samples it can be shown that they are older than the Earth's surface, because the Moon's surface is\u099c\u09ac\u09be\u09a4 older than Earth's surface as determined by radiometric dating.",
