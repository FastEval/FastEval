Jus ad bello (right to wage war)\n2. Jus in bello (right way to conduct war)\n\nThe principle of military necessity belongs to the second category, jus in bello, which deals with the so-called \"right conduct within war,\" specifically with the norms that regulate how wars are to be fought.

This does not match the statement, as the issue is not solely about quantity.\n\nOption (B) indicates that the value is determined by the quality alone, or the type of pleasure. This also does not match the statement, as it is not clear from the given information what Mill believed about the importance of pleasure quality.\n\nOption (C) suggests that the value depends on both the quantity and the quality. This seems like a reasonable interpretation based on the statement, as Mill might have argued that the value of a pleasure involves both how much and what type of pleasure is experienced.\n\nOption (D) implies that neither quantity nor quality determines the value, which is opposite to the given statement, as it appears that Mill did believe that the value of a pleasure depends on its quantity and/or quality.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given information, option (C) is the best answer.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Nathanson supports (B) proportional retributivism.\n\nReasoning:\nRetributivism is the moral theory of punishment that holds that the inherent deserving of punishment justifies the imposition of a punishment, even if it does not have a compensatory or deterrent function. The theory can be further categorized into different types based on the justification for determining the severity of the punishment.\n\nPreventive retributivism justifies punishment based on its potential to prevent future harm. Proportional retributivism justifies punishment based on the extent to which it matches the severity of the crime committed. Equality retributivism justifies punishment based on the principle of treating similar crimes with similar punishments. Retaliatory retributivism justifies punishment based on retaliation and vengeance.\n\nNathanson supports proportional retributivism, which holds that punishment should be proportional to the seriousness of the crime committed. This is based on the principle of fairness, where individuals who commit more severe crimes should receive harsher punishments than individuals who commit less severe crimes. This principle ensures that the punishment fits the crime and is seen as just by the community.",

Therefore, it is useful to understand it in order to answer the question.\n2: From Gardiner's analysis, the climate change problem is characterized by four key features:\n\t* Agency: There are many different parties involved in the problem, including governments, corporations, advocacy groups, and individuals. Each of these parties has its own interests and agenda in addressing or resolving the problem.\n\t* Complexity: The climate change problem is highly complex. It involves multiple causal factors, including economic, social, political, and technological factors. The impacts of climate change are also multifaceted, affecting different regions and communities in different ways.\n\t* Urgency: The climate change problem requires urgent action. The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world, and the pace of change is accelerating.\n\t* Extension: The climate change problem extends over time and across space. It is a long-term problem that will require sustained effort over many decades. It is also a global problem that requires coordinated action by countries around the world.\n3: Based on the four features of the climate change problem described above, we can now see that the following options are characteristic of the climate change problem:\n\t* Agency: The dispersion of causes and effects is a characteristic of the climate change problem. Different parties have different interests and agendas in addressing the problem.\n\t* Complexity: The fragmentation of agency and the dispersion of causes and effects are characteristics of the climate change problem. The problem involves multiple causal factors, including economic, social, political, and technological factors. The impacts of climate change are also multifaceted, affecting different regions and communities in different ways.\n\t* Urgency: The urgency of the climate change problem is a characteristic of the problem.
