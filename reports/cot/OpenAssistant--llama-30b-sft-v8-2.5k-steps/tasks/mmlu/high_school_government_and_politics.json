            "model_answer": "The establishment clause and the free-exercise clause are two provisions in the First Amendment of the United States Constitution that deal with the relationship between the government and religion. The establishment clause basically prohibits the government from establishing an official religion or showing preference for one religion over others, whereas the free-exercise clause ensures that individuals have the right to freely practice their religion without government interference. The question is asking about the balance between these two clauses, and which of the following statements best describes the Supreme Court's approach to this balance.\n\nOption (A) is not related to the balance between the establishment and free-exercise clauses. It is true that the freedom of speech is protected by the First Amendment, but it does not directly relate to the question about the balance between the establishment and free-exercise clauses.\n\nOption (B) is also not relevant to the question. The recognition of a church by the federal government and its tax-exempt status may be relevant to the relationship between church and state, but it is not specifically tied to the balance between the establishment and free-exercise clauses.\n\nOption (C) is not relevant to the question either. While the creation and dissolution of administrative agencies may be related to the separation of powers and the role of the government in society, it does not directly relate to the balance between the establishment and free-exercise clauses.\n\nOption (D) is the best answer to the question. The statement describes a balance between the establishment clause and the free-exercise clause where the government does not endorse or prohibit religion, but allows individuals to freely practice their religion, as long as it is done voluntarily and without government sponsorship. This describes the approach that the Supreme Court has taken in many cases, where the government is not allowed to interfere with an individual's right to practice their religion, but at the same time, the government cannot show preference for one religion over another or establish an official religion.",

Federal judges are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate to serve as neutral and impartial arbiters of civil and criminal legal disputes.

Federal judges can be subject to disciplinary action if they violate the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, which is codified in the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980. The Code of Conduct includes provisions for disciplining federal judges for violating the law, conducting themselves in a manner that undermines public confidence in the judiciary, or conducting themselves in a manner that could create the appearance of impropriety.\n3.

Sims (1964), which ruled that the principle applies to congressional and state legislative districts, respectively.\n\n(B) The principle of \"separate but equal\" was established by the Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). Marbury v. Madison did not establish this principle.\n\n(C) Judicial review was established as a principle in Marbury v. Madison, which held that the Supreme Court has the power to determine the constitutionality of laws and actions of the executive branch. In the case, the Supreme Court held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear Marbury's case, thus establishing the principle of judicial review. This principle allows the judicial branch to act as a check on the power of the executive and legislative branches.\n\n(D) The principle of \"right to privacy\" was not established in Marbury v. Madison. It was established in later Supreme Court decisions, such as Roe v. Wade (1973), which established the right to privacy in certain contexts, including the right to choose to have an abortion.\n\nThe principle established by the Supreme Court's decision in Marbury v.
