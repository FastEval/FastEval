            "question": "A police officer carries out hundreds of traffic stops every year. When his supervisor is reviewing the officer\u2019s records for the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of various genders, ages, and races. However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child. What psychological framework would directly address the unconscious bias in his behavior? \n\n(A) Behaviorist\n(B) Psychoanalytic\n(C) Cognitive behavioral\n(D) Humanistic",

            "model_answer": "The framework that would directly address the unconscious bias in the officer's behavior is (B) Psychoanalytic.\n\nThe officer's behavior is influenced by his past experiences, specifically his abusive relationship with his father. Psychoanalytic theory would focus on exploring the unconscious mind and how past experiences shape current behavior. By understanding the root of the officer's bias, it could potentially be addressed and changed.",

The options include R Bannister, S Coe, J DiMaggio, and WG George.\n3. We can eliminate J DiMaggio as a baseball player who is not known for track and field.\n4. We can also eliminate WG George as a cricketer who is not known for running.\n5. We are left with R Bannister and S Coe, who are both runners.\n6. While S Coe won many prestigious races over his career, R Bannister is the one who set the world record for the mile race in 1954 with a time of 3 minutes and 59 seconds.\n7.

We can use the following formula:\n\nAcceleration (a) = 2 * velocity (v) / distance (d)\n\nIn this case, the distance (d) is given as 50m, and the velocity (v) can be found using the following kinematic equation:\n\nFinal velocity (V) = Initial velocity (Vi) + Acceleration (a) * time (t)\n\nWe can't directly substitute the given final velocity and distance into the equation without knowing the time it takes for the car to reach the velocity. Instead, we can rearrange the equation to solve for acceleration (a) using the velocity (V) and distance (d):\n\nAcceleration (a) = 2 * Final velocity (V) / Distance (d)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\nAcceleration (a) = 2 * 40.2 m/s / 50m\n\na = 4.02 m/s^2\n\nTherefore, the acceleration required to reach a velocity of 130 km/h is (A) 13 m/s^2.",

            "question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, which of the following statements is the author likely to agree with?\n\n(A) Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use.\n(B) Patients on a diet would benefit from sauna use.\n(C) Salt restriction would be equal to sauna use for hypertensive patients.\n(D) Patients with skin conditions may be cured with sauna use.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) Irreversible inhibition.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Competitive inhibition occurs when a compound competes with the substrate for the active site of an enzyme, reducing the enzyme's activity. In the case of DFP and ACE, DFP directly binds to the active site and inactivates the enzyme, so this is not competitive inhibition.\n* Noncompetitive inhibition occurs when a compound binds to a site on the enzyme that is distinct from the active site, and the enzyme's activity is reduced. In the case of DFP and ACE, DFP binds directly to the active site, so this is not noncompetitive inhibition.\n* Irreversible inhibition occurs when a compound binds to the enzyme's active site and forms a covalent bond, blocking the active site and inactivating the enzyme. This is the case for DFP and ACE, since DFP permanently inactivates the enzyme by binding to the active site.\n* Partially competitive inhibition occurs when a compound partly blocks the enzyme's active site, and the enzyme's activity is reduced. However, in the case of DFP and ACE, DFP completely inactivates the enzyme by binding to the active site, so this is not partially competitive inhibition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Irreversible inhibition.",
