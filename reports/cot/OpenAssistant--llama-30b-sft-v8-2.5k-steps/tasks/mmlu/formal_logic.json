The first sentence, (A), is a premise that supports the conclusion by stating that it is hard to observe the same weakened intelligence due to emotions in our peers as we do in our everyday patients.\n3. The second sentence, (B), is another premise that supports the conclusion by stating that the arrogance of our consciousness, which belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.\n4. The third sentence, (C), is a premise that further supports the conclusion by stating that because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is (D) It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.",

The second premise states that either (1) K and L are both true, or (2) K is true and L is false. \n\nIn order to determine whether this argument is valid or invalid, we need to construct a truth table. A truth table is a table that lists all possible truth assignments for the propositional variables in an argument and determines whether the argument is valid in each case.\n\nHere's the truth table for the given argument:\n\n| K | L | ~K | (K \u00b7 L) | (K \u00b7 ~L) | ~K \u2261 L |\n|---|---|-----|---------|---------|---------|\n| T | T | F  | T       | F       | T       |\n| T | F | F  | F       | T       | T       |\n| F | T | F  | F       | F       | T       |\n| F | F | F  | T       | F       | T       |\n\nLooking at the truth table, we can see that the argument is not valid.

However, in the second row of the table we see that if K is true and L is false, neither premise of the argument holds true. In this case, ~K is false and (K \u00b7 L) is false, while (K \u00b7 ~L) is true. This is an example of a counterexample for the argument, and thus the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: (B).",
