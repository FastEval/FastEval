Identify the first premise: \"It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients.\"\n2.

Identify the conclusion: \"Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\"\n\nThe argument is presented in a balanced and logical structure. Each premise builds on the previous one to support the conclusion.\n\nNow, let's output the answer: (D) It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.",

Since David teaches Chris, we can use the predicate \"T\" (teaches) with David as the subject (d) and Chris as the object (c).\n\nThe final line of our answer should therefore be:\n\nAssuming we have the relationship between David and Chris in the form of dTc, we could further simplify this to just dC when sorted in alphabetical order; since an individual cannot teach themselves, the object of the relationship is sorted after the subject in reverse alphabetical order. So the first choice, Tdc, is sorted in alphabetical order; the second choice, Tcd, is sorted alphabetically with the sorted subject (\"d\" for David) first; the third choice, Tcc, would be sorted in alphabetical order; and the fourth choice, dTc, would be sorted with sorted subject (\"d\" for David) first. So only Tdc and Tcd fulfill all these conditions, and we can eliminate choices C) Tcc and D) dTc. \n\nIn summary, the best prediction for a single relationship is B) Tcd",
