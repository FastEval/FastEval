            "question": "Suppose that an expansionary fiscal policy leads to a large increase in real output and a small increase in the price level. From this it can be inferred that\n\n(A) inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus.\n(B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n(C) aggregate supply decreased.\n(D) aggregate demand is steeply sloped.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Answer: (B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. Expansionary fiscal policy involves an increase in government spending or a decrease in taxes, which increases aggregate demand.\n2. An increase in aggregate demand can lead to an increase in real output only if there are unemployed resources in the economy.\n3. If the economy was already at full employment before the fiscal stimulus, the increase in aggregate demand would lead to inflation instead of an increase in real output.\n4. Therefore, it can be concluded that the economy initially had some unemployed resources, which were able to be employed without causing inflation.\n5. Aggregate supply remains unchanged since it refers to the total amount of goods and services produced by the economy at a given price level.\n6. Aggregate demand is steeply sloped if an increase in the price level leads to a significant decrease in real output. However, the scenario described in the question involves a small increase in the price level and a large increase in real output, which would imply that aggregate demand is not steeply sloped.\n7. Inflation impacting the economy before the fiscal stimulus would also result in an increase in the price level, which is not consistent with the scenario described in the question.",

Goods and services produced outside the United States, regardless of the citizenship of the producers, are not included in U.S. GDP.\n\nI. The market value of movies made in Africa by U.S. citizens is not included in U.S. GDP because they are produced outside the United States.\n\nII. The market value of olive oil made in Italy and sold in the United States is not included in U.S. GDP because it is produced outside the United States, even though it is sold within the United States.\n\nIII. The market value of blue jeans made in the United States and sold in Japan is included in U.S. GDP because the goods are produced within the United States, even though they are sold outside the United States.\n\nIV.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve shows the relationship between the price level and the level of real GDP. The aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the relationship between the price level and the level of real GDP. If both SRAS and AD increase, it means that there is an increase in the number of goods and services being produced and an increase in the demand for those goods and services.\n\nLet me label the equations for SRAS and AD as:\n\n SRAS: Y = a - bP\n AD : Y = c + dP\n\nThe equilibrium point is where the two curves intersect. The equilibrium point can be found by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\n a - bP = c + dP\n\nSolving for P:\n\n -P = (c - a)/(b - d)\n P = (a - c)/(b - d)\n\nWe can see that because both SRAS and AD increase, the price level rises and real GDP also rises.

            "model_answer": "Answer: (B) sometimes raise and sometimes lower the amount of the product sold domestically.\n\nReasoning:\n\n* Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, making them more expensive for consumers.\n* Quotas are limits on the quantity of a good that can be imported, also affecting supply and demand for the good.\n* Each of these policies could potentially increase or decrease domestic prices and consumption of a good.\n* (B) \"sometimes raise and sometimes lower the amount of the product sold domestically\" is the most accurate choice, as it acknowledges that the effect of these policies is not always predictable or straightforward.\n\nHowever, one can conclude that:\n\n* Lower prices in the long run may lead to lower domestic prices. Assume tariffs and quotas prevent competition, then the local producer may raise prices without the fear of losing market share to imports. Eventually, other producers may enter the market, leading to lower prices.\n* In the short run, tariffs and quotas may either increase or decrease domestic prices and consumption of a good.",

When the demand for Treasury bonds decreases, their price will decrease as well, other things equal.\n3. To answer this question we should consider what could cause the demand for Treasury bonds to decrease.\n4. One factor that could decrease the demand for Treasury bonds is an increase in interest rates.\n5. If interest rates increase, investors may decide to invest in other assets, such as stocks or corporate bonds, that offer higher returns than Treasury bonds.\n6. This would decrease the demand for Treasury bonds, causing their price to fall.\n7. So, a likely cause of falling Treasury bond prices could be expansionary monetary policy which increases interest rates.\n\nAnswer: A)",

It does not directly align with the concept of a foregone best alternative.\n- \"Switching cost\" refers to the cost of changing from one provider or product to another. It is similar to the concept of opportunity cost in that it involves giving up something in order to gain something else, but it is not the same as the best alternative that is unavailable due to the decision made.\n- \"Inferior cost\" refers to the cost of choosing the worst or least desirable alternative. This choice is also eliminated because it does not match the description of the best alternative that is given up.\n- \"Opportunity cost\" is the cost of the best alternative that cannot be chosen because of a decision that has been made.

It is determined by economic factors such as the rate of job creation/destruction, the mobility of workers, and the efficiency of labor markets.\n\n(A) is incorrect because there can still be cyclical unemployment even when a nation is operating at the natural rate of unemployment.\n(B) is incorrect because the natural rate of unemployment does not necessarily correspond to an inflation rate of zero.\n(C) is incorrect because structural unemployment occurs when there is a mismatch between the skills of workers and the jobs available, regardless of the natural rate of unemployment.\n(D) is incorrect because the natural rate of unemployment is not necessarily associated with a recession.\n\nThe correct answer is (E) None of the above.",
