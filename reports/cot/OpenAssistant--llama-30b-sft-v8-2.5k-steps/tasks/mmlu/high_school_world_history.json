            "model_answer": "The passage is most associated with the formation of the non-aligned movement. This can be determined by analyzing the content of the passage. The Indonesian leader Sukarno spoke about the need to preserve peace and inject the voice of reason into world affairs. He also spoke about mobilizing the strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. These ideas are in line with the principles of the non-aligned movement. The non-aligned movement was a political movement that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, with the aim of promoting peace and cooperation among countries that were not aligned with any major power bloc. The movement was particularly popular among developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The passage cited is excerpted from Sukarno's keynote address at the Bandung Conference, which was a gathering of Asian and African leaders in 1955. The conference served as a key moment in the development of the non-aligned movement. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.",

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

The passage explains how the development and improvement of gunpowder weapons in Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s proved useful in the protracted sieges of that period, making governments willing to invest in their development. In contrast, China faced more mobile threats after the mid-1300s and focused on improving horse archer units to combat these threats. This difference in focus on the development of gunpowder weapons contributed to Europe's military superiority over China.\n\nHowever, the passage does not explain why European states attained military superiority over all non-Western powers, as stated in choice (B). The argument is specific to the comparison between Europe and China. Choice (A) is also incorrect because the passage does not address the sharing of technologies between societies.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The question refers to an excerpt from an address by Indonesian leader Sukarno at the Bandung Conference in 1955. It asks what task was considered more urgent than that of preserving peace by Sukarno and other leaders in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The answer is not immediately apparent and requires an understanding of the historical context.\n\nFirstly, the address was given at the Bandung Conference in 1955, which was a meeting of Asian and African leaders to promote cooperation and economic development in their respective regions. The conference was a response to the longstanding dominance of Western colonial powers in Asia and Africa, and the struggle for independence and self-determination that was taking place in these regions at the time.\n\nSecondly, the question mentions that Sukarno and other leaders in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East attempted to maintain a neutral stance during various conflicts throughout the 20th century. It asks which of four conflicts the leaders did not completely succeed in maintaining a neutral stance during. It is reasonable to assume that the answer lies within the four conflicts provided in the answer choices.\n\nThirdly, the answer lies within the historical context of the four conflicts mentioned in the question. The Arab-Israeli conflict refers to the ongoing conflict between Arab countries and Israel since the end of the British Mandate of Palestine in 1948. The Korean War was a military conflict between North and South Korea that took place between 1950 and 1953. The Cold War was a period of political and military tension between Western countries, led by the United States, and Eastern countries, led by the Soviet Union, that lasted from 1947 to 1991. The Vietnam conflicts were a series of military conflicts that took place in Vietnam between 1945 and 1975.\n\nFourthly, the answer lies within the actions and decisions of Sukarno and other leaders during each of the four conflicts. Sukarno, who was President of Indonesia at the time of the Bandung Conference, played a significant role in maintaining a neutral stance during the Cold War and the Vietnam conflicts by upholding a non-aligned principle, which sought to maintain Indonesia's independence from both Western and Eastern powers and promote cooperation among developing countries. However, he did not uphold this principle throughout all conflicts, specifically during the Indonesian massacre of 1965 that took place after he was overthrown from power. Therefore, the answer is not (A) the Arab-Israeli conflict, (B) the Korean War, (C) the Cold War, or (D) the Vietnam conflicts.\n\nFifthly, the answer is (D) the Vietnam conflicts. Sukarno and other leaders in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East attempted to maintain a neutral stance during the Cold War and the Vietnam conflicts but did not completely succeed in maintaining that stance during the Vietnam conflicts. The Vietnam conflicts had a significant impact on the region, and the non-aligned principle promoted by Sukarno and other leaders was an attempt to navigate the complex geopolitical landscape of the time and promote cooperation among developing countries. The answer is (D) the Vietnam conflicts.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Answer: (D) Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The text describes the actions of Colonel Bonesteel in the 1940s to establish a surrender zone in Korea as far north as possible to prevent Soviet advancement into the country.\n2. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, which was 600 miles away, meaning there was a lack of immediate American support for the region.\n3. Bonesteel used the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line to divide the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n4. The use of the 38th parallel as a dividing line led to the division of Korea into two separate nations, with the United States administering the southern part of the country and the Soviet Union administering the area north of the parallel.\n5. This division of Korea has remained in place since the end of World War II, with the two nations maintaining separate governments, economies, and cultures, while remaining in close proximity to one another.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.",

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence.
