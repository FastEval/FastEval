            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The argument in this passage provides an explanation for why Europe developed gunpowder weapons while China focused on other forms of warfare. It describes how the use of early cannons in Europe was useful during sieges, which were common in the wars of the time, and how this led governments to invest in improving gunpowder weapons. In contrast, China faced threats from mobile steppe nomads and therefore prioritized the development of horse archer units to combat them. \n\nBased on the passage, the question most closely related to this is (B): Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era. The development and improvement of gunpowder weapons in Europe during the 1200s-1400s laid the foundation for European military superiority in the modern era. This was a key factor in European colonization and expansion in the 17th-20th centuries. \n\nAnswer: \n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nThe city of Ghana consists of two towns. One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(C) The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.\n\nThere is no direct evidence in the passage that Ghanians were engaged in trade with Asia, but there are some indirect indications. The fact that the king adorned himself with gold and jewels is suggestive of trade with a region where such luxury items were abundant. India was known for its production of gold and jewelry at the time, and it is likely that the king's wealth was derived from trade with India or other Asian countries. This is supported by the mention of ivory, leopard skins, and other goods in the passage that could have been traded with Africa in exchange for gold. While there is no mention of direct trade with Asia, the passage gives the impression that the kingdom was not isolated and was likely engaged in trade with other regions.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The events depicted here involve the decision by Colonel Bonesteel to establish a surrender zone for Japanese forces in Korea during the 1940s. This decision was motivated by the desire to establish a line of division between American and Russian zones of influence in Korea, and to prevent Russian troops from seizing all of Korea. The 38th parallel was used as the hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces would surrender.\n\nThe decision by Colonel Bonesteel had significant implications for Koreans because it effectively divided Korea into two zones of influence along the 38th parallel. This division of Korea became a permanent feature of the country's political geography following the end of World War II and the establishment of separate, politically-independent governments in the north and south. The ongoing tensions and conflicts between North and South Korea, including the Korean War in the 1950s, can be traced back in part to this decision by Colonel Bonesteel to divide Korea into American and Russian zones of influence.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (D) Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(E) Pessimistic, uninspired\n\nThe question is asking about the differing views of Charles Dickens and William Wordsworth on the French Revolution. The information provided quotes two passages from their works, one from \"A Tale of Two Cities\" by Charles Dickens, and one from \"The Prelude\" by William Wordsworth.\n\nOne possible way to approach this question is to examine the tone and content of each passage. The passage from \"A Tale of Two Cities\" is a list of contrasting pairs that suggests a sense of chaos and uncertainty. The phrase \"it was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,\" etc. creates a sense of contradiction and instability. The use of the word \"epoch,\" which means \"a period of time in history,\" emphasizes the idea that this was a unique and unpredictable time. The final sentence in the passage then suggests that the period was \"so far like the present period\" that the authorities had extreme reactions to it. This suggests that the French Revolution was seen as a chaotic and unstable event that created extremes of emotion and opinion.\n\nIn contrast, the passage from \"The Prelude\" by William Wordsworth depicts the dawn of the French Revolution as a time of idealism and hope. The phrase \"bliss was it in that dawn to be alive\" suggests a sense of joy and excitement, and the phrase \"but to be young was very heaven\" emphasizes the idea that youth and idealism were central to the Revolution. This suggests that Wordsworth had a more optimistic view of the Revolution, and saw it as an opportunity for renewal and growth.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate adjectives to describe Dickens's and Wordsworth's views of the French Revolution would be \"optimistic/uninspired\" and \"understanding/encouraged,\" respectively. Dickens's view is more pessimistic and emphasizes the chaotic and unpredictable nature of the Revolution, while Wordsworth's view is more optimistic and emphasizes the sense of idealism and hope that accompanied the dawn of the Revolution.",

It is also impossible to say that he who undertakes to carry out these revisions for himself transgresses a law, since the Versailles \"Diktat\" is not law to us. A signature was forced out of us with pistols at our head and with the threat of hunger for millions of people. And then this document, with our signature, obtained by force, was proclaimed as a solemn law.\"\nAdolf Hitler, speech to the Reichstag, September 1, 1939\nSource 2:\n\"We shall not flag or fail.

            "model_answer": "In order to answer this question we must understand the historical context of the Treaty of Versailles, which is the source of Hitler's condemnation. After World War I, the Allied Powers (United Kingdom, France, and Italy) and the United States met in Paris to negotiate a peace treaty with Germany. The main aim of the treaty was to punish Germany and prevent further aggression by limiting its military power and territorial expansion. The treaty was signed on June 28, 1919, and came into effect on January 10, 1920. It imposed a series of harsh conditions on Germany, including territorial changes, reparations, and disarmament. These conditions were considered very unfair by many Germans, who thought that their country had been treated too harshly and that the treaty would lead to political and economic instability.\n\n(C) A widespread belief in Germany that it had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I is the correct answer.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race \u2014 by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\n\nHowever, the Cawnpore Massacre was not just a military uprising, it was also fuelled by religious, racial, and cultural tensions. The British journalist William Howard Russell notes that the mutiny and revolt were led by subject races who sought to \"shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions\". The Indian historian Rudrangshu Mukherjee highlights that the revolt was a response to the violence and hierarchy imposed by the British, who treated Indians as inferior and \"animals\". Therefore, while the Cawnpore Massacre was a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy, it was also a response to the British colonial oppression and racism.",
