            "model_answer": "Nearsightedness results from a defect in the eye that causes the light to focus incorrectly on the retina. This defect can either be too much or too little curvature of the cornea and lens. Let's take a closer look at the options given:\n\n(A) Too much curvature of the cornea and lens would cause the light to spread out and not focus properly on the retina, this would result in farsightedness.\n(B) Too little curvature of the cornea and lens would mean that the light would be before it reaches the retina, this would also result in farsightedness.\n(C) Too much curvature of the iris and lens would not affect the focus of light.\n(D) Too little curvature of the iris and lens would not affect the focus of light.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Too little curvature of the iris and lens.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) Hierarchy of needs.\n\nReasoning:\n\nAbraham Maslow proposed the idea that some motives are more imperative to survival than others. This suggests that there is a hierarchy or ranking of needs, with some being more important than others.\n\nThe first approach, homeostatic regulation, is the process by which organisms maintain a stable internal environment despite external changes. It does not directly address the relative importance of different motives.\n\nThe second approach, goal-setting, is the process of setting and working towards specific objectives. While this approach may take into account the relative importance of different motives in achieving goals, it does not necessarily reflect their innate importance to survival.\n\nThe third approach, expectancy-value, is the mental process by which individuals evaluate the potential outcomes of their actions and make decisions based on the expected value of each option. This approach does not directly address the relative importance of different motives either.\n\nThe final approach, hierarchy of needs, is the concept that Maslow proposed to describe the relative importance of different motivational needs. This approach suggests that some needs, such as physiological and safety needs, are more fundamental and must be met before higher-level needs, such as the need for love and self-actualization, can be satisfied. Therefore, (D) Hierarchy of needs is the correct approach that expresses Maslow's idea.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The heritability of a trait refers to the proportion of variation in a trait that is due to genetic factors. It is a measure of how much of the variation in a trait is determined by an individual's genes, as opposed to environmental or other factors. The heritability of a cloned population, therefore, would be 100%, as all members of the population are genetically identical and any variation in the trait would be solely due to environmental factors.\n\nExample: If a cloned population of apple trees was grown in different environments, the height of the trees would be determined by the environment (e.g. amount of sunlight, water, nutrients, etc.) and not by their genetic makeup, as all trees are genetically identical. Thus, the heritability of height in this cloned population would be 0%, as none of the variation in height is due to genetic factors.\n\nAnswer: (E) 100%\n\nNote: While this question is based on an \"intuitive\" understanding of the term heritability, it's important to note that the question itself is flawed, as heritability cannot be 100% in a cloned population. The correct answer should be (D) 75%, which is the maximum possible heritability for any trait.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(B) mean provides the most information about how spread out a distribution of scores is.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Variance: Variance is the average of the square of the deviations from the mean. It tells us how much the scores are deviating from the mean. However, it does not provide any information about how spread out the distribution is.\n2. Range: Range is the difference between the highest and lowest scores. It tells us how much the scores vary, but it does not give any information about the shape of the distribution.\n3. Median: Median is the middle score when the scores are arranged in ascending or descending order. It tells us where the scores are clustered, but it does not give any information about the shape of the distribution.\n4. Mean: Mean is the average of all the scores. It provides the most information about the center of the distribution and how spread out the scores are. If the mean is close to the minimum score, then the distribution is clustered around the lower end of the range. If the mean is close to the maximum score, then the distribution is clustered around the upper end of the range. If the mean is in the middle of the range, then the distribution is balanced.\n\nAnswer: (B) mean.",

The theory consists of eight stages, each of which represents a crisis that must be resolved in order to reach the next stage. Each stage has a certain age range and is associated with a specific psychosocial crisis.
