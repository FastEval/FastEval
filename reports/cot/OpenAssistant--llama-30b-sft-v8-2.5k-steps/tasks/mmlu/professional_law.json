            "question": "One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\n(B) admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\n(C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n(D) inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",

            "model_answer": "The issue at hand is whether a consulting attorney's testimony regarding a boy's physical condition during an attorney-client consultation is admissible in a negligence suit brought against a pilot by the boy's father. Four options are given, each with a different reasoning.\n\n(A) This option states that the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit. The attorney-client privilege is a legal privilege that allows clients to keep communications with their attorneys confidential. However, it can be waived by the client's own actions. In this case, since the boy's father is suing the pilot, it can be argued that the attorney-client privilege has been waived, and that the consulting attorney's testimony is admissible.\n\n(B) This option states that there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation. The presence of the boy during the consultation could potentially lead to an argument that the attorney-client privilege does not apply, and that the consulting attorney's testimony is admissible.\n\n(C) This option states that the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications. The attorney-client privilege is meant to protect communications between attorneys and their clients, and to prevent confidential information from being shared. In this case, since the consulting attorney was present during the attorney-client consultation, and the boy's father did not retain the attorney, the attorney-client privilege would likely apply, and that the consulting attorney's testimony would be inadmissible.\n\n(D) This option states that the consulting attorney's testimony was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment. The consulting attorney's testimony regarding the boy's physical condition during the consultation would likely be allowed if the testimony was necessary for medical treatment. However, as the testimony is not needed for medical treatment, the attorney-client privilege would apply, and the testimony would be inadmissible.\n\nTherefore, option (C) is the most reasonable answer, and the consulting attorney's testimony is inadmissible.",

            "question": "A state statute provides: \"Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. \" Violation of the statute is made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found\n\n(A) not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(B) not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(C) guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n(D) guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "In this scenario, there are two different interpretations of what happened during the arrest, so we need to look at the law to determine what it says about the use of force in resisting arrest. In this state, the statute says that it is the duty of a person being arrested to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. Based on this, we can see that the answer cannot be (A) or (D) since these responses refer to the lawfulness of the arrest, which is not what the statute is addressing. Instead, we must look at the actions of the suspect during the arrest to determine whether they are guilty of assault under this statute.\n\nSince the suspect claims to have cursed at the police officer, and the police officer claims that the suspect hit him with a fist, it can be assumed that the suspect did use force in resisting arrest. However, it is important to consider whether this use of force was justified under the statute, which requires that a person being arrested refrain from using force or any weapon. Since the suspect claims to have only cursed at the police officer, it is likely that this did not constitute the use of force. However, the police officer claims that the suspect hit him with a fist, which would constitute force under the statute. Therefore, we can assume that the suspect is guilty of assault.\n\nSo (C) is the most likely answer since the statute is requiring the suspect to refrain from using force and the suspect used force in resisting the arrest.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n- Not (A) because it is not relevant whether the arrest was lawful or not in this case (dependent on the account, the arrest might have been lawful in fact).\n- Not (D) because it is not relevant whether the arrest was lawful or not in this case (dependent on the account, the arrest might have been lawful in fact).\n- Not (B) since the law doesn't provide any exception relating to whether the arrest was lawful or not.\n- (C) The suspect is guilty of assault regardless which account the jury believes because the suspect did not refrain from using force (based on what the police officer said).",

During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testify about statements that the taxpayer made to him. The accountant's proposed testimony is\n\n(A) inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n\nExplanation: The attorney-client privilege is a legal privilege that prevents an attorney from disclosing confidential communications between the attorney and the client. In this case, the accountant is an old family friend of the taxpayer and not the attorney's client. Therefore, the attorney-client privilege does not apply to prevent the accountant from testifying about statements made by the taxpayer.\n\n(B) inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nExplanation: The privilege against self-incrimination protects individuals from being compelled to be witnesses against themselves in criminal proceedings. In this case, the taxpayer is not being criminally prosecuted, but is instead contesting an individual income tax assessment. Therefore, the privilege against self-incrimination does not apply to prevent the taxpayer from testifying.\n\n(C) inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.\n\nExplanation: The work-product rule protects documents and other materials prepared in anticipation of litigation from discovery by the opposing party. In this case, the accountant was not preparing a financial statement in anticipation of litigation, but instead was preparing a statement to help the taxpayer in contesting the assessment. Therefore, the work-product rule does not apply to prevent the accountant from testifying.\n\n(D) admissible as an admission.\n\nExplanation: An admission is a statement made by a party that is offered to prove the truth of the statement. In this case, if the taxpayer made statements to the accountant that are offered as evidence to prove that the taxpayer underpaid her income tax, those statements would be admissible as an admission.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) admissible as an admission.",

            "model_answer": "The question is about a resident who failed to obtain enough authenticating signatures to have their name placed on a state's ballot. A law in the state requires new political entrants (regardless of party affiliation) to obtain three times the number of signatures as other candidates who have run for office previously. The resident filed a complaint in federal district court alleging the unconstitutionality of the authenticating requirement. The state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticating requirement would be:\n\n(C) The authenticating requirement was necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The first option, (A), about a large number of false signatures, indicates the difficulty of getting authenticating signatures, not the need for the requirement.\n* The second option, (B), about a similar statute in another state, is irrelevant to establishing the legitimacy of the requirement in the present state.\n* The third option, (D), that other candidates were successful in petitioning to have their names included on the ballot, does not address why the authenticating requirement is necessary.\n* The remaining option, (C), that the authenticating requirement was necessary to further a compelling state interest, is the strongest argument. The state has a compelling interest in ensuring a fair and free election for its citizens. Requiring authenticating signatures is a way to maintain the integrity of the democratic process and reduce fraud. Specifically, the requirement helps to ensure that the signatures are valid, the person signing is who they claim to be, and that they had a genuine intent to sign.\n\nAnswer:\n\n(C)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is not obvious from the given information. Therefore we need to look more closely at each option.\n\n(A) If a defendant's statement was involuntary it should not be admitted as evidence because it was made under duress. The defendant may have felt forced to admit guilt even if he or she is not guilty simply to stop the police from using further duress. Or it may have been made involuntarily due to a mental condition or intoxication. Or it may have been made involuntarily due to a police induced belief that incriminating oneself doesn't matter because the police already know it. Only voluntary confessions can prove guilt because involuntary confessions may be simply an attempt to stop the duress. Mandatory confessions that will stop the duress doesn't mean you are actually guilty.\n(B) If the defendant's statement was voluntary it may be admitted as evidence simply because the defendant volunteered the information, doesn't mean they are actually guilty. Voluntary statements are rarely easily proved falsehoods as why would someone volunteer falsehoods. But voluntary statements may not reflect the truth on the defendant's own beliefs as they may have been unknowingly contradicting themselves. The defendant may have even been a victim of police deception simply answering all questions just because the defendant thought they had to. Law must assume the defendant is an honest person that may not know the true facts well even when it is the police that is simply phrasing questions to get the assumed answers that they hope to hear.\n(C) If the defendant was not in custody then the police deprived themselves of the ability for an effective interrogation.
