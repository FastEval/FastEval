            "model_answer": "Certainly! Let's break down the question step-by-step.\n\n1. We know that a completely submerged object always displaces something.\n2. We have to choose between four options: weight, volume, density, or all of these.\n3. Let's first eliminate weight and volume. A submerged object may displace its own weight of fluid, but what about objects that are less dense than water? These objects would displace more than their own weight of fluid. Similarly, a submerged object may displace its own volume of fluid, but what about objects that are less dense than water? These objects would displace more than their own volume of fluid.\n4. The remaining option is density. A submerged object always displaces an amount of fluid that has the same density as itself.\n5. Therefore, the answer is (C) density of fluid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is (C) density of fluid.",

This means that higher frequency corresponds to more energy and shorter wavelength corresponds to more energy.\n2.
