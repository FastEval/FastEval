However, the efforts of Reconstruction were largely unsuccessful, and the aspirations of African Americans for true equality and citizenship were not fulfilled.\n\nOne of the major unfulfilled promises of Reconstruction was the promise of equal educational opportunities for African American children. The Southern states established separate schools for African American and white students, but the schools were often unequal in terms of resources, facilities, and quality of education.\n\nThe Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 was a landmark ruling that declared that segregation in public schools was inherently unequal and violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution.

Prior to the Proclamation, the Union's sole goal was to preserve the Union, but the Proclamation added a new goal: the abolition of slavery. This new goal broadened the Union's war aims and gave the conflict a more moralistic tone.\n\nSecondly, the Proclamation weakened the Confederacy by depriving it of a significant portion of its population and labor force. The Proclamation freed all slaves in Confederate territory, which reduced the South's ability to maintain its war effort. Many slaves left their plantations to seek refuge behind Union lines, where they could work for the Union as laborers or soldiers. This loss of manpower and resources undermined the Confederacy's ability to continue fighting.\n\nThirdly, the Proclamation had significant diplomatic implications. While it did not immediately cause Great Britain to join the Union's side, it increased tensions between the United States and several other European powers.
