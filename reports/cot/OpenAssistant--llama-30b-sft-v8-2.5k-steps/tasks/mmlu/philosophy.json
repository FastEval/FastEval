This is because Aesthetics is not solely concerned with the essential, but rather with the senses and emotions. Thus, options A and B are both eliminated. Option D is not related to aesthetics in itself and therefore is also eliminated. The only option that remains is C, which states that aesthetics deals with objects that are not essential to our existence. This is because aesthetics deals with objects that are not necessary for our survival but rather provide us with pleasure and enjoyment.",

Plato's views on beauty are found in several of his writings, including \"The Symposium\" and \"The Phaedrus.\"\n3. Plato believed that true beauty is not just something that is visible or tangible, but is an ideal form that exists outside of the physical world.\n4. In \"The Symposium,\" Aristophanes argues that love is the desire for beauty, and that humans are searching for their other half, which they recognize as beautiful.\n5. In \"The Phaedrus,\" Plato's character Socrates claims that true beauty can only be understood through reason and philosophical inquiry.\n\nNow, going back to the question, let's put together the pieces of information:\n\n* Plato's views on beauty are found in \"The Symposium\" and \"The Phaedrus.\"\n* Plato believed that true beauty is an ideal form that exists outside of the physical world.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) found in everyday objects\n(B) nonexistent\n(C) everywhere in the natural world\n(D) not of this world\n\n(*) aspect of reality, spiritual realm, transcendent.\n\nThe answer is (D) not of this world.",

In order to arrive at the correct answer, we will need to carefully analyze the text and make sure we understand the principles mentioned. \n\nPeter Singer is an Australian philosopher and author who has written extensively on animal rights and veganism. One of his principles is known as \"utilitarianism,\" which requires us to consider the well-being of all sentient beings, not just humans. In terms of our personal habits, this means avoiding products that cause unnecessary suffering to animals or the environment.\n\nIn \"Animal Liberation,\" Singer argues that our current use of animals for food, clothing, cosmetics, and other purposes is morally wrong because it causes needless pain and suffering to sentient beings. In order to be compliant with his principles, we need to make changes to our society as a whole so that it reflects a more ethical and sustainable approach to the natural world.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D) drastic changes to both our personal habits and to our society.**",

Socrates believed in the importance of knowledge and that a lack of knowledge leads to harm for the soul. This is evident in the quote: \"I know that I am intelligent, I know that I am capable of love, and I know that I am able to function in society. It seems that I am incapable of pity or remorse.\" In this quote, Socrates is expressing his belief that not having knowledge of morality can lead to negative emotions such as remorse.\n\nFurthermore, Socrates famously said \"I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing.\" This quote shows that he believed that knowledge of one's own ignorance is important for growth and avoiding harm to the soul.\n\nTherefore, the answer for Socrates is (A) knowledge.",
