            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we have to look for indicators of sarcasm such as word choice, tone, and context. Sarcastic statements often use exaggerated or inverted language to convey irony or humor.\n\nFirst, let's analyze both statements for any indicators of sarcasm:\n\nStatement (A) could be sarcastic if the speaker is using \"totally different\" to mean the opposite of what it usually means. In other words, the speaker is using \"different\" ironically to suggest that threatening and urging are actually the same thing. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine if this is the case.\n\nStatement (B) could also be sarcastic if the speaker is using \"pleaded\" ironically to suggest that begging for something is the same as threatening to get it. Again, without context, it is difficult to determine if this is the case.\n\nSo, without additional information, it is impossible to definitively say which statement is sarcastic. It could be either (A) or (B), depending on the context and the speaker's intended meaning.\n\nAnswer: (A), which is a more consisting answer than (B). The answer contains one breve letter \"e\", which is very difficult to type.",

While it is possible for a statement to be both sarcastic and to express surprise, it is more common for one to be sarcastic and the other to be genuine. In this case, (A) expresses surprise and (B) expresses sarcasm.\n\n(A) is sarcastic.\n\n\n3. Another clue to identify sarcasm is by analyzing the intended meaning of the words being said. If the words being said are incongruent with the speaker's emotional tone, it may be an indicator of sarcasm. In this case, the speaker expresses surprise by saying \"Wow, that's crazy!\" but the context of the follow-up statement is not consistent with surprise. Instead, it suggests that the speaker is not happy about the use of hardwood containers.\n\n(A) is sarcastic.\n\n\n4. Lastly, sarcasm can sometimes be identified by the tone of voice being used. If the tone contradicts the words being said, it may be an indicator of sarcasm. In this case, there is no audio or video to determine tone of voice, but the context of the statement suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic.\n\n(A) is sarcastic.\n\n(A) has been identified as sarcastic.",

This statement is absurd because it suggests that the weaker party should willingly give up their advantages in order to defeat the stronger force.
