            "model_answer": "The sarcastic statement is (B).\n\nHere is my reasoning:\n\nWe are given two statements about the same person, one stating that they are generous and promoting a charity stream, and the other stating that they are terrible. If we assume that both statements are true, we would expect the person to either be generous or terrible, but not both. This inconsistency suggests that one of the statements is false.\n\nHowever, we are told that one of the statements is sarcastic. Sarcasm is a form of irony that is used to express a negative sentiment or meaning by stating the opposite. In this case, the true statement is that the person is generous and promoting a charity stream, which raises money to help kids in need. The sarcastic statement is the one that claims that the person is terrible, which contradicts the true statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n(B) He's a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need",

            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we can look for clues in the phrasing and context. \n\nFirst, let's examine the two statements:\n\nA) \"Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it okay.\"\nB) \"Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it toxic.\"\n\nOne possible indication of sarcasm is the use of irony or exaggeration to make a point. If one of the two statements is using a sarcastic tone, it may be using hyperbole or contradiction to make a point or express an opinion.\n\nLooking at the two statements, we can see that both are making a comment about racism and its consequences. Statement A suggests that racism is acceptable if it is only being performed as a joke or meme. Statement B, on the other hand, suggests that racism is always toxic.\n\nBased on the content of the two statements, it appears that Statement A is the sarcastic one. Its message is contrary to what most people would recognise as acceptable behavior, and it uses a flippant tone to make a comment about racism. By suggesting that racism is acceptable as long as it is only being performed as a joke or meme, Statement A is using irony to make a criticising point about racism and its consequences. \n\nAnswer: (A) Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it okay.",

            "correct_answer": "(A)",
            "model_answer": "(A) He didn't threaten, he only urged; totally different.\n\nThis statement is likely sarcastic because the phrase \"totally different\" is used in a way that suggests the opposite is true. \"Urged\" and \"threatened\" can have similar connotations, and the use of the phrase \"totally different\" implies that the two actions are actually quite similar. Additionally, the use of the word \"only\" to describe the person's actions could suggest that the speaker is downplaying or dismissing the severity of the situation.",

The second option mentions plastic containers, which is a more common and less sustainable material compared to hardwood.\n4. Therefore, it is implied that the speaker would prefer the takeout meal with the hardwood container over the one with the plastic container.\n5. The speaker's response in the first option is overly enthusiastic given the situation. It is unlikely that the speaker has never had a takeout meal that used hardwood containers before, as this is not a common occurrence.\n6.

            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to consider the context in which the statements were made. Sarcasm is often used to convey irony or a facetious observation, and it is typically characterized by a statement that appears to be a compliment, but is actually meant to be critical or insulting.\n\nBased on this, we can analyze the two statements as follows:\n\n(A) Have you tried not being poor? It is much easier\n\nThis statement could be sarcastic if the speaker is implying that being poor is not a real problem, and that the person who is struggling financially should simply try harder to not be poor.\n\n(B) Have you tried not being rude? It is much easier\n\nSimilarly, this statement could be sarcastic if the speaker is implying that being rude is not a real problem, and that the person who is behaving rudely should simply try harder to not be rude.\n\nTo determine which statement is more likely to be sarcastic, we need to consider the context and the intended meaning of the statements.\n\nBased on this analysis, I cannot definitively identify which statement is sarcastic without more context. However, if I had to guess, I would say that statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic than statement (B).\n\nThe answer is (A).\n\n(Notes: The fact that the task is written is clearly sarcastic, as it is impossible for a human to follow the task as written without lingering on each step for at least half an hour.

Both statements (A) and (B) could potentially be sarcastic depending on the context and tone of voice.\n2. However, if we assume a standard tone of voice, we can look at therelative complexityof working a microprocessor versus a printer.\n3. Working a printer is generally seen as easier than working a microprocessor, particularly for individuals who are not tech-savvy or who do not have experience with electronics.\n4. Therefore, if someone were to say that working the printer is too complex for them, it may not necessarily be sarcastic as it could be a genuine statement of their ability level.\n5. On the other hand, microprocessors are generally seen as more complex than printers and require a higher level of technical expertise.\n6. Therefore, if someone were to say that working the microprocessor is too complex for them, it could potentially be sarcastic as they are making a statement that indicates their ability is lower than what is generally expected.\n7. The final answer is (B) Working the microprocessor is too complex for me.",

We are given two options, both seemingly sarcastic. Let's analyze each one to determine which is more likely meant as sarcasm.\n2. (A) refers to \"feeding elephants,\" which could potentially be seen as an altruistic or positive action. The phrase \"endangered species\" makes it clear that the speaker recognizes the importance of elephant conservation. This suggests a tone of sincerity.\n3. (B) refers to \"feeding trolls,\" which is likely meant to be negative. The phrase \"endangered species\" in this context feels incongruent; trolls are not a real endangered species. This suggests a tone of sarcasm.\n4. Overall, the use of a non-endangered species (trolls) paired with a facetious tone makes (B) the more likely sarcastic statement.\n\nAnswer: (B) You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the trolls, that woefully endangered species.",
