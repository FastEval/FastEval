If Leslie had gone to the clothing store at any time after 11am, Jason would have seen them. Therefore, the latest time that Leslie could have gone to the clothing store is 11am.\n\nFinally, we know that David saw Leslie attending class at the school from 6pm to 10pm. If Leslie had gone to the clothing store at any time during this timeframe, David would have seen them. Therefore, the earliest time that Leslie could have gone to the clothing store is 6pm.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n(D) 6pm to 10pm",
