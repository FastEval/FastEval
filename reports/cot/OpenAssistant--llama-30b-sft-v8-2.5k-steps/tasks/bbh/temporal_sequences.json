This tells us that James was at least at the cafe at 4pm.\n\nLastly, we know that the beach was closed after 9pm, which is the latest James could have gone to the beach.\n\nBased on this information, we can rule out any time frame that occurs before 7am, since James was at the Statue of Liberty by 6am.
