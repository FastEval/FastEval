            "correct_answer": "(C)",
            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\nFirst, we need to look at the common elements between the movies Batman, The Mask, The Fugitive, and Pretty Woman. All of these movies are action-oriented and feature a clear protagonist and antagonist, with obvious good and evil roles. They also have elements of comedy and romance, with the male and female leads having a romantic relationship that develops throughout the movie, even if it is not the main focus.\n\nNext, we look at the options given and see which one most closely matches the common elements of the original movies. The Front Page is a comedy and a remake of the 1931 film of the same name, which follows two reporters who fabricate a story about Charlie Foster, a convicted murderer who is on the run. It does not match the criteria of an action-oriented movie with obvious good and evil roles.\n\nMaelstrom is an adventure and psychological horror film, which follows a rescue mission leader and his crew as they fragment and lose their minds while trying to save a group of stranded travelers during a storm. It also does not match the criteria of having a clear protagonist and antagonist, with obvious good and evil roles, as well as having elements of comedy and romance.\n\nThe Lion King is an animated musical film, which follows the life of a young lion named Simba as he grows up and takes his rightful place as king of the Pride Lands. While it has elements of action and drama, it does not have an obvious romantic relationship between the male and female leads, and it does not have a clear protagonist and antagonist with obvious good and evil roles.\n\nLamerica is an Italian neorealist film, which follows a group of emigrants from Lazio, Italy who travel to Venezuela in search of better opportunities. While it has elements of drama and social commentary, it does not match the criteria of having a clear protagonist and antagonist, with obvious good and evil roles, as well as having elements of action and romance.\n\nSince none of the options satisfy all the common elements of the original movies, there is no perfect match. However, the option that comes closest is (C) The Lion King because it has elements of action and drama, with memorable characters and a classic hero's journey storyline. However, it does not have the obvious romantic relationship between the male and female leads that is present in the other movies.\n\nAnswer: (C) The Lion King.",

These factors could include themes, tone, genre, and style.\n\nFor The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, and Terminator 2 Judgment Day, we can look at their genre classifications and see that they are all science fiction or action movies.\n\nForrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption are dramas, but they also share a similar tone of hope, perseverance, and redemption.\n\nWith this in mind, the options we have to consider for a movie similar to The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, Forrest Gump, and The Shawshank Redemption are:\n\n(A) Street Fighter II The Animated Movie\n sci-fi action movie, but not necessarily with the same themes and tone\n\n(B) The Sheltering Sky\n drama that explores themes of mortality and the human condition\n\n(C) The Boy Who Could Fly\n drama that explores themes of imagination and overcoming adversity\n\n(D) Terminator 2 Judgment Day science fiction action movie, but not necessarily with the same themes and tone\n\nGiven all these factors, the movie that comes closest to being similar to The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, Forrest Gump, and The Shawshank Redemption is:\n\n(D) Terminator 2 Judgment Day",

Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\nSchindler's List, Braveheart, and Tombstone are all historical dramas that explore significant events and characters from the past.\nThe Silence of the Lambs, while also critically acclaimed, is a psychological thriller that follows a young FBI agent on her first case.\nGuilty of Romance and Orlando are not similar in genre or style to the other options, as they are a Japanese psychosexual movie and a historical fantasy film, respectively.\nForrest Gump is a comedy-drama that explores the life of a man with an intellectual disability as he navigates events and cultural movements of the 20th century.\nAll the Real Girls is a romantic drama that follows a young man as he falls in love with a woman for who she truly is, rather than who he wants her to be.\n\nAlthough All the Real Girls is a different genre and style of movie than Schindler's List, Braveheart, The Silence of the Lambs, and Tombstone, it shares a common element of exploring complex and deeply human themes in a realistic and thought-provoking way. Therefore, I would recommend All the Real Girls as the answer.",
