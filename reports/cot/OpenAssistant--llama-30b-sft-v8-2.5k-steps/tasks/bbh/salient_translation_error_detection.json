The source text describes a weapon system, the FZ90, which is used on fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters.\n2. The source text includes specific information about the weapon system, including its diameter and intended platform.\n3. The source text specifies that the FZ90 is an \"ungelenkte\" (unguided) missile, suggesting that it requires a separate guidance system to direct its course.\n4. The source text describes the FZ90 as a \"Luft-Boden-Rakete\" (air-to-surface missile), which is further specified as a type of \"ungelenkte 70-mm-Luft-Boden-Rakete\" (unguided 70-mm air-to-surface rocket).\n5. The source text does not mention the use of aircraft or helicopters, though it does specify that the missile is fired from a fixed-wing aircraft or helicopter.\n\nBased on this information, the error in the translation is most likely to be a change in meaning rather than a simple mistake in numerical values or named entities. The fact that the missile is described as \"ungelenkt\" and \" ungesteuert\" in the German source text, yet is translated as \"guided\" and \"air-to-surface\" in the English version, suggests that the error falls under category (C) Nnegation or Antonyms.",
