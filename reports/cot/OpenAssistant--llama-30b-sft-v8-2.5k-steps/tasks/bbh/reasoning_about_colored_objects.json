We can see that the colors that are not mentioned in the list of options are the colors of the items listed. The fuchsia pencil is colored in fuchsia, the mauve stress ball is colored in mauve, the blue teddy bear is colored in blue, and the gold necklace is colored in gold. Therefore, the color of the thing directly to the right of the mauve stress ball is one of the colors in the list of options.\n\nNext, we can analyze the list of options further to determine which color is the most likely answer. We can see that the color that is listed the closest to the right of the mauve option is the gold option. This suggests that the color of the thing directly to the right of the mauve stress ball is probably gold or one of the colors that is closer to the right of gold on the list.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\nK) turquoise",
