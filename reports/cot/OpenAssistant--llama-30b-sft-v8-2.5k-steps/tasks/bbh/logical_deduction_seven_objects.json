For example, we know that Ana finished above Ada, so we can place Ana in either A or B and Ada in either B or C. Likewise, we know that Amy finished last, so we can place her in position F. We continue this process until all of the golfers are accounted for.\n* After filling in the table, the only order that makes sense is (D) Dan finished third:\n\n\tA\tB\tC\tD\tE\tF\tG\nAna\tEve\tAda\tDan\tEve\tAmy\tJoe\n\nTherefore, Dan finished third.",

For example, we can write \"motorcycle > truck\" to denote that the motorcycle is newer than the truck. We can then define a total order using the \"greater than\" relation by transitivity: \"a > b and b > c\" implies \"a > c\".\n\nUsing this approach, we can deduce the ages of the vehicles as follows:\n\n* The limousine is the oldest, because it is the only vehicle that the truck is newer than.\n* The minivan is newer than the limousine because it is newer than the bus.\n* The bus is newer than the minivan and the truck because it is newer than the limousine.\n* The truck is older than the bus and the limousine.\n* The hatchback is newest among the remaining vehicles (bus, truck, limousine, station wagon, motorcycle) because it is younger than the minivan.\n* The station wagon is younger than all the remaining vehicles except for the hatchback, so it is the fourth-newest.\n* The motorcycle is the fifth-newest because it is newer than the truck but older than the station wagon.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) The hatchback is the third-oldest.",

Let's start by identifying some key pieces of information:\n\n* \"The peaches are the cheapest.\" - This means that peaches are the least expensive fruit at the stand.\n* \"The apples are the second-cheapest.\" - This means that apples are the second least expensive fruit after peaches.\n* \"The plums are the fourth-most expensive.\" - This means that plums are the fourth most expensive fruit, with three fruits being more expensive.\n* \"The kiwis are more expensive than the mangoes.\" - This means that kiwis are pricier than mangoes.\n* \"The oranges are less expensive than the mangoes.\" - This means that oranges are less expensive than mangoes.\n\nGiven this information, we can create a directed graph with each fruit as a vertex and directed edges indicating which fruits are more or less expensive than each other:\npeaches < apples < oranges < kiwis < mangoes < loquats < plums\nNext, we'll look at each option to determine which fruit is the third cheapest:\n\n* Option A - The oranges are the third-cheapest: If we follow the directed edges in our graph from the third-cheapest fruit, we reach oranges, which are less expensive than the mangoes. Since mangoes are more expensive than the second-cheapest apples, oranges must be the third-cheapest fruit. Therefore, option A is correct.\n* Option B - The loquats are the third-cheapest: If we follow the directed edges in our graph from the third-cheapest fruit, we reach loquats, which are less expensive than the kiwis. However, kiwis are more expensive than the mangoes, which are more expensive than the second-cheapest apples. Therefore, loquats cannot be the third-cheapest fruit. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n* Option C - The apples are the third-cheapest: If we follow the directed edges in our graph from the third-cheapest fruit, we reach apples, which are the second-cheapest fruit. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n* Option D - The kiwis are the third-cheapest: If we follow the directed edges in our graph from the third-cheapest fruit, we reach kiwis, which are more expensive than the mangoes. However, mangoes are less expensive than the second-cheapest apples. Therefore, kiwis cannot be the third-cheapest fruit. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n* Option E - The mangoes are the third-cheapest: If we follow the directed edges in our graph from the third-cheapest fruit, we reach the mangoes, which are less expensive than the second-cheapest apples. However, oranges are less expensive than the mangoes, and we've already determined that oranges are the third-cheapest fruit. Therefore, mangoes cannot be the third-cheapest fruit. Therefore, option E is incorrect.\n* Option F - The plums are the third-cheapest: If we follow the directed edges in our graph from the third-cheapest fruit, we reach the plums, which are the fourth-most expensive fruit. Therefore, option F is incorrect.\n* Option G - The peaches are the third-cheapest: If we follow the directed edges in our graph from the third-cheapest fruit, we reach peaches, which are the cheapest fruit.

            "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Joe, Dan, Ana, Mel, Ada, Eve, and Amy. Eve finished above Amy. Dan finished second. Ada finished below Ana. Ana finished third-to-last. Mel finished last. Amy finished third.\nOptions:\n(A) Joe finished last\n(B) Dan finished last\n(C) Ana finished last\n(D) Mel finished last\n(E) Ada finished last\n(F) Eve finished last\n(G) Amy finished last",
            "correct_answer": "(D)",
            "model_answer": "Let us analyse the given information step-by-step:\n\n1. The first sentence tells us that there were seven golfers: Joe, Dan, Ana, Mel, Ada, Eve, and Amy.\n2. The next sentence tells us that Eve finished above Amy. This means that Eve's position is higher than Amy's.\n3. The third sentence tells us that Dan finished second. This means that Dan's position is higher than every golfer except the first one.\n4. The fourth sentence tells us that Ada finished below Ana. This means that Ada's position is lower than Ana's.\n5. The fifth sentence tells us that Ana finished third-to-last. This means that Ana's position is higher than only Mel's.\n6. The sixth sentence tells us that Mel finished last.\n7. The final sentence tells us that Amy finished third.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that Joe's position is higher than other golfers' positions, and Eve's position is higher than Amy's position.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n1. Option A states that Joe finished last. However, from the analysis above, we know that Joe's position is higher than other golfers', so this option is incorrect.\n2. Option B states that Dan finished last. However, as per the analysis above, we know that Dan finished second, so this option is incorrect.\n3. Option C states that Ana finished last. However, as per the analysis above, Ana finished third-to-last, so this option is incorrect.\n4. Option D states that Mel finished last. However, as per the analysis above, we know that Mel finished last, so this option is correct.\n5. Option E states that Ada finished last. However, as per the analysis above, Ada's position is lower than Ana's position, so this option is incorrect.\n6. Option F states that Eve finished last. However, as per the analysis above, we know that Eve's position is higher than Amy's position, so this option is incorrect.\n7. Option G states that Amy finished last. However, as per the analysis above, we know that Amy finished third, so this option is incorrect.\n\nThus, the answer is D) Mel finished last.",

            "model_answer": "(C) The robin is the third from the right\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The paragraph describes a branch with seven birds arranged in a fixed order: a raven, a hummingbird, a robin, a crow, a quail, a blue jay, and a cardinal.\n* The hummingbird is to the left of the crow, so the crow must be in the middle or to the right of the arrangement.\n* The quail is to the right of the crow, so the crow must be to the left of the quail (since the hummingbird is on the left side). Therefore, the arrangement must be: DNSQAB etc. (where D is the raven, N is the hummingbird, S is the crow, Q is the quail, A is the robin, B is the blue jay, and etc. is the cardinal).\n* The raven is to the left of the robin, so the arrangement must start with R, else we would have a contradiction.\n* The blue jay is the third from the right, so the cardinal must be the first bird on the left, the hummingbird must be the second bird from the left, and the robin must be the third bird from the left.\n* Therefore, the final arrangement is RNESQAB.\n9. (C) The robin is the third from the right.\n\nAnswer:\nRNESQAB",
