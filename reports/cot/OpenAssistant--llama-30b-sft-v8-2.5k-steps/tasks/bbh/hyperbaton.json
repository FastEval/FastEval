In sentence A, the adjectives are 'normal-size', 'white', 'Pakistani', and 'good'. In sentence B, the adjectives are 'good', 'normal-size', 'white', and 'Pakistani'.\n\nNext, we will apply the adjective order rules to each sentence. Adjectives that describe the same attribute usually follow the following order: general to specific. For example, if we were describing a bookshelf, we would use 'large', 'wooden', and 'open' in that order.\n\nIn sentence A, the order of the adjectives is 'normal-size', 'white', 'Pakistani', and 'good'. The adjectives describing the 'normal-size' and 'white' attributes come before the adjective describing the 'Pakistani' attribute, which is specific to the noun (Pakistani). The adjective describing the 'good' attribute is last because it is the most general and is also an evaluative adjective, which describes the quality of the noun.\n\nIn sentence B, the order of the adjectives is 'good', 'normal-size', 'white', and 'Pakistani'. The adjective describing the 'good' attribute is first, which is appropriate because it is both evaluative and the most specific. The order of the other adjectives follows the general to specific rule, with 'normal-size' and 'white' coming before the adjective describing the 'Pakistani' attribute.\n\nIn summary, both sentences are missing one adjective that describes the noun (paper). Assuming it is necessary, the correct order for a complete sentence might be: 'Pakistani normal-size white good snorkeling paper monkey.' A minor mistake in the sentence is the use of a plural noun (papers) instead of the singular noun (paper). Assuming that was intended, the correct sentence is: 'Pakistani normal-size white good snorkeling paper monkeys.'",

The first adjective should describe the main quality or characteristic of the noun it is describing.
