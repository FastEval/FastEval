To solve it, we can draw a directed graph where each vertex represents a book and each directed edge represents a swap between two people. Let the vertices be labeled U, F, and L, corresponding to Ulysses, Frankenstein, and Lolita respectively. The edges can be represented by the triples (A, B, C) where A and B are the individuals who are swapping books and C is the book that is being swapped. For example, the first swap (Claire, Bob) can be represented by the edge (C, F). Similarly, the swap (Bob, Alice) can be represented by the edge (F, U), and the swap (Bob, Claire) can be represented by the edge (U, L). Now, we can try to follow the flow of books from the initial assignments to the final book that Bob has. Ulysses is assigned to Alice, Frankenstein to Claire, and Lolita is assigned to Bob. After the first swap, Frankenstein is assigned to Claire and Ulysses is assigned to Bob. After the second swap, Ulysses is assigned to Alice and Frankenstein is assigned to Bob. Finally, after the third swap, Lolita is assigned to Bob. Therefore, Bob ends up with Lolita, the answer is (C).",
