Ignoring the \"second from the left\" part, think of a \"left-to-right\" ordering. This would lead to \"quail on the left, followed by blue jay in the center and falcon on the right.\"\n3.

The first sentence says: \"On a shelf, there are three books: a blue book, an orange book, and a red book. The blue book is the rightmost.\" This sentence tells us that there are three books, the blue one is on the right side, and the other book must be on its left, but the orange book isn't mentioned as being on the left or right.\n2. The second sentence says: \"The orange book is the leftmost.\" This sentence confirms that the orange book is indeed on the left side of the blue one, and the red book must be on the right.\n3. The paragraph only talks about the position of the books, so we shouldn't consider their colour.\n4. Now, looking at the options given, A states that the blue book is the second from the left, which contradicts the information given in the second sentence, as the orange book clearly is the second from the left. B also contradicts the given information, as the orange book is the leftmost. C also contradicts the first sentence, as the blue book would be the first book from the left.\n\nSo, with this reasoning, the answer is:\n(B) The orange book is the second from the left.",

In this case, their positions are right, robin, blue jay, crow, and left.\n\nFrom (1) and (3), we can infer that the blue jay is placed on the right side of the robin, which means that the birds on the branch are laid out as follows: rightmost-robin-blue jay-crow-least (denoted as RRbJCCl).  From (2) and (3), we can infer that the blue jay is placed to the left of the crow, which means that the birds on the branch are laid out as follows: rightmost-blue jay-robin-crow-least (denoted as RbJRcC). \n\nHowever, we can also see that the crow is placed to the right of the blue jay according to (3).
