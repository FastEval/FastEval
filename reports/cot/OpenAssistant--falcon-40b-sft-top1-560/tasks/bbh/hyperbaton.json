            "model_answer": "Didn't you answer your own question?\nHere is some more information you might need:\nAdjectives modify nouns. The order in which you place the adjectives is important to their meaning. You should follow this general rule when deciding the order of multiple adjectives:\n\n1 Order of quality: Adjectives that describe the quality of the noun should come before those that describe its size, shape, color, or material. This means that you should prioritize adjectives that give information about the noun\u2019s value or significance over those that only describe its appearance.\n2 Adjectives of different types: If you have more than one adjective that describes quality, put them in order from most important to least important to the noun. If you have descriptors from more than one category (e.g., both a quality and a size adjective), follow this order:\n\nThe order of importance is:\nOpinion\nSize\nAge\nShape\nColor\nOrigin/material\nQualifier (usually ending in -ly)\nNumber\nPurpose\n3 Proper adjective order: When using a proper adjective (one formed from a place name), follow this order:\n\nQualifying adjective + Noun + Geographic adjective\nExamples:\n\nItalian pizza\nTexas oil\n4 Adjectives of equal value: If you have several adjectives that are all describing the noun in the same way, the order doesn\u2019t particularly matter. However, there may be cases where you want to emphasize one adjective over the others. In these cases, you can change the order to place the more emphasized adjective closer to the noun.\n\nHere is some more information you might need:\n\n1 In American English, compound adjectives that modify a noun are hyphenated when used before the noun, but closed up when used after the noun. Examples:\n\nCorrect: a dark-skinned boy\nIncorrect: a dark skinned boy\nCorrect: The boy has dark-skinned parents.\n\n\n2 When using multiple adjectives of the same type to describe a noun, you can usually separate them with commas.\n\nExample:\n\nHe wore a long, yellow, and furry costume.\n3 Don\u2019t use \u201cvery\u201d and \u201creally\u201d as modifying adjectives. They are usually best used as intensifiers after adverbs such as \u201creally well\u201d or \u201cvery fast.\u201d These intensifiers tend to weaken the impact of the adjective they modify.",

When there are only two adjectives, the order is generally subjective.\n2. When there are three or more adjectives, they should generally follow this order:\nopinion - size - shape - colour - origin - material - purpose\n3. When two or more adjectives could go in more than one position, the order is determined by their meaning.\n\nApplying these rules to the given options:\n\n(A) rubber gray walking Mexican midsize cat\n\nOption (A) has four adjectives: \"rubber\", \"gray\", \"Mexican\", and \"midsize\". Following the above rules:\n\n1. Since there are only two adjectives, the order is subjective. However, \"midsize\" is usually considered a more important descriptor than \"walking\", so the order should be \"midsize walking cat\".\n2. Option (A) does not have three or more adjectives, so this rule does not apply.\n3. Since \"midsize\" and \"Mexican\" could go in more than one position, we need to consider their meaning. \"Mexican\" is an origin descriptor, and \"midsize\" is a size descriptor. Origin descriptors usually come before size descriptors, so the order should be \"Mexican midsize walking cat\".\n\nThis means that Option (A) does not have the correct adjective order.\n\n(B) midsize gray Mexican rubber walking cat\n\nOption (B) also has four adjectives: \"midsize\", \"gray\", \"Mexican\", and \"rubber\".

            "model_answer": "To determine the correct adjective order in the given sentences, we need to consider the following rules:\n\n    1. When there are only two adjectives, they are usually placed before and after the noun they modify. For example: \"I like the big red ball.\" In this sentence, \"big\" and \"red\" are the adjectives, and they describe the noun \"ball.\"\n\n    2. When there are more than two adjectives, they are usually placed in the following order:\n\n        1. Opinion or value\n\n        2. Size\n\n        3. Shape\n\n        4. Color\n\n        5. Nationality or material\n\n        6. Purpose\n\n    3. There are some exceptions to these rules, but they are only used for artistic reasons.\n\nBased on these rules, we can analyze the two options given:\n\nOption A: \"medium-size prismlike grey cardboard cat\"\nIn this option, the adjectives are placed in the following order:\n\n    1. Size - \"medium-size\"\n\n    2. Shape - \"prismlike\"\n\n    3. Color - \"grey\"\n\n    4. Material - \"cardboard\"\n\n    5. Purpose - \"cat\"\n\nOption B: \"prismlike cardboard grey medium-size cat\"\nIn this option, the adjectives are placed in the following order:\n\n    1. Shape - \"prismlike\"\n\n    2. Color - \"grey\"\n\n    3. Material - \"cardboard\"\n\n    4. Size - \"medium-size\"\n\n    5. Purpose - \"cat\"\n\nAfter analyzing both options, we can see that Option B follows the correct adjective order, while Option A does not. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B.",

            "model_answer": "Both of these are grammatically correct, but (A) is the correct adjective order.

Finally, \"walking\" describes the purpose of the surfboard, and is the least important descriptor, so it comes last.\n\nIn the sentence \"walking lead new white surfboard\", the order is incorrect. \"Walking\" should come last, as it is the least important descriptor, and \"new\" should come before \"white\" because the colour of an object is an important descriptor.",

            "model_answer": "The correct adjective order for this sentence would be (B), \"mysterious ancient yellow walking cat.\"\n\nIn a descriptive phrase, there is a standard order for placing adjectives in front of a noun.

Indefinite or demonstrative adjective: a/an, this, these, that, those\n3. Number: singular or plural\n4. Quality: color, size, shape, origin, material, age, purpose, or any other describing word\n5. Degree: comparative or superlative (e.g., -er, -est, or more, most)\n6. Proper adjective: names of specific people, places, or things\n7. Noun phrase modifiers: prepositional phrases, participial phrases, or infinitive phrases\n\nHere is a breakdown of why (B) is the correct answer:\n\n\"Mysterious\" is a determiner and is correctly placed first.\n\n\"Ancient\" is an indefinite adjective and is correctly placed second.\n\n\"Yellow\" is a color, which is a quality adjective, and is correctly placed third.\n\n\"Walking\" is a participial phrase that modifies the noun \"cat,\" and is correctly placed fourth.\n\n\"Cat\" is the noun that is being described, and is correctly placed fifth.",

Or is this a problem in the domain of computer vision, where the adjectives describe some physical object?\n\nAssuming this is a language-based problem, let's consider the following word order:\n\nAdjective + Noun + Modifier\n\nWe could further refine this to put quantifiers in front of the adjective since those modify the noun:\n\nDeterminer + Adjective + Noun + Modifier\n\nIn both cases, the word order should be the same regardless of the adjectives used.\n\nWith those ground rules in mind, let's look at sentence (A):\n\n(A) rectangular silver ancient green ridiculous big knife\n\nWe can parse this sentence as:\n\n(Determiner: rectangular) (Adjective: silver) (Noun: knife) (Modifier: ancient green ridiculous big)\n\nwhere \"knife\" is the noun, \"silver ancient green ridiculous big\" is the modifier, and \"rectangular\" is a determiner but not part of the modifier.\n\nSince the determiner is modifying the noun, not the adjective, we can safely ignore that for now.\n\nNow let's look at sentence (B):\n\n(B) ridiculous big ancient rectangular green silver knife\n\nWe can parse this sentence as:\n\n(Determiner: ridiculous big) (Adjective: ancient) (Noun: silver green rectangular knife) (Modifier: none)\n\nSince the verb is omitted, we can safely assume that this is a basic sentence without any additional modification.\n\nFrom the parsing of the two sentences, we can see that:\n\n(A) has a determiner modifying the noun \"knife\", but no adjective modifying the noun.\n\n(B) has an adjective modifying the noun \"silver green rectangular knife\", but no determiner modifying the noun.\n\nSince both sentences describe the same noun, we can conclude that (B) is the correct answer.",
