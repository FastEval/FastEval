Finally, we compare the two cumulative ages to determine the correct answer.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the tables above:\n\nFor the penguins, we can extract the age and weight columns as follows:\n\n```\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\nLouis, 7, 50, 11\nBernard, 5, 80, 13\nVincent, 9, 60, 11\nGwen, 8, 70, 15\n```\n\nFor the giraffes, we can extract the age column as follows:\n\n```\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg)\nJody, 5, 430, 620\nGladys, 10, 420, 590\nMarian, 2, 310, 410\nDonna, 9, 440, 650\n```\n\n\nNext, we need to convert the ages into integers.

We start by scanning through the table and creating a dictionary to store the information of each penguin, with their name as the key and a tuple with their age, height, and weight as the value: ```Python\npenguins = {}\nfor line in table:\n    penguin_info = line.split(',')\n    name, age, height, weight = int(penguin_info[0]), int(penguin_info[1]), float(penguin_info[2]), float(penguin_info[3])\n    penguins[name] = (age, height, weight)\n``` \nAfter this step, our dictionary should contain the following information for each penguin: ```Python\n{'Bernard': (5, 80, 13), 'Gwen': (8, 70, 15), 'Louis': (7, 50, 11)}\n``` \n\n2. We then locate the penguin named \"Bernard\" in the dictionary and delete it: ```Python\nif 'Bernard' in penguins:\n    del penguins['Bernard']\n``` \n\nAfter this step, our dictionary should contain the following information for each penguin: ```Python\n{'Gwen': (8, 70, 15), 'Louis': (7, 50, 11)}\n``` \n\n3. We now count the number of penguins that meet the given criteria. To do this, we create an empty list and use a for loop to iterate through each item in the dictionary. If the item's age is greater than 5 and their weight is greater than 12, we add the item's name to our list: ```Python\nresult = []\nfor name, info in penguins.items():\n    if info[0] > 5 and info[2] > 12:\n        result.append(name)\n``` \nAfter this step, our list should contain the following names: ```Python\n['Gwen', 'Louis']\n``` \nAnd therefore the correct answer is (B).",
