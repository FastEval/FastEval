List the known events in chronological order:\n    - Betty wakes up at 8am\n    - Elizabeth sees Betty buying lunch at the deli from 8am to 10am\n    - Tiffany sees Betty fixing their computer at the electronic store from 10am to 1pm\n    - Susan sees Betty taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 1pm to 2pm\n    - Betty gets a coffee at the cafe from 7pm to 10pm\n    - The art show is closed after 10pm\n\n2. For each event, determine the possible time range in which it could have occurred:\n    - Betty wakes up at 8am: This event must have occurred at or after 8am.\n    - Elizabeth sees Betty buying lunch at the deli from 8am to 10am: This event must have occurred during the time interval [8am, 10am].\n    - Tiffany sees Betty fixing their computer at the electronic store from 10am to 1pm: This event must have occurred during the time interval [10am, 1pm].\n    - Susan sees Betty taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 1pm to 2pm: This event must have occurred during the time interval [1pm, 2pm].\n    - Betty gets a coffee at the cafe from 7pm to 10pm: This event must have occurred during the time interval [7pm, 10pm].\n    - The art show is closed after 10pm: This event must have occurred at or before 10pm.\n\n3. Identify the overlapping time intervals:\n    - Elizabeth sees Betty buying lunch at the deli from 8am to 10am and\n    Tiffany sees Betty fixing their computer at the electronic store from 10am to 1pm:\n    These two events both occur during the time interval [10am, 1pm].\n    - Susan sees Betty taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 1pm to 2pm and\n    Betty gets a coffee at the cafe from 7pm to 10pm:\n    These two events both occur during the time interval [7pm, 10pm].\n\n4. Determine the potential time range for Betty to have visited the art show:\n    - Since the art show is closed after 10pm, Betty could have visited the art show at any time before 10pm.\n    - Since Betty was seen getting a coffee at the cafe from 7pm to 10pm, she could not have visited the art show during this time interval.\n    - Since Betty was seen fixing her computer at the electronic store from 10am to 1pm, she could not have visited the art show during this time interval.\n    - Since Betty was seen buying lunch at the deli from 8am to 10am, she could have visited the art show during the time interval [10am, 1pm].\n\nBased on this analysis, the potential time range for Betty to have visited the art show is from 10am to 1pm. Therefore, the correct answer is option (C): 10am to 1pm.",
