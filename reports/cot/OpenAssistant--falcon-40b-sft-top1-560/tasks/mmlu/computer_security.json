They are likely to explore paths covering every line of code if the test cases they generate are diverse and cover a wide range of inputs. However, generational fuzzers can be limited in their ability to explore complex code paths and may not be effective in discovering deep-seated bugs.\n\nBlackbox fuzzers do not have any knowledge of the internal structure of the program being tested. They rely solely on random input generation and may not be effective in exploring paths that require specific input values. Blackbox fuzzers may struggle to cover every line of code if the program has complex input requirements or if there are large sections of code that are never reached based on the input provided.\n\nWhitebox fuzzers have knowledge of the internal structure of the program being tested and can generate inputs specifically designed to trigger different code paths. They are more likely to explore paths covering every line of code because they can generate inputs that target specific sections of code. However, whitebox fuzzers require access to the source code or a detailed specification of the program, and may not be suitable for testing closed-source or proprietary software.\n\nMutation-based fuzzers work by making small changes to existing inputs to create new inputs. They are likely to explore paths covering every line of code if the mutations they apply cause the program to behave differently. However, mutation-based fuzzers may not be effective in exploring complex code paths or in discovering deep-seated bugs.\n\nBased on this analysis, a whitebox fuzzer is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the given program. A whitebox fuzzer can be designed to target specific sections of code and can generate inputs that trigger different code paths. However, it is important to note that other factors such as the complexity of the code and the testing environment can also impact the effectiveness of a fuzzer in covering every line of code.",

            "question": "Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don\u2019t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.\n2. An attacker impersonating the server.\n\n(A) True, True\n(B) False, False\n(C) True, False\n(D) False, True",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is C - True, False.\n\nTLS protects against an attacker impersonating the server. TLS uses asymmetric cryptography, where the server has a private key and a public key. The client can use the server's public key to encrypt a message that only the server's private key can decrypt. This way, the server can be sure that a message is really from the client and not an attacker.\n\nHowever, TLS does not protect against an attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier. This is because TLS is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that once the connection is established, the data is sent as a continuous stream. An attacker can intercept the data and save it, then replay it later to the server. To protect against this type of attack, additional measures such as sequence numbers or message authentication codes (MACs) must be used.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Answer: C.\n\nExplanation:\n\nOption C is correct as it explains how the Kerberos server ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used. When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past. This ensures that expired tickets cannot be used to gain unauthorized access to resources on the network. Option A is incorrect as the Kerberos server does not actively refuse to establish new connections, but rather the server will reject any tickets that have expired. Option B is incorrect as there is no 24-hour timer set by the server to terminate the connection. Option D is incorrect as the server does not send a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid, but rather the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock to determine if the ticket is still valid.",

This can lead to a gradual depletion of available memory, potentially causing the program to crash or become vulnerable to attacks that exploit the exposed memory.\n\nBuffer-overrun refers to a situation where data written to a buffer exceeds its capacity, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations and corrupting program data. While this can lead to program instability and potential vulnerabilities, it is not directly related to the issue of memory leakage.\n\nInefficient programming can lead to poor performance and increased resource usage, but it is not a security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.\n\nTherefore, given the choices provided, the most likely answer is **memory leakage**.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Correct answer is (A).\nExplanation:\nBuffer overflow is caused when a program tries to store data into a buffer (storage area) that is too small to hold all of the data. This can happen when the programmer does not do proper bounds checking on input data.\nReason:\nIn C and C++, there are no built-in functions to perform bounds checking on data that is being copied into an array or buffer. This means that it is the responsibility of the programmer to ensure that the input data does not overflow the boundaries of the buffer.\n\nOne common way that buffer overflows occur is when a program receives input from the user or from a network connection and copies that input data into a fixed-size buffer without first checking if the input is larger than the buffer size. If the input data is larger than the buffer size, then it will write outside of the bounds of the buffer and potentially overwrite other memory locations, causing unpredictable behavior or security vulnerabilities in the program.\n\nOther possible reasons are (B) No storage check in the external memory, (C) No processing power check, (D) No database check but these are not the correct reasons for buffer overflow vulnerability in C and C++.",

A man-in-the-middle attack (MitM) can occur if an attacker intercepts the messages between the two parties, and secretly sends his own messages to each party. By doing so, the attacker can trick both parties into thinking they are communicating directly with each other, when in fact they are communicating with the attacker.\n\nIf the two parties are not joined, that means they are not yet aware that they are engaged in a communication session. In this case, the attacker can impersonate one of the parties and establish a separate communication session with the other party.
