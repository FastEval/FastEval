First, we make sure that the divisor (second number) is not zero, or we will not be able to perform the division. In this case, the divisor is -8, so we check if it is zero. Since it is not, we can proceed.\n\n2. If the divisor is negative, we need to make it positive by multiplying with -1. In this case, we have to multiply -8 with -1 to get 8.\n\n3. Now we can simply divide the first number (-40) by the positive divisor (8). The result is -5.\n\n4. In the final step, we need to check if the result is negative, and if yes, we have to multiply it with -1.
