            "model_answer": "Here's how you can approach this problem:\n\nA cannula is a small, flexible tube that is used to deliver fluids or medications into the body. The gauge of a cannula refers to its thickness, with lower gauge numbers indicating a thicker cannula.\n\nIn a patient who needs a rapid blood transfusion, a thinner cannula would be preferred to allow for a faster flow of blood. However, it is important to note that using a cannula that is too thin can increase the risk of complications such as clotting.\n\nBased on the information provided, 24 gauge would be the correct answer, as it is the thinnest option and would allow for the fastest flow of blood.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first define what each of the attributes (A) to (D) refer to:\n- Strength: The ability to exert force against a resistance.\n- Power: The ability to exert force quickly.\n- Stride length: The distance covered with each step.\n- Stamina: The ability to sustain physical activity for an extended period.\n\nNow, let's consider what is required to be a successful marathon runner. Marathon runners need to cover a long distance (typically 42.2 km) in a relatively short period of time. Therefore, they need to have a high level of stamina to be able to sustain the physical activity for an extended period.\n\nMoreover, marathon runners need to maintain a consistent pace throughout the race, and they may need to accelerate at certain points, such as when passing other runners or when approaching the finish line. In these situations, they need to have a good level of power to be able to increase their speed quickly.\n\nHowever, the key attribute in successful marathon running is stamina. While strength and power are important, they are less critical than stamina. And while stride length can be important for some runners, it is not the key attribute for marathon running.",

According to the Alzheimer's Society, Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, while HIV/AIDS is not listed among the top ten causes.\n\nNext, we can eliminate (C) Lewy body dementia. While this is a common form of dementia, Alzheimer's disease is still more prevalent.\n\nThis leaves us with (A) Alzheimer's disease and (B) Cerebrovascular (stroke) disease as the two most likely causes of dementia in the UK. According to the Alzheimer's Society, Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases, while stroke is the second most common cause, accounting for around 20% of cases.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the distinction between Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease can be difficult to make, as the two often coexist. Therefore, it is possible that cerebrovascular disease is the true answer to the question, depending on how the data is interpreted.\n\nBased on the available information, the answer to the question is likely (A) Alzheimer's disease or (B) Cerebrovascular (stroke) disease, with Alzheimer's disease being the most common cause of dementia in the UK.",

Instead, it is affected by lactic acid production, which can build up during anaerobic metabolism and contribute to muscle fatigue.\n\n(C) Blood glucose concentration does not directly affect the relative contribution of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism either. Instead, it is a primary source of fuel for the body during exercise, regardless of the metabolic pathway.\n\n(D) During short, intense bursts of exercise like sprints, anaerobic metabolism predominates because it can provide energy quickly without the need for oxygen. However, as the duration of the exercise increases, the body relies more on aerobic metabolism, which can provide energy at a slower but more sustainable rate. So, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases over time.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the four statements is true in diplopia, we can break down each statement and analyze the information provided.\n\nDiplopia, also known as double vision, occurs when there is a problem with the alignment of the eyes or with the nerves that control eye movement. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, including a fourth or sixth nerve palsy.\n\n**Statement 1:** \"Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered\"\n\n**Statement 2:** \"The outer image is always the false image\"\n\n**Statement 3:** \"A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards\"\n\n**Statement 4:** \"A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint\"\n\n> Note: A divergent squint or strabismus is when one eye turns outward while the other stays straight ahead.\n\nLet's begin by evaluating statement 1:\n\n> Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered\nThis statement is false. While covering one eye may reduce double vision in some cases, it does not eliminate it entirely. Double vision can still occur if there are problems with eye alignment or with the nerves that control eye movement, even if one eye is covered.\n\nNext, let's evaluate statement 2:\n\n> The outer image is always the false image\nThis statement is not entirely correct. While the outer image may appear false in some cases of double vision, it is not always the case. The false image can appear anywhere in the field of vision, depending on the underlying cause of the double vision.\n\nMoving on to statement 3:\n\n> A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards\nThis statement is true. A fourth nerve palsy, also known as a superior oblique palsy, occurs when there is damage to the fourth cranial nerve, which controls the movement of the eye in upward and downward directions. As a result, patients with a fourth nerve palsy may experience double vision when looking upwards.\n\nFinally, let's evaluate statement 4:\n\n> A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint\nThis statement is also true. A sixth nerve palsy, also known as a lateral rectus palsy, can cause the eye to turn outward, resulting in a divergent squint. Double vision may also occur in some cases of sixth nerve palsy.\n\nIn conclusion, statements 3 and 4 are true, while statements 1 and 2 are not entirely accurate.",

Carnitine is an amino acid derivative that serves as the carrier protein for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria.\n\nFirst of all, let\u2019s see what the other answer choices are not correct.\n\n\u2022 Thiokinase is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA).\n\n\u2022 CoA is a coenzyme that is involved in a wide variety of metabolic processes, including the oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria.
