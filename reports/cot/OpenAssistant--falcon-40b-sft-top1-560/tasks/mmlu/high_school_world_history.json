By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . .

From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

            "model_answer": "(D) The people in his court wore silk robes.\n\nExplanation: The passage mentions that the people in the king's court wore robes made of cotton, silk, or brocade, which suggests that silk was a valuable and accessible material in Ghana. Silk was produced in large quantities in China and exported to various parts of Asia and Europe, and it is likely that Ghana was one of the trading partners of Asia that imported silk through intermediaries. The fact that silk was available in the king's court suggests that Ghana was engaged in some form of trade with Asia to acquire this luxurious fabric.",

This novel depicts the tumultuous events of the French Revolution and portrays the revolutionaries as motivated by hope and idealism. Dickens emphasizes the potential for positive change in the face of adversity.\n\nIn contrast, the adjectives in answer choice B, understanding and accepting, describe the tone of William Wordsworth's work, The Prelude. Wordsworth's poem offers a retrospective view of the French Revolution and highlights the ways in which the ideals of the revolution were compromised by violence and political instability. While Wordsworth acknowledges the complexities of the period, he does not dismiss the revolutionary spirit entirely.\n\nAnswer choice C, cynical and enthusiastic, does not accurately describe either work.

In order to maintain the labor required to cultivate crops such as sugar cane, rice, and tobacco, they relied heavily on the importation of enslaved Africans. The demand for enslaved Africans was so great that by the 18th century, an estimated 12 million Africans had been forcibly transported across the Atlantic and sold into slavery.\n\nThis had a devastating impact on Sub-Saharan African societies, as entire communities were torn apart as people were captured, sold, and transported across the ocean.

Hitler, who became the leader of Germany in the 1930s, believed that the treaty was an affront to German pride and sovereignty and sought to revise its terms through peaceful means.

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.
