Commutativity: For any two elements a and b in the set, a + b = b + a.\n\n3. Associativity: For any three elements a, b, and c in the set, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).\n\n4. Identity element: There exists an element e in the set such that for any element a in the set, a + e = a.\n\nAn additive abelian group is called torsion-free if no element of the group is a multiple of another element.\n\nNow, let's consider the property that x + x + x + x = 0 for each x in G. This means that for any four distinct elements a, b, c, and d in G, we have:\n```\n a + b + c + d = 0\n```\nIf we take a, b, c, and d to be any four distinct elements of G, then we can rearrange the terms to get:\n```\n 2(a + b) = -d\n```\nSince G is an abelian group, we can subtract c from both sides:\n```\n 2(a + b) - c = -d + c\n```\nLet's simplify the left-hand side by using the distributive property:\n```\n 2a + 2b = d + c\n```\nNext, we can subtract b from both sides:\n```\n 2a = d + c - b\n```\nAt this point, we have shown that for any four distinct elements a, b, c, and d in G, we have:\n```\n 2a = d + c - b\n```\nand\n```\n 2b = d - c + a\n```\nSince G is torsion-free, we can divide both sides of the above equations by 2 to get:\n```\n a = d + c - b\n b = d - c + a\n```\nTherefore, if we let x = a, y = b, z = c, and t = d, then we have proven the following:\n```\n x + y + z + t = 0\n```\nfor all choices of four distinct elements a, b, c, and d in G.\n\nHowever, since G is an abelian group of order 16, we know that there are only 15 possible choices for any four distinct elements a, b, c, and d in G (since we can't choose all four elements to be the same). Therefore, we have proven that there are only 15 additive abelian groups of order 16 that satisfy the property that x + x + x + x = 0 for each x in G.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **C**.",

The bottom end of the ladder is pulled away from the wall at a rate of 2 meters per second:\n\nAs the bottom end of the ladder is pulled away from the wall, the top end will still be in equilibrium (at rest), so the only force acting on it will still be gravity.\n\nHowever, since the bottom end is moving, we need to apply the kinematic equation to find its position as a function of time:\n\nx_b = x_0 + v_0*t + (1/2)*a*t^2\n\nwhere x_b is the position of the bottom end of the ladder, x_0 is its initial position (0), v_0 is its initial velocity (0), t is time, and a is the acceleration (9.81 m/s^2).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nx_b = 0 + 0*t + (1/2)*9.81*t^2\nx_b = (1/2)*9.81*t^2\n\nso the bottom end of the ladder will have moved 3.5 meters (sqrt(9.81*3^2)) from its initial position after 1 second.\n\n# 3.

Find the velocity of the top end of the ladder when it's 3 meters above the ground:\n\nTo find the velocity of the top end of the ladder when it's 3 meters above the ground, we need to solve the equation v_t = -9.81*t for t:\n\n9.81*t = 3\nt = 3/9.81 = 0.308 seconds\n\n# 5.
