The treaty resolved a long-standing dispute between the two nations over the Oregon Territory, which both countries claimed.\n\nPrior to the treaty, both the United States and Great Britain had established settlements in the region, and tensions had risen over who had the legitimate claim to the territory. The treaty ultimately ended the dispute and allowed for peaceful resolution of the boundary issue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Great Britain ceded it to the United States as part of a negotiated treaty.",

Board of Education, 1954**\n\nDesegregation of schools was, in part, a response to unfulfilled promises from Reconstruction.\n\nReform policies after the Civil War, known as Reconstruction, aimed to ensure equal rights and protection under the law for newly freed slaves. These policies included the Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed equal protection under the law, and the Freedmen's Bureau, which provided education and other services to former slaves.\n\nHowever, as the Reconstruction era came to an end, many of these promises were not fulfilled. States passed Jim Crow laws, which enforced segregation and institutionalized discrimination against African Americans. These laws prevented desegregation of schools and limited the opportunities available to African American students.\n\nBrown v. Board of Education, the landmark Supreme Court case that declared segregation in public schools unconstitutional, was a direct response to the unfulfilled promises of Reconstruction. The Court ruled that segregated schools were inherently unequal and violated the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law.\n\nThe Brown decision was a major step forward in the fight for civil rights and helped to pave the way for desegregation of schools and other institutions. However, the road to desegregation was a long and difficult one, and it took many years of protests, legal battles, and social activism to fully achieve the goal of equal access to education for all Americans.",

The Emancipation Proclamation altered the course of the Civil War by signaling the end of the federal government's neutrality on the issue of slavery and setting the stage for the eventual abolition of slavery in the United States. While it did not immediately free all enslaved individuals in the Confederate States, it did declare that all slaves in rebel territories were thenceforth free. This meant that any slaves who escaped to Union lines or were captured by Union forces were no longer subject to being returned to their owners. This change in policy created a significant shift in the dynamics of the war, as it effectively transformed the conflict from a war to preserve the Union into a war for the abolition of slavery. This in turn made it more difficult for Great Britain and other foreign powers to justify any involvement on behalf of the Confederacy, which helped to isolate the Confederacy diplomatically. Additionally, the Emancipation Proclamation served as a powerful rallying cry for abolitionists and other supporters of the Union cause, reinvigorating the war effort and helping to ensure that the war did not end in a compromise that would have allowed for the continued existence of slavery. Ultimately, the Emancipation Proclamation played a critical role in securing the eventual victory of the Union and the eventual abolition of slavery throughout the United States.",
