            "model_answer": "An auditor generally performs the following procedures regarding subsequent events:\n\n\"Subsequent Events (Definition and Measurement). The auditor shall inquire of those charged with governance and management whether any events have occurred between the date of the financial statements and the date of the auditor's report that could require the recognition, derecognition, or disclosure of an account or a disclosure in the financial statements. This inquiry should extend to events related to conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period but that did not result in recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. (AU-C 855.02) The purpose of the inquiry is to determine whether events have occurred or conditions exist that may require modification to the financial statements on the basis of subsequent events. Subsequent events include those that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the financial statements and those that arise after the date of the financial statements. (AU-C 855.03)\nThe auditor shall determine whether events or transactions have occurred, or conditions have changed, between the date of the financial statements and the date of the auditor's report, that may require recognition, derecognition, disclosure, or modification to the financial statements. Recognition refers to the initial recording of an item or event in the financial statements. Derecognition refers to the removal of an item or event from the financial statements. Disclosure refers to the communication of information in the notes or elsewhere in the financial statements. Modification refers to the changing of the amounts, classifications, or presentation of items already included in the financial statements. When performing this procedure, the auditor shall obtain sufficient appropriate evidence about the nature and timing of events or transactions that have occurred and conditions that have changed after the date of the financial statements.\nThe auditor shall evaluate the potential effect of each subsequent event or transaction that requires recognition or disclosure or that may require modification to the financial statements. The auditor shall also determine whether the effects of each such event or transaction are material to the financial statements taken as a whole. If the effects of the event or transaction are determined to be material, then the auditor shall adjust the financial statements accordingly. (AU-C 855.04) If the auditor determines that it is probable that a subsequent event or transaction will occur after the date of the financial statements but before the date of the auditor's report and that it will be recognized in the financial statements, then the auditor shall recognize the effect of that event or transaction in the financial statements. The auditor shall disclose the nature of that event or transaction and its potential effect, if any, in the auditor's report.\nThe auditor shall obtain an understanding of the events or transactions that occur between the date of the financial statements and the date of the auditor's report, and of those that are likely to occur prior to the date of the auditor's report. The auditor shall obtain an understanding of the events or transactions that are reasonably possible, not remote, that will occur after the date of the financial statements. Examples of reasonably possible subsequent events that may occur after the date of the financial statements include contract settlements or terminations, pending litigation, product liability claims, and the outcome of votes on proposals to be made to security holders after the date of the financial statements. (AU-C 855.05) \"\n\nTherefore, option (D) - Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited - is not a procedure an auditor would generally perform regarding subsequent events.",

This will also be discounted at the appropriate rate:\n$$CF_{10} = 500 \\times (1 + r)^10$$\nNow that we have all our cash flows, we can add them together to get our NPV:\n$$NPV = CF_1 + CF_5 + CF_{10}$$\nSubstituting in our values:\n$$NPV = -500 \\times (1 + r)^1 + 500 \\times (1 + r)^5 + 500 \\times (1 + r)^10$$\nSimplifying:\n$$NPV = -500(1 + r)^1 + 500(1 + r)^5 + 500(1 + r)^10$$\nWe now need to calculate the values of (1 + r)^1, (1 + r)^5, and (1 + r)^10.

During each accounting period, Dean Co. should have accrued interest expense on the bonds payable using the effective interest method, and increased the carrying amount of the bonds payable by the accrued interest expense. At the same time, Dean Co. should have accrued a liability under \"Retained Earnings - Unearned Bond Discount\" to reflect the unamortized bond discount. Dean Co. should have reported the bond discount as a deferred bond premium on its balance sheet.\n\nGiven the above, for option (A):\n\n- Since Dean Co. incorrectly used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method, the amortization expense recorded each accounting period would be overstated, resulting in the carrying amount of the bonds payable being overstated. The retained earnings - unearned bond discount liability would also be overstated. Since Dean Co. also mistakenly recorded bond discount as bond premium, the reported amount under \"Retained Earnings - Unearned Bond Discount\" would be overstated. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.\n\nFor option (B):\n\n- Since the carrying amount of the bonds payable and the unearned bond discount liability would be overstated, the net effect would be that the bond issue would be under-reported on Dean Co.'s balance sheet, resulting in option (B) being incorrect.\n\nFor option (C):\n\n- Since both the carrying amount of the bonds payable and the unearned bond discount liability would be overstated, the net effect would be that the bond issue would be over-reported on Dean Co.'s balance sheet, resulting in option (C) being incorrect.\n\nTherefore, for option (D):\n\n- Since both the carrying amount of the bonds payable and the unearned bond discount liability would be overstated, the net effect would be that the bond issue would be over-reported on Dean Co.'s balance sheet, resulting in option (D) being incorrect.\n\nThe correct option is therefore (A), where the carrying amount of the bonds payable and the unearned bond discount liability would be overstated, resulting in the bond issue being over-reported on Dean Co.'s balance sheet.",
