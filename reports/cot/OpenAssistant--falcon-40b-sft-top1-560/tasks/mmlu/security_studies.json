            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Let's break down each of the potential answers and see if we can identify which one does not belong.\n\n- The responsibility to prevent refers to the idea that states have a responsibility to take action to prevent mass atrocities from occurring.\n- The responsibility to react refers to the idea that states have a responsibility to respond when mass atrocities occur or are imminent.\n- The responsibility to remain sovereign refers to the idea that states have a right to maintain their sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n- The responsibility to rebuild refers to the idea that states have a responsibility to help rebuild societies that have been affected by mass atrocities.\n\nBased on these definitions, it seems that answer (C) - the responsibility to remain sovereign - is the answer that does not belong. While it is important for states to maintain their sovereignty, it is not an element of the responsibility to protect. The responsibility to protect focuses on preventing and responding to mass atrocities, rather than on maintaining sovereignty.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) - the responsibility to remain sovereign.",

            "question": "Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\n\n(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",

However, they can also create opportunities for diversification and research, which could lead to technological advancements that benefit military programs.\n\n2. While environmental changes can undermine national security by weakening the economic base of a country, they can also lead to positive developments that bolster military programs. The impact of environmental changes on national security will depend on a variety of factors, including the country's ability to adapt and innovate.\n\n3. While environmental problems can pose a threat to a country's stability and economic growth, external military threats remain a primary concern for national security. However, environmental problems can exacerbate existing tensions and contribute to instability in certain regions.\n\n4. The correct answer is (D) - all of these options. Environmental changes can have both positive and negative impacts on national security, and the relationship between the two is complex and dynamic.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

However, it has been criticized for several reasons, including that it:\n\n* is neo-colonial: Some argue that human security is a neo-colonial concept that seeks to impose Western values and interests on other cultures. It is seen as a way for Western powers to justify interventions in other countries under the pretext of protecting human rights.\n* promotes global capitalism: Human security has been criticized for promoting global capitalism by emphasizing economic development and free trade. Critics argue that this ignores the root causes of insecurity, such as economic inequality and environmental degradation.\n* is too broad: Human security is a broad concept that encompasses a wide range of issues, such as health, education, and environmental protection. Some argue that this makes it difficult to prioritize and address specific threats to human security effectively.\n\nTherefore, all of the listed options are common criticisms of the human security concept.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated.\n(D) Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated.

            "model_answer": "The potential problem for policy in the institutionalization of academe-policy interaction that emerged is (C), where Security Studies became one of International Relations' two pillars, the second being International Political Economy.\nExplanation:\n\nThe institutionalization of academe-policy interaction has led to an increased dependence on think tanks and an overall expansion of the role of academics in policy making.\n\nHowever, this has also resulted in a shift in the focus of security studies away from its traditional disciplinary context in political science towards multi-academic interaction from sociology, mathematics, psychology, natural and political sciences, and economics.\n\nThis has caused a gradual \"IR-ification\" of the discipline, where Security Studies became one of the two pillars of International Relations (IR), alongside International Political Economy (IPE).\n\nAs a result, security studies has become increasingly interwoven with IR, and has lost some of its distinctiveness as a field of inquiry. This has created a potential problem for policy in the institutionalization of academe-policy interaction, as it has narrowed the range of perspectives that are considered in policy making.\n\nTherefore, (C) is the correct answer.",
