This ensures stability and prevents the oscillator from running away.\n\nFor phase, we want it to be either 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0, which means that the feedback signal is in phase with the input signal. This ensures that the feedback signal adds constructively to the input signal, further reinforcing the oscillation.\n\nBoth of these conditions must be satisfied for the oscillator to meet the Barkhausen criterion.",

A potentiometer is a resistor with a sliding contact that allows the resistance to be varied. It is used in the potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement to reduce the effect of the measuring instrument on the circuit being measured.\n\nIn this method, the unknown voltage is compared to a known voltage using a potentiometer. The potentiometer is adjusted until the two voltages are equal, and the resistance value of the potentiometer is then used to calculate the unknown voltage.\n\nHere are the steps to answer the question:\n\n1. We know that potentiometers are used to reduce the effect of the measuring instrument on the circuit being measured. This is because they have a high resistance and do not load the circuit to a significant extent.\n2. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and B, which state that potentiometers load the circuit moderately and to the maximum extent, respectively.\n3. Option C also does not make sense, as a galvanometer is not used in the potentiometer method.\n4. This leaves us with option D, which states that potentiometers do not load the circuit at all.

For this, we can use the trigonometric identity:\nsin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1\n\nWe can write the applied voltage as:\nV = Vm * cos(theta)\n\nThen, we can simplify and solve for theta:\nV = Vm * cos(theta)\nV <= sqrt((200)^2 + R^2)\nVm * cos(theta) <= sqrt((200)^2 + R^2)\ncos(theta) <= (Vm / sqrt((200)^2 + R^2))\n\nWe can rewrite the above equation in terms of theta:\ntheta <= arccos((Vm / sqrt((200)^2 + R^2))\n\nNow, we need to solve for the range of theta in degrees.
