            "model_answer": "Sure, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Given: A valid disjunctive syllogism has a major premise that:\n    - includes two or more alternatives\n    - classifies subjects\n    - affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent\n    - leads to a valid conclusion\n\n2. From the given statements, we can conclude that the major premise must include two or more alternatives. This means that the major premise must take the form of:\n\n    A or B or C or ...\n\n3. We can now fill in the minor premises and conclusion based on the given major premise. Here's an example:\n\n    Major premise: A or B or C or D\n    Minor premise 1: A\n    Minor premise 2: B\n    Conclusion: Therefore, C or D\n\n4. Based on the given statements, the major premise must lead to a valid conclusion. The major premise must be disjunctive (i.e., it must include two or more alternatives), and the conclusion must be a disjunction of the minor premises. Therefore, if the given statements are true, then the disjunctive syllogism is valid.\n\n5. Output: (D) leads to a valid conclusion.",

The _ad nauseam_ fallacy, also known as argumentum ad nauseam, is a type of argument that suggests that something should be done or accepted because it has been done or accepted so many times before, even if there is no good reason for doing so. It is a fallacy because repeating something over and over again does not make it true.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\n(A) is not the _ad nauseam_ fallacy.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) division.\n\nArgument by division, also known as petitio principii or begging the question, occurs when the conclusion of an argument is included in its premises. This fallacy assumes that the truth of the conclusion is already established and uses this assumption to support the conclusion, resulting in a circular argument.\n\nFor example: \"We should legalize marijuana because it is a natural product that has been used for centuries. It is a harmless drug that has many medical benefits and has never killed anyone. Therefore, it should be legalized.\"\n\nIn this argument, the conclusion that marijuana should be legalized is already included in the premises. The argument assumes that marijuana is harmless and has medical benefits, which are the very reasons it should be legalized in the first place. This is a circular argument that does not provide any real support for the conclusion.\n\nA hasty generalization (option (B)) is a fallacy that occurs when a conclusion is drawn based on insufficient evidence or a biased sample. It involves making a sweeping conclusion about a group based on very limited information or experience. For example, \"All teenagers are irresponsible and unreliable. I had a bad experience with one teenager, so I know they're all the same.\"\n\nFalse criteria (option (A)) is a fallacy that occurs when the criteria used to evaluate something are inaccurate or incomplete. It involves using standards that are not appropriate or relevant to the situation at hand. For example, \"This restaurant is terrible because they don't have any vegetarian options. All good restaurants should have vegetarian options.\"\n\nAd crumenam (option (C)) is a fallacy that occurs when an argument is based solely on the authority or expertise of the person making the argument, rather than on evidence or logic. For example, \"You should believe me because I'm a doctor.\" Just because someone is an expert in one field does not necessarily mean they are an expert in all fields.",

This type of fallacy is often employed when an arguer is unable or unwilling to provide a valid counterargument against their opponent's position. By instead trying to make the opponent or their argument appear ridiculous or absurd, the arguer hopes to persuade others to dismiss the argument without considering its merits.

Specifically, the fallacy assumes that someone is guilty or shares the same beliefs as the people they associate with.\n\nIn this case, the person is concluding that someone must be honest because the people he hangs around with are honest. However, this conclusion is fallacious because a person's honesty is not determined by the people they choose to spend time with. Each individual is responsible for their own actions and beliefs, and should not be judged based on the actions or beliefs of others.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B), Guilt by association.",
