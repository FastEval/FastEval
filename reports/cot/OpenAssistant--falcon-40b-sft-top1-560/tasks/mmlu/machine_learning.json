            "model_answer": "Here is the step-by-step explanation for the question:\n\nStatement 1: Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\n\nExplanation:\nLinear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a scalar dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes that the dependent variable can be linearly predicted from the independent variables. The linear regression estimator is unbiased which means that it has a mean equal to the true value of the population parameter being estimated. The variance of the linear regression estimator is smaller than that of any other unbiased estimator. Therefore, statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\n\nExplanation:\nAdaBoost is a machine learning algorithm used for building strong classifiers from weak ones. It works by successively adding copies of a weak classifier to the ensemble until the errors are reduced. The algorithm assigns weights \u03b1 to each classifier in the ensemble, with \u03b1 being proportional to the inverse of the error rate of the base classifier. These weights tend to be small for easier samples and larger for harder ones. The coefficients \u03b1 can take positive or negative values but they are usually constrained to be non-negative in practice. Hence, statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) True, False",

However, the support vectors, which are the examples that fall closest to the hyperplane and have the most influence on the model's decision, should remain relatively unchanged as we move from a linear kernel to a higher-order polynomial kernel.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that Statement 1 is true, while Statement 2 is also true.

For example, for the first attribute with 3 possible values, the total number of combinations is 3^1 = 3. Similarly, for the second attribute with 2 possible values, the total number of combinations is 2^2 = 4. For the third attribute with 2 possible values, the total number of combinations is 2^3 = 8. And for the fourth attribute with 2 possible values, the total number of combinations is 2^4 = 16.\n\nFor the class attribute, the total number of combinations is simply the number of possible values for that attribute. Since there are 3 possible values for the class attribute, the total number of combinations for the class attribute is 3^1 = 3.\n\nNow, to find the total number of possible combinations, we simply need to multiply all of these numbers together. So, the total number of possible combinations for all 5 attributes is:\n\n(3^1)(2^2)(2^3)(2^4)(3^1) = 3 * 4 * 8 * 16 * 3 = 864\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 864 possible different examples in this machine learning problem.\n\nThe correct answer is (C).",

Expectation maximization (EM) aims to find the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a statistical model based on incomplete observations.\n2. In each iteration of EM, the expectation step involves calculating the expected values of the missing data given the current parameter estimates, and the maximization step involves updating the parameter estimates based on the observed data and the expected values.\n3. If the parameter estimates are initialized randomly, the log-likelihood of the data may increase, decrease or remain the same in each iteration of EM, depending on the initial values and the choice of update rules.\n4. Therefore, it is not true that the log-likelihood of the data will always increase through successive iterations of EM.\n\nStatement 2 is:\n\n\"One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment.\"\n\n\nLet's analyze this statement and see if it is True or False:\n\n1.

In addition, Q-learning assumes that the learner has perfect knowledge about the transition probabilities and rewards, which may not be the case in real-world situations.\n4.
