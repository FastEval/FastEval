            "model_answer": "To answer this question we'll need to first determine the properties of each of these types of bonding, and then rule out each of them based on the given information.\n\nIonic bonding: Ionic compounds have high melting points, are generally poor conductors of electricity, and do not dissolve in water. However, they are typically soluble in polar solvents such as water-based solutions. Since this substance is not soluble in water, it is unlikely to be an ionic compound.\n\nNonpolar covalent bonding: Nonpolar covalent compounds also have high melting points and are poor conductors of electricity. However, they are typically soluble in nonpolar solvents such as oils and fats. If the unknown substance were a nonpolar covalent compound, it would likely be soluble in nonpolar solvents like oils and fats. Since this is not the case, we can rule out nonpolar covalent bonding.\n\nCovalent network bonding: Covalent network solids (such as graphite and diamond) have high melting points and are poor conductors of electricity. However, they are not typically soluble in any solvents. Since the unknown substance is not soluble in any solvents, covalent network bonding is a possible option.\n\nMetallic bonding: Metals have high melting points and are good conductors of electricity. However, they are typically soluble in strong acids and bases. Since the unknown substance is not soluble in any solvents, metallic bonding is not a likely option.\n\nBased on the information given, we can deduce that the most likely type of bonding in the unknown substance is covalent network bonding. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) nonpolar covalent bonding.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to use our understanding of chemical reactions and net ionic equations to determine the balanced chemical equation and then convert it into a net ionic equation.\n\nFirst, let's balance the chemical equation that represents the reaction between solutions of NH4Br and AgNO3:\n\nNH4Br(aq) + AgNO3(aq) -> ???\n\nTo balance this equation, we need to identify the reactants and products and determine the correct coefficient for each substance to make the number of atoms of each element equal on both sides of the equation. We can see that there are one molecule of NH4Br and one molecule of AgNO3 on the left side of the equation, so we need to add a coefficient of 1 to each substance to make the number of atoms equal. We also need to use the correct chemical formulas to represent the substances.\n\n???? = NH4Br(aq) + AgNO3(aq) -> AgBr(s)\n\nNext, we need to write the net ionic equation for this reaction. To do this, we need to identify the ionic compounds that are formed in the reaction and their corresponding ions. In this reaction, we have the formation of the ionic compound AgBr, which is a precipitate. So, we need to include this ionic compound in the net ionic equation. We also need to consider the ions that are present in the solution before the reaction occurs, which are NH4+, Br-, Ag+, and NO3-.\n\nThe net ionic equation for this reaction is:\n\n[NH4+][Br-] + [Ag+][NO3-] -> [AgBr]\n\nSince the [AgBr] term is a solid, it does not contain any ions and can be ignored in the net ionic equation. Therefore, the final net ionic equation for this reaction is:\n\n[NH4+][Br-] -> [AgBr]\n\nThe answer is (D).",
