            "model_answer": "The passage suggests that Huxley argued that \"life\" was (C) merely a property of a certain kind of matter.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of my reasoning:\n1. According to the passage, Huxley proposed to translate the term \"Protoplasm\" as \"the physical basis of life.\" This suggests that he believed that \"life\" was a physical phenomenon that could be studied and understood scientifically.\n2. The passage goes on to say that Huxley believed that \"life\" was not a force or a supernatural phenomenon, but a property of a certain kind of matter. This is supported by the fact that he says that \"the matter of life\" breaks down into ordinary matter, such as carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, after death.\n3. Huxley acknowledges that the idea that life is the result of a physical process may be novel to some people, but he asserts that this is what we know based on scientific evidence. His goal in the discourse is to explain this concept to his audience.\n4. Therefore, based on the above analysis, we can infer that Huxley believed that \"life\" was a property of physical matter and not a supernatural or philosophical phenomenon.",

            "model_answer": "I'm going to answer this question by first breaking down the quote into its core parts:\n\n- The Roman world had multiple modes of worship.\n- People saw worship as either true or false.\n- People saw worship as either useful or useless to the state.\n- Emperors saw worship as useful to the state.\n\nFirstly, since the Romans were a polytheistic society, it makes sense for there to be multiple modes of worship. Roman religion was particularly diverse, often borrowing and adapting elements from conquered civilizations to form a unique polytheistic religious system.\n\nSecondly, the idea that worship was either seen as true or false seems to align with the concept of religion itself. In general, people either believe in a religion's teachings or they do not.\n\nThirdly, the idea that worship was seen as either useful or useless to the state is not entirely surprising, given the role that religion played in society. In ancient Rome, the state was heavily involved in religious practices and used them to maintain social order, promote public welfare, and legitimize political authority.\n\nFinally, the idea that emperors saw worship as useful for the state is supported by the fact that they often supported and promoted state-sponsored religions to maintain stability and control.\n\nBased on this analysis, Gibbon's statement seems to be saying that religion in ancient Rome was seen as a useful tool by the state, regardless of whether it was seen as true or false by individuals. This interpretation aligns with A, which states that religious worship in ancient Rome was decentralized and tended to vary with one's social position.",

If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him.

            "model_answer": "The nineteenth-century Russian historian would likely be most interested in the sense of continual class struggle described in the passage. The passage is taken from the novel Germinal by French writer \u00c9mile Zola, which depicts the lives of coal miners in late nineteenth-century France, and it highlights the ongoing tensions and struggles between the working class and the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe passage portrays the character Souvarine, a Russian revolutionary who has become disillusioned with the Nihilist movement in his home country and has turned his attention towards the French working class in the hope of seeing the foundation of a new society based on labour and equality. However, he is frustrated to find that the miners he has come to know are more interested in winning the lottery and securing their own financial gain than in working towards a collective, revolutionary goal.\n\nThis sense of continual class struggle is a recurring theme throughout the novel, which portrays the difficult and often dangerous working conditions of the miners, as well as their exploitation by the mining company. The miners' desire for better working conditions and fair treatment is at the heart of the novel's narrative, and it is in this context that the Russian historian would likely find the most value in studying the passage.\n\nWhile the novel does touch on other themes, such as the Russian influence on French culture and the camaraderie amongst the miners, the main focus is on the ongoing struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the historian would likely see the passage as a valuable window into the social and political issues of the time, and the spirit of class struggle that permeated the lives of the miners and other working-class people.",

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\n(A) De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n(C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n(D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.",

            "model_answer": "By examining both extracts, it is clear that there are significant differences in the interactions between the Spaniards and the native people, as described by Columbus and de las Casas.\n\nOne possible explanation for these differences is that de las Casas was exaggerating his account to support the start of African slavery in the Americas. De las Casas was a Catholic priest who was known for his advocacy against the mistreatment of the indigenous people in the Americas. He was a strong opponent of the use of forced labor and advocated for the use of African slaves instead. Therefore, it is possible that he exaggerated the brutality of the Spaniards towards the natives in order to justify the introduction of African slavery.\n\nOn the other hand, Columbus may have been biased in favor of himself and his men in his writings. Columbus was an explorer who led the first European expedition to the Americas. He was seeking wealth and fame, and was therefore likely to portray his interactions with the natives in a positive light. He may have downplayed any instances of violence or exploitation, and instead emphasized the peaceful and mutually beneficial nature of his relationships with the natives.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that the interactions between the Spaniards and the natives may have changed over time. Columbus's expedition was one of the earlier expeditions to the Americas, and it is possible that his men were nicer to the natives than later expeditions. Later expeditions may have been more violent and exploitative, and de las Casas may have been describing the interactions during a later period.\n\nFinally, it is also possible that de las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas. De las Casas was a proponent of the rights of the indigenous people, and he may have been using his account to highlight the brutality of the Spanish colonization in order to encourage the Spanish to leave the Americas and allow the natives to live in peace.",
