            "model_answer": "To find the degree of the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, we need to find the number of elements in the extension field.\n\nFirstly, let's find the minimal polynomial for each of the elements in the extension field.\n\nThe minimal polynomial for sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2.\nThe minimal polynomial for sqrt(3) over Q is x^2 + 3x + 1.\nThe minimal polynomial for sqrt(18) over Q is (x - 6)(x^2 + 6x + 18).\n\nNow, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the minimal polynomials.\n\nThe gcd of x^2 - 2, x^2 + 3x + 1, and (x - 6)(x^2 + 6x + 18) is (x - 6).\n\nSo, the extension field has (Q(sqrt(2)) x Q(sqrt(3)) x Q(sqrt(18))) / (x - 6) elements.\n\nSince the field extension has finite number of elements, it has finite degree. Therefore, we can use the formula n = [f(x) : f(x)] where f(x) is the minimal polynomial for an element in the extension field and n is the degree of the extension field.\n\nLet's find the minimal polynomial for each of the elements in the extension field again:\n\nThe minimal polynomial for sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2.\nThe minimal polynomial for sqrt(3) over Q is x^2 + 3x + 1.\nThe minimal polynomial for sqrt(18) over Q is (x - 6)(x^2 + 6x + 18).\n\nNow, we can find the gcd of the minimal polynomials again using the Chinese Remainder Theorem:\n\nThe gcd of x^2 - 2, x^2 + 3x + 1, and (x - 6)(x^2 + 6x + 18) is (x - 6).\n\nSo, f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 18x - 36.\n\nAnd thus, n = [f(x) : f(x)] = [x^3 - 6x^2 + 18x - 36 : x^2 - 2] = x^2 - 2.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is 2.\n\nThe answer is (C) 2.",

Given a permutation $p$ in $S_n$, we can find the cycle structure of $p$ by looking at the left-to-right order of its elements. Specifically, if $p=a_1a_2 ... a_k$, then $p$ has a cycle $(a_1,a_2 ... ,a_k)$ and the **length** of this cycle is $k$.\n\nWith that said, we can see that $p$ has two cycles: $(2,1,5,4)$ and $(2,3)$. The lengths of these cycles are $4$ and $2$, respectively. Therefore, we can write $p$ as $(2,1,5,4)(2,3)$ or equivalently, as $(4)(2)$.\n\nNow, given any permutation $q$ in $S_5$, we can find its index in $S_5$ by computing its left-to-right product with the identity permutation $(1,2,3,4,5)$ (the identity permutation is the permutation that maps every element to itself). Specifically, $q$'s index in $S_5$ is equal to $\\text{lcm} ([q, (1,2,3,4,5)] : [q, (1,2,3,4,5)] = 1)$ where $[q, p]$ is the left-to-right product of $q$ and $p$, and $\\text{lcm}$ denotes the least common multiple of the denominators of the indices of the cycles in $[q, p]$.\n\nApplying this procedure to $p$, we get:\n\n$$[p, (1,2,3,4,5)] = (4)(2)(1,2,3,4,5) = (4)(2,3,4,5) = (2,4,5)(3)$$\n\nThe indices of the cycles in $[p, (1,2,3,4,5)]$ are $4$, $2$, $5$, and $3$. The least common multiple of these indices is $120$. Therefore, the index of $p$ in $S_5$ is $120$.\n\nThe answer is **C**.) 120",

The factor group of a non-Abelian group inherits the non-Abelian property of the original group. In other words, if G is a non-Abelian group, then its factor group G/N, where N is any normal subgroup of G, will also be non-Abelian. This is because in a non-Abelian group, there exist elements that are not their own inverse, and this property is preserved in the factor group.\n\nStatement 2 is true. If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G. This is a basic property of group theory known as the first isomorphism theorem. It states that if H and K are normal subgroups of G and the homomorphism phi: H -> G/K is surjective (i.e., every element of G/K is mapped to by phi), then phi is bijective and the kernel of phi is K. This means that K is a normal subgroup of G/K, which is equivalent to saying that K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nBased on the truth values of the two statements, the correct answer is (C).
