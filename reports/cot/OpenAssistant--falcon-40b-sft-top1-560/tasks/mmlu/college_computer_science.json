Set (B) contains both negative and positive integers, so it is a possibility. Set (C) also contains both negative and positive integers, and it includes some of the common divisors of 8 and 12 (such as 2 and 4).

This node includes information about the owner of the file, the number of links to the tile, and the disk block numbers of the file. With this approach, multiple users can access the same file by sharing the directory entry that points to the node containing the file information.\n\nHowever, there is a primary drawback to this approach, which is:\n\nOption C: if the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.\n\nWhen the owner of a shared file deletes it, the directory entry that points to the node containing information about the file becomes a dangling link. This means that the link is no longer pointing to a valid node, and any user who tries to access the file through this link will encounter an error.\n\nTo avoid this problem, the file system must maintain some mechanism for detecting and removing dangling links. This can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, and it can lead to reduced performance and increased complexity in the file system. Additionally, if the file system does not detect and remove dangling links quickly enough, it can result in wasted disk space and confusion for users.\n\nTherefore, allowing the owner of a shared file to delete it without proper handling of dangling links can be a primary drawback to the approach of sharing tiles in a multilevel directory structure using directory entries that are links pointing to a node containing information about the shared file.",
