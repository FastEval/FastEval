            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Your patient's decreased sensation on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh could be caused by compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.\n\nThe lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) supplies sensory innervation to the skin of the lateral thigh. Compression of this nerve can result in decreased sensation in the distribution of the nerve.\n\nIn your patient's case, she had a hematoma on her left thigh that was resolving when she was discharged from the hospital 2 weeks ago. This hematoma could have compressed the LFCN, leading to the decreased sensation she is currently experiencing.\n\nOther potential causes that you mentioned, such as cerebral infarction during the hospitalization, complication of the IVC filter placement, or hematoma of the left thigh, are less likely to be the cause of her decreased sensation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of your patient's decreased sensation is compression of the LFCN by the hematoma on her left thigh.",

            "question": "A 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female is admitted to the hospital at 39\u00a0weeks' gestation in active labor. She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated. The most likely diagnosis is\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions\n(B) lower uterine retraction ring\n(C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction\n(D) primary dysfunctional labor",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "After reviewing the clinical scenario provided, I would suspect that the most likely diagnosis is (C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction. Here is my reasoning:\n\nThe patient is 39\u00a0weeks' gestation, in active labor, and has been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes. However, she is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions, and has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. This suggests that labor has slowed or stalled, and the lack of progress in dilation despite regular contractions is a concerning sign.\n\nExamination shows no reason for obstructed labor, so other causes of labor dystocia must be considered. Hypotonic uterine dysfunction, also known as uterine inertia, is a condition in which the uterus does not contract effectively during labor, despite the presence of regular contractions. This can result in inadequate cervical dilation and slow progress in labor.\n\nPrimary dysfunctional labor is a type of labor dystocia characterized by contractions that are either too weak or too frequent to cause effective cervical dilation. This can result in a prolonged labor and an increased risk of complications. While it is possible that this is the cause of the patient's slow progress in labor, the fact that she has had regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes and is now only having a few intermittent, weak contractions suggests that primary dysfunctional labor is less likely than hypotonic uterine dysfunction.\n\nBraxton Hicks contractions are irregular and typically not painful, so they are unlikely to be the cause of the patient's pain and decreased contractions. Lower uterine retraction ring is a complication of labor in which the cervix becomes fixed in a posterior position, preventing further dilation. This is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's slow progress in labor, as the cervix is 100% effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated.\n\nWhile it is possible that the patient's slow progress in labor could be due to other factors, hypotonic uterine dysfunction is the most likely diagnosis based on the information provided.",

This means that there is less than a 5% chance that the difference in means could have occurred by chance alone. However, from a clinical perspective, the difference in mean time for resolution of symptoms between the new drug and the placebo group (0.3 days) is relatively small and may not be meaningful to patients. Additionally, the confidence interval around the mean time for resolution of symptoms in the new drug group includes the mean time for resolution of symptoms in the placebo group, suggesting that the effect of the new drug on symptoms resolution may not be consistent across individuals.\n\nTherefore, while the study results are statistically significant, they are not clinically significant, as the difference in mean time for resolution of symptoms is unlikely to be noticeable or meaningful to patients.

The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?\n\n(A) Atrial fibrillation\n(B) Cor pulmonale\n(C) Systemic hypertension\n(D) Tricuspid valve regurgitation",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, the patient is at greatest risk for systemic hypertension.\n\nThe patient has a grade 3/6 systolic murmur, which is consistent with mitral valve regurgitation. However, the cardiac examination also reveals a radiofemoral delay, which is suggestive of coarctation of the aorta. Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aorta that occurs between the left subclavian artery and the ductus arteriosus. This can result in systemic hypertension, as the flow of blood to the lower half of the body is reduced.\n\nCor pulmonale, which is enlargement and dysfunction of the right ventricle due to pulmonary hypertension, is typically associated with lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pulmonary embolism. Although the patient has a history of pneumonia, there is no indication that he has a lung disease that would put him at risk for cor pulmonale.\n\nAtrial fibrillation is an irregular and often rapid heart rhythm that can result in poor blood flow to the body, leading to an increased risk of stroke. However, there is no evidence in the patient's history or physical examination to suggest that he is at risk for atrial fibrillation.\n\nTricuspid valve regurgitation, which is a leaky tricuspid valve that allows blood to flow back into the right atrium instead of forward to the right ventricle, can cause volume overload and lead to heart failure. However, this is typically a less serious condition than systemic hypertension, and it is not clear that the patient has tricuspid valve regurgitation based on the information provided.\n\nBased on the patient's history and physical examination findings, systemic hypertension is the most likely complication that he is at risk for, and therefore answer (C) is correct.",

She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the symptoms and the patient's history. The patient is experiencing numbness and tingling in the right ring and small fingers, which suggests a problem with a nerve in the arm. Entrapment of a nerve can cause these symptoms.\n\nWe need to consider which nerve is most likely to be entrapped based on the location of the symptoms and the patient's history. The patient is right-handed and used to play softball, which puts stress on the elbow. She also has pain in the right elbow, which suggests that the problem may be at or near the elbow.\n\nThe median nerve is responsible for sensation in the thumb, index finger, and middle finger, but not the ring finger or small finger. Therefore, entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist is unlikely to cause the symptoms described.\n\nThe musculocutaneous nerve provides sensation to the lateral part of the arm and the forearm, but not the hand. Entrapment of this nerve at the forearm is also unlikely to be the cause of the symptoms.\n\nThe radial nerve supplies sensation to the back of the hand and the thumb, but not the ring finger or small finger. Therefore, entrapment of this nerve at the forearm is a possible cause of the symptoms.\n\nHowever, the ulnar nerve is responsible for sensation in the ring finger and small finger, and entrapment of this nerve at the elbow is also a possible cause of the symptoms.\n\nBased on the information provided, entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

The increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits which of the following processes in these subjects?\n\n(A) Fatty acid oxidation\n(B) Fatty acid synthesis\n(C) Gluconeogenesis\n(D) Glycogenolysis",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the role of malonyl-CoA in the regulation of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and other possible processes that may be affected by elevated malonyl-CoA levels.\n\nFatty acid oxidation refers to the process of breaking down fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, which can then be used in the citric acid cycle for energy production. Malonyl-CoA is a product of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA serves as a feedback inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I), a critical enzyme in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation. When the concentration of malonyl-CoA is high, it binds to and inhibits CPT I, reducing the rate of fatty acid transport into the mitochondria and inhibiting fatty acid oxidation.\n\nOn the other hand, fatty acid synthesis refers to the process of converting glucose and other metabolic substrates into fatty acids for storage in adipose tissue or incorporation into cellular membranes. While acetyl-CoA is a precursor for fatty acid synthesis, malonyl-CoA is not directly involved in this process.\n\nGluconeogenesis is the process of converting non-carbohydrate substrates, such as lactate, alanine, and glycerol, into glucose for energy production. Malonyl-CoA is not directly involved in this process either.\n\nFinally, glycogenolysis refers to the breakdown of glycogen into glucose for energy production. While malonyl-CoA can inhibit glycogenolysis by reducing the activity of glycogen phosphorylase, this effect is less pronounced compared to its inhibition of fatty acid oxidation.\n\nBased on the above information, we can conclude that increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits fatty acid oxidation, making this the correct answer to the question.",

The patient's symptoms of progressive irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, frequent bowel movements, and weight loss are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The presence of a neck mass and an enlarged thyroid gland with areas of increased and decreased uptake on the 131I scan suggest a thyroid disorder.\n\nThe four possible diagnoses provided are:\n\n- Defect in T4 biosynthesis\n- Graves' disease\n- Multinodular goiter\n- Riedel's thyroiditis\n\nLet's consider each of these diagnoses and eliminate them one by one.\n\nDefect in T4 biosynthesis: This is a condition in which the body is unable to produce enough T4, leading to decreased thyroid hormone levels and hypothyroidism. The symptoms of hypothyroidism are generally the opposite of hyperthyroidism, and do not match the patient's symptoms of irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, and weight loss. Therefore, this diagnosis can be ruled out.\n\nGraves' disease: This is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. It is characterized by the production of antibodies that stimulate the thyroid gland to produce excess thyroid hormone. The patient's symptoms of irritability, palpitations, and heat intolerance are consistent with Graves' disease. However, the presence of a neck mass and an enlarged thyroid gland with areas of increased and decreased uptake on the 131I scan suggest a thyroid disorder other than Graves' disease.\n\nMultinodular goiter: This is a condition in which the thyroid gland becomes enlarged and develops multiple nodules. It can cause hyperthyroidism if the nodules produce excess thyroid hormone. The patient's symptoms of palpitations and weight loss are consistent with hyperthyroidism, but the symptoms of irritability and frequent bowel movements are not specific to this condition. The presence of a neck mass and an enlarged thyroid gland with areas of increased and decreased uptake on the 131I scan suggest a thyroid disorder.\n\nRiedel's thyroiditis: This is a rare disorder characterized by the inflammation and fibrosis of the entire thyroid gland, leading to hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. The patient's symptoms of irritability, palpitations, and weight loss are not consistent with this condition. Therefore, this diagnosis can be ruled out.\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms and the findings on the 131I scan, the most likely diagnosis is a thyroid disorder other than Graves' disease, such as multinodular goiter.",
