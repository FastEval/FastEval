            "model_answer": "Let's start by breaking down the question. \n\nWhat are the main factors preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically?\n\n(1) Lack of currency\n(2) Lack of well-connected transportation infrastructure\n(3) Lack of government activity\n(4) Lack of banking service\n\nGiven this information, we can easily eliminate (A), since currency is not a factor at all.\n\nNext, let's examine (B) and (C). While both (2) and (3) can hinder economic growth, neither are the *main* factor.\n\nThat leaves us with (D) - the lack of a banking service. Governments and transportation can both be beneficial, but banking is the most vital part of an economic system. Without being able to borrow money, invest, or secure capital, an economy will struggle to advance.\n\nThe final answer is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand the meaning of each option:\n\n(A) Zero population growth (ZPG) refers to a situation where the total number of people in a population remains constant over time, usually as a result of replacement-level fertility (the number of children born per woman is enough to replace the parents in the population).\n\n(B) A rapid growth rate is a high rate of population increase, usually caused by a high birth rate or a large influx of new people into an area.\n\n(C) A homeostatic plateau is a stable state of population size reached when the birth rate and death rate are balanced and there is no net population growth or decline.\n\n(D) Demographic momentum refers to the tendency of a population to continue growing for some time after its fertility rate has fallen below replacement level, due to the \"lag time\" between changes in fertility and changes in population size.\n\nBased on these definitions, we can eliminate (A) and (C) since neither of them describes a situation where population growth continues long after replacement fertility has been achieved. Option (B) is also incorrect since it refers to a high growth rate, while demographic momentum involves continued growth but at a slower rate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be (D) demographic momentum. To further explain this concept, it's important to understand why population growth continues after fertility has dropped below replacement level. When a population's fertility rate falls, the number of children born in each generation decreases, which should eventually result in a smaller population size. However, because it takes time for this decrease to occur (due to the lag between fertility and population size), the population continues to grow for a period of time after fertility has fallen below replacement level. This lag time is what creates the demographic momentum that causes population growth to continue even after fertility has fallen below replacement level.",

            "question": "The tendency for migration to decrease with distance is called\n\n(A) push factors.\n(B) pull factors.\n(C) distance decay.\n(D) migration selectivity.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) distance decay. Here's my reasoning:\n\n- Distance decay refers to the tendency for migration to decrease with distance.\n- Distance decay is a phenomenon observed in many areas, such as transportation, communication, and migration.\n- The concept of distance decay is based on the idea that the farther away a destination is, the less likely it is to be visited or inhabited.\n- There are several reasons why distance decay occurs. One reason is that the cost of travel increases with distance, making it less attractive to migrate long distances.\n- Another reason is that the likelihood of social and economic ties between two locations decreases with distance, making it less likely that people will migrate between them.\n- Finally, the availability of information about distant destinations may also be limited, making it more difficult for migrants to assess their options and make decisions about where to move.\n- Based on the above, we can conclude that distance decay is the correct answer.",

            "model_answer": "Let's break this down step-by-step and see which answer fits best:\n\n1. Most women work in agriculture: This statement is FALSE. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), in 2019, the largest share of working women was in the services sector, followed by industry (including agriculture) and then by agriculture.\n2. The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide: This statement is FALSE. According to the ILO, the global female labor force participation rate increased from 52% in 1990 to 49% in 2019. However, this rate varies significantly by region, with the lowest rates in Arab States (20%) and Southern Asia (27%) and the highest rates in Northern America (60%) and Europe (58%).\n3. The percentage of women in the total labor force declined: This statement is FALSE. According to the ILO, the global female labor force participation rate increased from 52% in 1990 to 49% in 2019, as mentioned earlier. This means that the percentage of women in the total labor force has increased during this time period.\n4. Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia: This statement is FALSE. According to the ILO, in 2019, women worldwide spent an average of 4.5 hours per day on unpaid domestic and care work, while men spent an average of 1.7 hours per day. However, this also varies significantly by region, with women in Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa spending the most time on unpaid domestic and care work (7.3 and 6.9 hours per day, respectively) and men in Northern America and Europe spending the least time on unpaid domestic and care work (1.0 and 1.2 hours per day, respectively).\n\nBased on the above analysis, the statement that best fits the provided information is option (C) - The percentage of women in the total labor force declined. Therefore, the correct answer is option (D) - Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the factor that is not a pull factor of migration, we need to examine each of the given answers and see if they fit the definition of a pull factor.\n\nA pull factor is a factor that motivates people to move to a new location, usually for economic, social, or political reasons.\n\nSafety is a pull factor. If an area is unsafe due to political unrest, crime, or natural disasters, people may choose to leave to find a safer place to live.\n\nBetter climate can also be a pull factor. If a region has a more temperate climate or offers more opportunities for outdoor activities, it may attract migrants who are seeking a better quality of life.\n\nBetter schools can also be a pull factor. If a region has high-quality schools with a good reputation, parents may choose to move there to ensure that their children receive a good education.\n\nOvercrowding, on the other hand, is not a pull factor. Overcrowding typically occurs when there is a high population density in a specific area, but it is not a reason why people would choose to move there.\n\nBased on this information, the answer that is not a pull factor of migration is D.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the listed countries does not have a well-known example of a relict boundary, we need to define what we mean by a relict boundary and then assess which countries have examples that match this definition.\n\nA relict boundary is a geological feature that marks the point where two tectonic plates have collided in the past but have since moved apart, leaving behind a distinct boundary between the two plates. Examples of relict boundaries include mountain ranges, fault lines, and ancient shorelines.\n\nNow let's consider the four countries listed in the question and see if any of them have well-known examples of relict boundaries.\n\nVietnam: The country of Vietnam is located in Southeast Asia and is bordered by the South China Sea to the east. While there are some active fault lines and minor mountain ranges in Vietnam, there are no well-known examples of relict boundaries that fit the definition we are using.\n\nUnited Kingdom: The United Kingdom is made up of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland and is located off the northwest coast of continental Europe. The UK is part of the Eurasian Plate, but the boundary between the Eurasian Plate and the North American Plate runs through the Atlantic Ocean, so there are no well-known relict boundaries within the UK.\n\nGermany: Germany is located in central Europe and is bordered by several countries, including Denmark to the north and Austria to the south. The country is part of the European Plate, and while there are some minor mountain ranges and fault lines within Germany, there are no well-known examples of relict boundaries that fit the definition we are using.\n\nBolivia: Bolivia is a landlocked country located in central South America and is bordered by Brazil to the northeast, Paraguay to the southeast, Argentina to the south, and Peru to the west. While there are some mountain ranges within Bolivia that may have been formed as a result of tectonic plate movement in the past, there are no well-known examples of relict boundaries within the country.\n\nBased on our definition of a relict boundary and a review of the geological features of each country, it appears that the answer to the question is D) Bolivia. While there may be some geological features in Bolivia that were influenced by tectonic plate movement in the past, there are no well-known examples of relict boundaries within the country.",

It can be seen as an inward force that holds people together.\n\n3. A national holiday: A national holiday can be a unifying factor for a country. Therefore, it can be seen as an inward force that holds people together.\n\n4. An attack by another country: An attack by another country can certainly cause centrifugal force, as it might lead to conflicts and divisions within the attacked country.\n\n5. A charismatic national leader: A charismatic national leader can also cause centrifugal force, as he or she might create divisions within the country through controversial policies or actions.\n\nBased on the above considerations, it can be concluded that option (D) is the correct answer.\n\nA: Religious differences\nB: A national holiday\nC: An attack by another country\nD: A charismatic national leader",

            "correct_answer": 3,

Climate, forest cover, manufacturing, and trade routes are likely all important factors, but which one is the most important?\n\nOne factor that stands out is access to water. Without a reliable source of water, settlements cannot survive, and population density cannot be high. This suggests that the answer is likely (B) Limited forest cover.\n\nForests can provide a reliable source of water through rainfall interception, groundwater recharge, and stream flow regulation. However, when forests are dense, they can limit the amount of sunlight that reaches the ground, making it difficult for plants to grow and for animals to find food. This can make it difficult for settlements to thrive in these areas.\n\nIn contrast, areas with limited forest cover would have more sunlight reaching the ground, making it easier for plants to grow and for animals to find food. This would make it easier for settlements to thrive in these areas.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the correct answer is likely (B) Limited forest cover.",
