The tone of this statement appears to be sincere and positive, without any sarcasm.\n\nStatement (B) says \"He's a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need.\" This statement criticizes the person, referring to them as a terrible person despite their efforts in promoting a successful charity stream that has raised millions of dollars for children. The tone of this statement suggests sarcasm, as it contradicts the positive outcome of the charity stream with a negative remark about the person involved.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is (B) \"He's a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need.\" \n\n(B)",

Sarcasm is a form of irony that often involves saying the opposite of what is meant, usually to convey mockery, scorn, or ridicule.\n\nLet's analyze statement (A): \"Hey just be happy then you won't be depressed anymore.\" This statement seems straightforward and does not contain any ironic or sarcastic elements. It suggests that being happy is the solution to not being depressed.\n\nNow let's analyze statement (B): \"Hey just be happy that you won't be depressed anymore.\" This statement includes the phrase \"just be happy,\" which is similar to statement (A). However, the addition of \"that you won't be depressed anymore\" adds an element of irony. It implies that it is easy or simple to be happy when the reality is often more complex and difficult. The use of the phrase \"just be happy\" in this context can be interpreted as sarcasm.\n\nBased on our analysis, it appears that statement (B) is sarcastic.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

It implies a sarcastic tone by suggesting that having more children with these issues would be undesirable.\n\nStatement (B): \"Because this world needs more kids with trust issues and psychological problems than we already have!\"\nThis statement uses positive language and suggests that the world does need more children with trust issues and psychological problems. It can be taken literally, without any sarcasm or irony.\n\nBased on the analysis above, it is clear that Statement (A) is sarcastic, while Statement (B) is not sarcastic.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(A)",
