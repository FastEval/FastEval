To identify the conclusion, we need to look for a statement that summarizes the overall message or main idea of the argument.\n\nThe first sentence introduces the idea that there is a correlation between weakened intelligence due to emotions in our peers and in our everyday patients. This statement provides background information but is not the main point of the argument.\n\nThe second sentence discusses the arrogance of our consciousness as a strong defense mechanism that blocks unconscious complexes.
