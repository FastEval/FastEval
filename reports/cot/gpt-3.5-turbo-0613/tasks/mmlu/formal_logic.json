(\u2203y)(Hy \u2022 Bxy): This part states that there exists a house that is smaller than some other object. This can be understood as \"Some house is smaller than something.\"\n\n3. Combining the two parts using parentheses: [(Ax \u2022 Lx) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Hy \u2022 Bxy)] means that there exists an apartment that is large and there exists a house that is smaller than something.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\n(A) Some large houses are bigger than some apartments. This matches our analysis. The proposition allows for the possibility that some houses are smaller than apartments, so this is a valid interpretation.\n\n(B) Some houses are bigger than all large apartments. The proposition does not state that the houses in question are bigger than all large apartments, so this interpretation is not supported.\n\n(C) Some large apartments are bigger than some houses. This matches our analysis. The proposition allows for the possibility that some apartments are bigger than houses, so this is a valid interpretation.\n\n(D) Some houses are bigger than some large apartments. This matches our analysis. The proposition explicitly states that there exists a house that is smaller than something, so this is a valid interpretation.\n\nBased on our analysis, options (A), (C), and (D) are all valid interpretations. We need to further analyze to determine the best interpretation.\n\nConsidering the proposition as a whole, the focus is on the existence of large apartments and the existence of houses smaller than something. The proposition does not explicitly state which one is bigger than the other. However, the use of \"Lx\" (large apartment) and \"Hy\" (house) suggests that the focus is on some large apartments being bigger than some houses.\n\nTherefore, the best English interpretation of the given proposition is: (C) Some large apartments are bigger than some houses.",

For the first premise, ~G \u2283 H, we can determine the truth value for each row using the rules of implication (\"\u2192\"):\n- When G is true (\"T\"), ~G is false (\"F\"). So, ~G \u2283 H is true as long as H is true.\n- When G is false (\"F\"), ~G is true (\"T\"). So, ~G \u2283 H is true regardless of the truth value of H.\n\nOur updated truth table now looks like this:\nG | H | ~G \u2283 H\n--------------\nT | T | T\nT | F | T\nF | T | T\nF | F | T\n\n2.

Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nTo find a counterexample, we look for a row where the conclusion (G) is false while all the premises are true. In this case, the counterexample occurs when G is false and H is true. Looking at the truth table, we can see this counterexample in the fourth row.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (D) Invalid.
