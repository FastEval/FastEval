The Pythagorean theorem states that for any right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Let's use this information to find the equation of the line passing through these two points.\n\nStep 2: The slope of the line passing through these two points is equal to the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$. We can calculate it as follows: \\[\\text{slope} = \\frac{{f(b) - f(a)}}{{b - a}}\\] where $a = -2$, $b = 2$, $f(a) = 5$, and $f(b) = 9$. Plugging in these values, we get: \\[\\text{slope} = \\frac{{9 - 5}}{{2 - (-2)}} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1\\]\n\nStep 3: Now that we know the slope of the line passing through the points $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$ is equal to $1$, we can write the equation of this line using the point-slope form: \\[y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\] where $m$ is the slope, and $(x_1, y_1)$ is any point on the line. Let's use the first given point $(x_1, y_1) = (-2,5)$ to write the equation of the line: \\[y - 5 = 1(x - (-2))\\] Simplifying, we get: \\[y - 5 = x + 2\\]\n\nStep 4: Let's rewrite this equation in slope-intercept form $(y = mx + b)$ to make it easier to work with: \\[y = x + 7\\]\n\nStep 5: We are told that the portion of the graph of $y = f(x)$ between any two points $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$ lies below the line segment with endpoints $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$. Let's visualize this information and consider the point $(1, f(1))$.\n\nStep 6: Since $(1, f(1))$ lies on the graph of $y = f(x)$ and the portion of the graph between any two points lies below the line segment connecting them, the point $(1, f(1))$ must also lie below the line $y = x + 7$. \n\nStep 7: In other words, at $(x = 1)$, the value of $f(x)$ (which we'll call $y$) must be less than or equal to the value of $x + 7$. Therefore, we have the inequality: \\[y \\leq x + 7\\]\n\nStep 8: To find the range of possible values for $f(1)$, we need to find the maximum possible value of $f(1)$. We can do this by finding the maximum value of $x + 7$ greater than or equal to $f(1)$.\n\nStep 9: Since the inequality is inclusive (includes equality), the maximum value of $x + 7$ greater than or equal to $f(1)$ will be $x + 7 = f(1)$. Therefore, we need to find the maximum value of $x + 7$.\n\nStep 10: Since we are looking for the maximum value of $x + 7$ given the constraints, we want to minimize the value of $x$. From the given information, the range of possible $x$ values is $-2 \\leq x \\leq 2$. We want to find the smallest possible value of $x$, which occurs when $x = -2$.\n\nStep 11: Plugging in $x = -2$ into $x + 7$, we get $-2 + 7 = 5$. Therefore, the maximum value of $x + 7$ is $5$.\n\nStep 12: Since $x + 7$ represents the maximum value for $f(1)$, the range of all possible values for $f(1)$ is $(-\\infty, 5]$, where $-\\infty$ indicates that there is no lower bound.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{\\text{(D) (-inf, 7)}}$",
