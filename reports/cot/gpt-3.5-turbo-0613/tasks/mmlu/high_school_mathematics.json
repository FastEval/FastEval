According to the problem, the length of the rectangle is twice its width, so the length of the rectangle can be represented as $2w$. \n\nWe know that the length, width, and diagonal of a rectangle form a right triangle. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs (the sides that are not the hypotenuse) is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. In our case, the legs are the width $w$ and the length $2w$, and the hypotenuse is the diagonal $5\\sqrt{5}$.

We are interested in finding the range of possible values for $f(1)$.

Since we are interested in the possible values for $f(1)$, we substitute $x=1$ into the equation to find $y=1+7=8$. Therefore, the upper bound for $f(1)$ is $8$.\n\nHence, the range of all possible values for $f(1)$ is $(-\\infty, 8)$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(C) (-inf, 8)}}$.",
