The second extension is over Q(sqrt(2)), which means we are adding sqrt(3). The minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)) is x^2 - 3, so the degree of this extension is also 2.\n\n3. Finally, the third extension is over Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), which means we are adding sqrt(18). The minimal polynomial of sqrt(18) over Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is x^2 - 18 = (x - sqrt(18))(x + sqrt(18)).

In order for a factor group to be Abelian, all the cosets must commute.\n\nTo assess the truth of this statement, we need to consider a non-Abelian group and form a factor group. The dihedral group D6, which consists of the symmetries of a regular hexagon, is a non-Abelian group. The subgroup of D6 generated by a 180-degree rotation (R) is normal, so we can use it to form a factor group.\n\nIf we take the factor group D6/R, also known as the symmetry group of a regular triangle, we can see that it is indeed non-Abelian. This is because one of the cosets corresponds to the identity element and the other corresponds to a 120-degree rotation (r). The elements in these cosets do not commute. Therefore, the statement \"A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian\" is true.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\nTo assess the truth of this statement, we need to consider the definition of a normal subgroup and how normality is preserved under subgroup and factor group operations.\n\nA subgroup K of a group G is normal if and only if gKg^(-1) \u2286 K for every g in G. In other words, if conjugating any element in K by any element in G keeps the result within K.\n\nIf H is a normal subgroup of G, then gHg^(-1) \u2286 H for every g in G. Similarly, if K is a normal subgroup of H, then hKh^(-1) \u2286 K for every h in H.\n\nTo determine if K is a normal subgroup of G, we need to show that gKg^(-1) \u2286 K for every g in G. By substituting hg for g, we have:\n(hg)K(hg)^(-1) = h(gKg^(-1))h^(-1)\n\nSince gKg^(-1) \u2286 K for every g in G and h is also an element of G, h(gKg^(-1))h^(-1) \u2286 hKh^(-1) \u2286 K.\n\nTherefore, if K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.

In other words, if we have two rings R and S, a function f: R -> S is a ring homomorphism if it satisfies the following properties:\n1. f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) for all a, b in R (preservation of addition).\n2. f(ab) = f(a)f(b) for all a, b in R (preservation of multiplication).\n3. f(1) = 1, where 1 is the multiplicative identity in R.\n\nNow, for a ring homomorphism f: R -> S, the kernel of f is defined as the set of elements in R that are mapped to the additive identity element of S. So, the kernel of f, denoted as ker(f), is defined as:\nker(f) = {a in R | f(a) = 0}.\n\nGiven these definitions, we can evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 1.\n\nTo show that \"A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0},\" we need to prove two statements:\n1. If a ring homomorphism is one to one, then the kernel is {0}.\n2. If the kernel is {0}, then a ring homomorphism is one to one.\n\nLet's evaluate these statements one by one.\n\n1. If a ring homomorphism is one to one, then the kernel is {0}:\nTo prove this statement, we assume that f: R -> S is a ring homomorphism that is one to one. We need to show that ker(f) = {0}. If f is one to one, it means that for any two elements a, b in R, if f(a) = f(b), then a = b. \nNow, let's consider an element c in ker(f). This means that f(c) = 0. Since {0} is the additive identity element in S, we have f(0) = 0. Therefore, ker(f) = {0}.\n\n2. If the kernel is {0}, then a ring homomorphism is one to one:\nTo prove this statement, we assume that f: R -> S is a ring homomorphism and ker(f) = {0}. We need to show that f is one to one. \nLet's consider two elements a, b in R. If f(a) = f(b), we want to show that a = b. Since f(a) = f(b), we have f(a) - f(b) = 0. Using the properties of ring homomorphism, we can rewrite this as f(a - b) = 0. Since the kernel is {0}, this implies that a - b = 0, which means a = b. Therefore, f is one to one.\n\nSince both statements have been proven to be true, we can conclude that Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, let's move on to evaluating Statement 2: \"Q is an ideal in R.\"\n\nAn ideal in a ring refers to a subset that satisfies certain conditions and behaves well under ring operations. Q usually denotes the set of rational numbers, and R denotes a ring.\n\nTo evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 2, we need to determine whether Q satisfies the conditions of being an ideal in R.\n\nAn ideal I in a ring R must satisfy the following properties:\n1. I is a subset of R.\n2. I is a subgroup of the additive group of R.\n3. For any a in I and any r in R, the product ar and ra are both in I.\n\nWe have Q as the potential ideal and R is not specified. However, we know that Q is a field, meaning it has specific properties. In particular, Q is not only a ring, but also a field, so it satisfies all the properties needed for an ideal.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nBased on the evaluation of both Statement 1 and Statement 2, the answer is (A) True, True.",
