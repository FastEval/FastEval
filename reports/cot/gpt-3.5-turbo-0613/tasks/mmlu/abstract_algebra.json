To determine if this statement is true or false, we need to understand the definitions involved.\n\n- A factor group, also known as a quotient group, is a group formed by partitioning a group into subsets determined by a normal subgroup.\n- An Abelian group is a group where the group operation is commutative. In other words, for any elements a and b in the group, a * b = b * a.\n\nIf a factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian, this means that even if the original group is not commutative, the factor group still won't be commutative.\n\nTo verify this, let's consider a counterexample. We can construct a non-Abelian group G and a normal subgroup K such that the factor group G/K is Abelian. This counterexample would prove Statement 1 false.\n\nStep 2: Let's analyze Statement 2:\nStatement 2 states that if K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G. To determine if this statement is true or false, we again need to understand the definitions involved.\n\n- A normal subgroup is a subgroup that is preserved under conjugation by all elements of the original group. In other words, for any element g in G and any element k in K, the conjugate of k by g (gkg^(-1)) is still in K.\n- If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, it means that K satisfies the definition of a normal subgroup for both H and G.\n\nTo verify this, let's examine the properties of normal subgroups and their relationship to the original group. If K is a normal subgroup of both H and G, then we can infer that K is also a normal subgroup of G. This property follows from the transitivity of normal subgroups.\n\nStep 3: Based on the analysis of Statement 1 and Statement 2, we can deduce the following:\n- Statement 1 is false because a counterexample can be constructed.\n- Statement 2 is true because it follows from the transitivity of normal subgroups.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) False, True",
