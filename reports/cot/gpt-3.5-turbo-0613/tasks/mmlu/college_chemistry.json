This means that even if the concentration of A changes, the rate of the reaction remains constant.\n\nLet's assume that the rate constant for the zero-order reaction is represented by \"k\".\n\nIf the rate of reaction is independent of the concentration of A, it means that the rate law expression (r) should not contain [A]. Therefore, we can eliminate options (A), (B), and (C) since they all include [A] in their rate law expressions.\n\nThis leaves us with option (D), which is \"r = k\". In this case, the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the rate constant \"k\" and is independent of the concentration of A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).",

Not all molecular bonds absorb infrared radiation. Only certain types of bonds, such as those containing atoms with dipole moments, absorb infrared radiation. Therefore, we can eliminate option (A).\n\n(B) IR peak intensities are related to molecular mass - This statement is also not true. The infrared peak intensities observed in a spectrum are not directly related to molecular mass. The intensity of infrared absorption depends on factors such as bond strength, dipole moment, and the number of bonds with a particular functional group. Therefore, we can eliminate option (B).\n\n(C) most organic functional groups absorb in a characteristic region of the IR spectrum - This statement is correct. Organic functional groups have characteristic bonds that absorb infrared radiation at specific wavelengths. By observing which wavelengths are absorbed, we can identify the presence or absence of certain functional groups in an organic molecule. This makes infrared spectroscopy a useful tool for determining aspects of organic molecule structure. Therefore, option (C) could be the correct answer.\n\n(D) each element absorbs at a characteristic wavelength - This statement is not true. While different elements do have characteristic absorption wavelengths in other spectroscopic techniques (such as atomic absorption spectroscopy), this is not the case in infrared spectroscopy. Infrared spectroscopy is specific to analyzing the vibrational modes of molecular bonds, rather than elemental absorption. Therefore, we can eliminate option (D).\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct answer is (C)",
