            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the information given. \n\nThe question asks for the percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who were overweight as of 2016. We can assume that the percentage will be between 0% and 100%, as it is unlikely that all adults would be either underweight or overweight.\n\nTo begin, we need to understand what is considered \"overweight.\" The most common method to determine this is by using the body mass index (BMI). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a BMI greater than or equal to 25 is considered overweight.\n\nNext, we should look for relevant data or statistics from credible sources. The question does not provide any specific data, so we will need to rely on general knowledge. It is important to note that these values can vary based on location, lifestyle, and other factors.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the United States, the prevalence of obesity (a higher BMI category) among adults was around 40% as of 2016. However, the question asks for the percentage of adults who were overweight (BMI 25 or higher), not specifically obese. Therefore, we can estimate that the percentage of adults who were overweight might be lower than 40%.\n\nTo narrow down our options, let's eliminate the higher percentages. \n\n(A) 10% - This seems too low, considering the prevalence of obesity is already around 40%.\n\n(B) 20% - This is still fairly low compared to the prevalence of obesity.\n\n(C) 40% - This matches the prevalence of obesity but does not specifically represent the percentage of adults who were overweight (BMI 25 or higher).\n\n(D) 80% - This seems too high, as it implies that the vast majority of adults were overweight.\n\nBased on the information provided and our analysis, the most reasonable answer appears to be (B) 20%.\n\n(B) 20%",

            "question": "What was GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 when adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices?\n\n(A) About $300\n(B) About $3k\n(C) About $8k\n(D) About $15k",

            "model_answer": "To find the GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 when adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices, we need to go through several steps.\n\nStep 1: Find the nominal GDP in the United States in 1850.\nTo do this, we can use historical data on the nominal GDP of the United States. According to the World Bank, the nominal GDP of the United States in 1850 was approximately $2.0 billion.\n\nStep 2: Adjust for inflation.\nSince we want to find the GDP per capita in 1850 in 2011 prices, we need to adjust for inflation using the GDP deflator. To do this, we need to find the GDP deflator for 1850 and for 2011. However, historical data on the GDP deflator for 1850 is not readily available.\n\nStep 3: Estimate the GDP deflator for 1850.\nSince we don't have the exact GDP deflator for 1850, we can make an estimation based on available data. We can use the GDP deflators for neighboring years and make assumptions about the inflation rate in 1850. Let's assume that the GDP deflator for 1850 is approximately 8.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the real GDP in 1850.\nTo calculate the real GDP in 1850, we divide the nominal GDP by the GDP deflator for that year. Using the assumptions made in step 3, the real GDP in 1850 would be $2.0 billion / 8 = $0.25 billion.\n\nStep 5: Find the population of the United States in 1850.\nTo calculate the GDP per capita, we need to know the population of the United States in 1850. According to historical data, the population of the United States in 1850 was approximately 23.1 million.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the GDP per capita in 1850.\nTo calculate the GDP per capita in 1850, we divide the real GDP by the population. Using the figures from step 4 and step 5, the GDP per capita in 1850 would be $0.25 billion / 23.1 million = $10.82.\n\nStep 7: Adjust for PPP in 2011 prices.\nTo adjust for PPP in 2011 prices, we need to multiply the GDP per capita in 1850 by the PPP conversion factor. Since we don't have the exact PPP conversion factor for 1850, we can use the historical PPP conversion factor for the United States in 2011, which is approximately 1.0.\n\nStep 8: Calculate the adjusted GDP per capita in 2011 prices.\nTo calculate the adjusted GDP per capita in 2011 prices, we multiply the GDP per capita in 1850 by the PPP conversion factor for 2011. Using the figures from step 6 and step 7, the adjusted GDP per capita in 2011 prices would be $10.82 * 1.0 = $10.82.\n\nThe answer is (A) About $10.82.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the biggest cause of death in children under five years old as of 2017, we can look at global statistics and compare the mortality rates for each of the given options.\n\nStep 1: Consider Lower Respiratory Infections\nLower respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, are a significant cause of death among young children worldwide. Pneumonia is a common and potentially deadly infection in children, especially in developing countries with limited access to healthcare. It is a notable cause of infant mortality and could potentially be the biggest cause of death in children under five years old.\n\nStep 2: Consider Preterm Birth Complications\nPreterm birth complications can also lead to a high mortality rate among children under five years old. Babies born prematurely often face significant health challenges and are at an increased risk of complications. Their underdeveloped organs and immune systems make them vulnerable to infections and other life-threatening conditions.\n\nStep 3: Consider Diarrheal Diseases\nDiarrheal diseases, such as cholera and rotavirus, can be severe and deadly, particularly in young children. These diseases often result from poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water. Diarrhea can quickly lead to dehydration, especially in infants and young children, potentially causing death if not appropriately managed.\n\nStep 4: Consider Malaria\nMalaria is a parasitic infection transmitted by mosquito bites. While malaria primarily affects populations in tropical and subtropical regions, it can be a significant cause of death in children under five years old in affected areas. Malaria can lead to severe complications and organ failure, particularly if left untreated.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion\nAfter considering all the options, it is essential to determine which cause of death is the biggest among children under five years old as of 2017. Lower respiratory infections, preterm birth complications, diarrheal diseases, and malaria are all significant factors contributing to child mortality. However, to find the most significant cause, we need to analyze the global statistics for each condition.\n\nThe answer, based on global statistics, is:\n\n(A) Lower respiratory infections",
