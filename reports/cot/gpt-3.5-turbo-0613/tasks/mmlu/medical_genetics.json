            "model_answer": "A Robertsonian translocation is a specific type of chromosomal abnormality where two acrocentric chromosomes (chromosomes with a very short p arm and a long q arm) fuse together at their centromeres, resulting in a single fused chromosome. \n\nTo answer the question, we need to determine where the fusion occurs in a Robertsonian translocation.\n\nOption (A) - Telomeres: The telomeres are the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes, and they are responsible for maintaining chromosomal stability. However, in a Robertsonian translocation, the fusion occurs at the centromeres, not at the telomeres.\n\nOption (B) - Centromeres: The centromere is the constricted region of a chromosome that is essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division. In a Robertsonian translocation, the fusion occurs at the centromeres of two acrocentric chromosomes.\n\nOption (C) - Histones: Histones are proteins that help package and organize DNA into a structural form called chromatin. While histones play an important role in DNA packaging, they are not directly involved in the fusion of chromosomes in a Robertsonian translocation.\n\nOption (D) - Ends of the long arms: The long arm of a chromosome is the q arm. In a Robertsonian translocation, the fusion occurs at the centromeres of the two acrocentric chromosomes, not at the ends of the long arms.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) centromeres.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question step-by-step, we need to analyze the characteristics and functions of zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins.\n\n1. Zinc finger proteins: \n   - Zinc finger proteins are a type of protein that contains zinc ions, which help them bind to DNA.\n   - They have a specific DNA-binding domain called a zinc finger motif.\n   - Zinc finger proteins are known to regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences.\n\n2. Helix-turn-helix proteins:\n   - Helix-turn-helix proteins are a structural motif commonly found in DNA-binding proteins.\n   - They consist of two alpha helices connected by a short turn of amino acids.\n   - This structural motif enables them to recognize and bind specific DNA sequences.\n\nBased on this information, we can evaluate the options:\n\n(A) types of DNA-binding proteins: Both zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are types of DNA-binding proteins since they are specifically designed to bind and interact with DNA sequences.\n\n(B) involved in the control of translation: Zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are primarily involved in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, not in the control of translation, which involves the synthesis of proteins.\n\n(C) components of ribosomes: Ribosomes are large molecular complexes consisting of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and proteins. Neither zinc finger proteins nor helix-turn-helix proteins are part of the ribosomes.\n\n(D) part of the hemoglobin in blood cells: Hemoglobin is a protein responsible for binding and transporting oxygen in red blood cells. Neither zinc finger proteins nor helix-turn-helix proteins are part of the hemoglobin.\n\nAfter evaluating these options, we can conclude that zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are types of DNA-binding proteins (A).\n\nAnswer: (A)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To find the expected frequency of affected females, we need to consider the inheritance pattern of the X-linked recessive condition.\n\nIn humans, males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. The condition is recessive, meaning that females need to inherit two copies of the affected gene to be affected, while males only need to inherit one copy.\n\nSince the frequency of affected males is given as 0.10 (one in ten), we can assume that the frequency of individuals who carry one copy of the affected gene is 0.10.\n\nTo find the expected frequency of affected females, we can use the following equation:\n\n(expected frequency of affected females) = (frequency of carriers in the population) \u00d7 (probability of being affected given two copies of the affected gene)\n\nSince the frequency of carriers in the population is 0.10, we need to determine the probability of being affected given two copies of the affected gene.\n\nSince the condition is X-linked recessive, a female can only be affected if both her X chromosomes carry the affected gene. The probability of this happening can be calculated as the probability of being a carrier (0.10) multiplied by the probability of inheriting two copies of the affected gene (0.10 for one X chromosome and 0.10 for the other X chromosome).\n\nSo, the probability of being affected given two copies of the affected gene is 0.10 \u00d7 0.10 \u00d7 0.10 = 0.001 (or 1 in 1000).\n\nNow we can calculate the expected frequency of affected females:\n\n(expected frequency of affected females) = (frequency of carriers in the population) \u00d7 (probability of being affected given two copies of the affected gene)\n(expected frequency of affected females) = 0.10 \u00d7 0.001 = 0.0001\n\nTherefore, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.0001 (D).",

            "model_answer": "To determine the pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia), we can consider the known characteristics of the disorder.\n\nStep 1: Understand the disorder\nMalignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is a rare pharmacogenetic disorder that is triggered by the use of certain medications during surgery. It is characterized by a severe reaction to these medications, which can lead to muscle rigidity, high fever, rapid heart rate, and other life-threatening symptoms.\n\nStep 2: Determine the inheritance pattern based on known traits\nIn this case, the question asks about the pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia. To do this, we can consider the known traits of the disorder. \n\nAutosomal dominant inheritance occurs when a single copy of the mutant allele is sufficient to cause the disorder. If one parent has the disorder, there is a 50% chance of passing it on to each child.\n\nAutosomal recessive inheritance occurs when two copies of the mutant allele are necessary to cause the disorder. Both parents must be carriers of the mutant allele to have a child with the disorder, and each child has a 25% chance of inheriting the disorder.\n\nX-linked dominant inheritance occurs when a mutant allele on the X chromosome causes the disorder. If a female has the mutant allele, she has a 50% chance of passing it on to each child. If a male has the mutant allele, he will pass it on to all of his daughters but none of his sons.\n\nX-linked recessive inheritance occurs when a mutant allele on the X chromosome causes the disorder. If a female is a carrier of the mutant allele, she has a 50% chance of passing it on to each of her children. If a male has the mutant allele, he will pass it on to all of his daughters but none of his sons.\n\nStep 3: Determine the most likely inheritance pattern\nSince the question does not provide any specific information about the disorder, we have to rely on general knowledge. Malignant hyperthermia is normally inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that if one parent has the disorder, there is a 50% chance of passing it on to each child.\n\nStep 4: Output the answer\nThe pattern of inheritance shown by malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is autosomal dominant.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze each statement and determine if it is true or false based on our knowledge of human chromosome mapping.\n\nStatement (A) states that the mapping of human chromosomes has been restricted to the sex chromosomes because of small family sizes. However, this statement is not true. Human chromosome mapping has been done for all of the chromosomes, not just the sex chromosomes. So, statement (A) is false.\n\nStatement (B) states that the mapping of human chromosomes proceeded much more successfully as large numbers of DNA makers became available. This statement is true. As technology has advanced, more and more DNA markers have become available, which has greatly improved the accuracy and efficiency of chromosome mapping. So, statement (B) is true.\n\nStatement (C) states that the mapping of human chromosomes has determined that the number of linkage groups is about twice the number of chromosomes. This statement is false. The number of linkage groups is actually the same as the number of chromosomes in humans.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question step-by-step, we need to understand the concept of exon skipping and its association with different types of mutations.\n\nExon skipping is a phenomenon in which one or more exons of a pre-mRNA transcript are not included in the final mRNA molecule during RNA processing. This process can lead to the production of alternative mRNA isoforms that may encode different protein products.\n\nNow, let's consider the options provided:\n\n(A) Nonsense mutations: Nonsense mutations are genetic mutations that introduce a premature stop codon in the mRNA sequence, leading to the production of a shortened and usually nonfunctional protein. Exon skipping is not directly associated with nonsense mutations because it does not involve the introduction of premature stop codons.\n\n(B) Regulatory mutations: Regulatory mutations affect the regulation of gene expression, such as changes in transcription factor binding sites or enhancer regions. While these mutations may indirectly influence RNA processing events, exon skipping is not specifically associated with regulatory mutations.\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations: RNA processing mutations refer to genetic mutations that affect the normal processing of pre-mRNA transcripts, including splicing, capping, and polyadenylation. Exon skipping is directly associated with RNA processing mutations because it involves the exclusion of specific exons during the splicing process.\n\n(D) Silent mutations: Silent mutations are genetic mutations that do not result in any change in the encoded amino acid sequence due to the redundancy of the genetic code. Exon skipping is not associated with silent mutations because it involves a change in the mRNA sequence and the potential production of alternative protein isoforms.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations.",
