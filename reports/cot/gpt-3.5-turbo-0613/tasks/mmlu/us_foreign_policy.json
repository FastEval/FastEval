            "model_answer": "The United Nations Security Council is composed of member countries that have the responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. \n\nStep 1: The Security Council has both permanent and rotating members. The permanent members hold veto power, which means they can block or veto any resolutions that are put forward by other members.\n\nStep 2: The rotating members do not have veto power but they have a temporary seat on the Council for a period of time before being replaced by another member.\n\nStep 3: Considering the options, we can eliminate option (B) because it states that all members, both permanent and rotating, have veto power, which is incorrect.\n\nStep 4: We can also eliminate option (C) because it states that there are 10 permanent members, which is incorrect. The Security Council has only 5 permanent members.\n\nStep 5: Similarly, we can eliminate option (D) because it states that there are 15 permanent members, which is incorrect. The Security Council has only 5 permanent members.\n\nStep 6: We are left with option (A), which states that there are 5 permanent members with veto power and 10 rotating members without veto power. This aligns with the structure described in step 1.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Recall the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution was a joint resolution passed by the United States Congress on August 7, 1964, in response to the Gulf of Tonkin incident. It granted US President Lyndon B. Johnson authorization, without a formal declaration of war by Congress, for the use of conventional military force in Southeast Asia, particularly in Vietnam.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each option:\n(A) It allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam: This is true. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution gave President Johnson the authority to escalate US involvement in Vietnam by using military force.\n(B) It illustrated the influence of public opinion on US foreign policy: This is partially true, but not the main significance of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. The resolution was mainly driven by the Johnson administration's efforts to expand US military involvement in Vietnam rather than being solely influenced by public opinion.\n(C) It enhanced Congressional control over the Vietnam War: This is not true. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution actually granted presidential authority and expanded the President's powers to use military force without explicit Congressional approval.\n(D) It curtailed US involvement in Vietnam: This is not true. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution had the opposite effect, as it provided the authority for the US to escalate its involvement in Vietnam.\n\nStep 3: Based on our analysis, the correct answer is (A) It allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

They carry out attacks aimed at causing harm, destruction, and instilling fear.\n\nB) Organized crime: Organized crime groups can pose a threat to the United States through activities such as drug trafficking, money laundering, and other illegal operations. Their actions often undermine the rule of law and can have a destabilizing effect on communities.\n\nC) Drug traffickers: Drug trafficking organizations can contribute to various problems in the United States, including addiction, violence, and the undermining of social institutions. They are known to operate across borders, smuggling illicit drugs into the country.\n\nD) China: China is a nation-state and not a nonstate actor.

This matches the statement in the question. \n\nOption (B) states that the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was about cutting conventional arms in Europe. This option does not match the statement in the question. \n\nOption (C) states that the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was the first accord to be rejected by the U.S. Senate.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of American exceptionalism and how the Cold War affected it.\n\nStep 1: Define American exceptionalism\nAmerican exceptionalism is the belief that the United States is a unique nation with a special destiny and a moral obligation to spread its political, economic, and cultural values to the rest of the world.\n\nStep 2: Understand the Cold War\nThe Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies. It lasted from the late 1940s to the early 1990s and was characterized by political, economic, and military competition, as well as ideological clashes, without direct armed conflict between the two superpowers.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the options\n(A) It ended the influence of American exceptionalism entirely:\nThis option suggests that the Cold War completely ended the influence of American exceptionalism. However, this seems unlikely as American exceptionalism persisted and continues to influence American foreign policy and self-perception.\n\n(B) Exceptionalism was enhanced by America's status as the 'leader of the free world':\nThis option suggests that America's role as the 'leader of the free world' during the Cold War enhanced American exceptionalism. It implies that the United States' opposition to the Soviet Union and its promotion of democracy and capitalism reinforced the idea that the U.S. was uniquely positioned to lead the world.\n\n(C) The extension of American power globally challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism:\nThis option suggests that the extension of American power globally during the Cold War created challenges to the core assumptions of American exceptionalism. It implies that the United States' involvement in international conflicts, covert operations, and alliances undermined the idea of America's moral superiority and unique destiny.\n\n(D) Both b and c:\nThis option suggests that both option (B) and option (C) are correct. It means that American exceptionalism was enhanced by America's status as the 'leader of the free world' while at the same time, the extension of American power globally challenged some of the core assumptions of exceptionalism.\n\nStep 4: Final answer\nAfter analyzing the options, it appears that option (D) is the most reasonable answer because it acknowledges that American exceptionalism was both enhanced and challenged by the Cold War.",

Roosevelt initially favoured an \"isolationist\" stance on the part of the US during the 1930s, we need to evaluate each option:\n\n(A) He believed that internal reform rather than international negotiation was the key to economic regeneration of the US: This option suggests that Roosevelt believed focusing on domestic reforms would be more effective in revitalizing the US economy. This reasoning aligns with an isolationist stance, as it prioritizes internal development over international engagement.\n\n(B) He believed that German domination of Europe would be in US interests: This option proposes that Roosevelt believed German dominance in Europe would benefit the US. However, this motivation is not typically associated with an isolationist stance. Supporting German domination would require engagement with international affairs, contradicting isolationism.\n\n(C) He always favored isolationism: This option suggests that Roosevelt consistently preferred an isolationist approach throughout his political career. While it is essential to consider his overall stance, it does not provide a specific reason for why he initially favored isolationism during the 1930s.\n\n(D) All of the above: This option claims that all of the previous statements are true. However, only option (A) relates to the initial favoring of isolationism. Option (B) does not align with isolationism, and option (C) does not provide a specific reason for the initial stance.\n\nUpon evaluation, it appears that option (A) is the most plausible explanation for why Franklin D. Roosevelt initially favored an \"isolationist\" stance on the part of the US during the 1930s.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the answer, we need to analyze each option and assess its alignment with the description of the 'New Populism'.\n\n(A) A strand of neo-isolationist sentiment:\nTo evaluate this option, we need to understand if the 'New Populism' reflects a neo-isolationist sentiment. However, the term \"populism\" typically refers to the political ideology that emphasizes the interests and opinions of the common people or the general population, which does not necessarily align with isolationism. Therefore, option A is unlikely to be the answer.\n\n(B) A strand of internationalist sentiment:\nTo evaluate this option, we need to assess if the 'New Populism' aligns with an internationalist sentiment. However, populism as a political ideology often emphasizes the concerns and goals of the domestic population, which can be contrary to an internationalist approach that prioritizes global cooperation and integration. Therefore, option B is unlikely to be the answer.\n\n(C) An expression of American cultural superiority:\nTo evaluate this option, we need to consider if the 'New Populism' can be seen as an expression of American cultural superiority. Populism tends to prioritize the interests of the common people over elites or established groups, so it is less likely to be explicit in expressing cultural superiority. Option C seems less aligned with the nature of populism, so it is unlikely to be the answer.\n\n(D) Increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making:\nTo evaluate this option, we need to consider if the 'New Populism' involves an increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making. Populism places great importance on the opinions and concerns of the general public, so it is plausible that the 'New Populism' would advocate for increased public involvement in foreign policy decisions. Therefore, option D seems to be the most fitting answer.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answer is (D)",
