            "model_answer": "To determine how many photons the detector will detect, we can multiply the number of photons sent into the detector (100) by the quantum efficiency (0.1). This will give us the average number of photons detected.\n\nAverage number of photons detected = 100 * 0.1 = 10\n\nTo calculate the root-mean-square (rms) deviation, we need to find the square root of the average squared deviation of the detected photons from the average.\n\nSince the quantum efficiency is 0.1, it means that there is a 10% chance for a photon to be detected. Therefore, the probability of a photon not being detected is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nThe distribution of photons being detected or not detected follows a binomial distribution with a success probability of 0.1 and a failure probability of 0.9. The rms deviation can be approximated using the formula:\n\nrms deviation = \u221a(n * p * q)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (100), p is the success probability (0.1), and q is the failure probability (0.9).\n\nrms deviation = \u221a(100 * 0.1 * 0.9)\nrms deviation \u2248 \u221a(9)\nrms deviation \u2248 3\n\nTherefore, the detector will detect photons an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.\n\nThe answer is (B).",

            "question": "White light is normally incident on a puddle of water (index of refraction 1.33). A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\n\n(A) 500 nm\n(B) 550 nm\n(C) 600 nm\n(D) 650 nm",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the most strongly reflected wavelength, we need to consider the interference between the incident and reflected light waves. When light waves from two different sources interfere, they can either constructively or destructively interfere depending on the phase relationship between them.\n\nIn this case, we have white light incident on the water-oil interface. White light consists of a range of wavelengths, each with its own color. The thickness of the oil layer is given as 500 nm.\n\nFirst, let's consider the reflection at the water-oil interface. When light waves encounter a boundary between two media with different refractive indices, part of the wave is reflected and part is transmitted. The amplitude of the reflected wave depends on the difference in refractive indices and the angle of incidence. Since the refractive index of oil (1.5) is greater than that of water (1.33), there will be a partial reflection at the water-oil interface.\n\nNext, let's consider the interference of the reflected light waves at the top of the oil layer. To determine whether the interference is constructive or destructive, we need to consider the path difference between the two reflected waves. The path difference depends on the thickness of the oil layer and the wavelength of the light.\n\nFor constructive interference to occur, the path difference must be an integer multiple of the wavelength. This means that the reflected waves must have a phase difference of 2\u03c0 or a multiple of 2\u03c0.\n\nFor destructive interference to occur, the path difference must be a half-integer multiple of the wavelength. This means that the reflected waves must have a phase difference of \u03c0 or a multiple of \u03c0.\n\nNow, to determine the most strongly reflected wavelength, we need to find the conditions for constructive interference. We can use the equation for the path difference: path difference = 2 * oil thickness * refractive index of oil.\n\nFor destructive interference, the path difference would be path difference = (2n + 1) * (wavelength/2), where n is an integer.\n\nFor constructive interference, the path difference would be path difference = n * wavelength, where n is an integer.\n\nBy comparing these two equations, we can see that the constructive interference condition has a smaller path difference (n * wavelength) than the destructive interference condition ((2n + 1) * (wavelength/2)). Therefore, the constructive interference condition will be satisfied for a wider range of wavelengths.\n\nSince white light consists of a range of wavelengths, it is expected that some of the wavelengths will meet the constructive interference condition. The most strongly reflected wavelength would be the one that results in the highest intensity of the reflected light.\n\nLet's calculate the different possible path differences for the given wavelengths: path difference = 2 * oil thickness * refractive index of oil.\n\nFor 500 nm: path difference = 2 * 500 nm * 1.5 = 1500 nm\nFor 550 nm: path difference = 2 * 500 nm * 1.5 = 1500 nm\nFor 600 nm: path difference = 2 * 500 nm * 1.5 = 1500 nm\nFor 650 nm: path difference = 2 * 500 nm * 1.5 = 1500 nm\n\nBased on these calculations, all the wavelengths (500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, 650 nm) result in the same path difference of 1500 nm. Therefore, they will all experience constructive interference and will be equally strongly reflected.\n\nAnswer: (A) 500 nm, (B) 550 nm, (C) 600 nm, and (D) 650 nm",

Excited states of an atom: Excited states refer to energy levels higher than the ground state of an atom. These states occur when one or more electrons in the atom have absorbed energy and moved to higher energy levels.\n\n2. Para- and ortho- states in the helium atom: In the helium atom, the two electrons can have either parallel (ortho-) or antiparallel (para-) spins. The spin of an electron refers to its intrinsic angular momentum. The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers, including spin. Therefore, the helium atom can have two possible states:\n   - Ortho- state: Both electrons have parallel spins.\n   - Para- state: Both electrons have antiparallel spins.\n\n3. Energy difference between ortho- and para- states: Experimentally, it has been observed that the ortho- state of the helium atom has lower energy than the corresponding para- state. This energy difference is known as the ortho-para energy splitting.\n\n4. Explanation: The Pauli exclusion principle can explain why the ortho- state has lower energy than the para- state. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons in an atom can occupy the same quantum state. In the case of the helium atom, the ortho- configuration allows the two electrons to have parallel spins, which results in their having different quantum states. This makes the ortho- state lower in energy than the para- state, where the spins are antiparallel.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) The Pauli exclusion principle",

The electron configuration of nitrogen can be written as 1s^2 2s^2 2p^3. \n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers.
