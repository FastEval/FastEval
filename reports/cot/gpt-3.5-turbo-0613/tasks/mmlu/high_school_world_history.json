By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

Europe saw value in investing in and improving gunpowder weapons due to the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during that time. In contrast, China faced threats from highly mobile steppe nomads, making the use of early gunpowder weapons impractical and leading them to focus on improving horse archer units instead.\n\nBased on this information, the argument in the passage is most closely related to the question of why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era. This is because it highlights one factor that contributed to Europe's military advancements \u2013 their development and utilization of gunpowder weapons \u2013 which gave them an advantage over non-Western powers, like China, during that time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.",

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",
