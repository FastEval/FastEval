            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct translation of \"murtis,\" we can analyze the given options.\n\n(A) Offerings: This translation refers to items that are presented or given as a gift or sacrifice in religious ceremonies. However, \"murtis\" does not directly translate to \"offerings.\"\n\n(B) Prayers: This translation implies the act of communicating with a deity or expressing one's spiritual beliefs, usually in the form of words or thoughts. While prayers can be associated with \"murtis\" in certain religious practices, it does not capture the full meaning of \"murtis.\"\n\n(C) Apparitions: This translation refers to the appearance of a person or thing that is not physically present. \"Murtis\" are not typically associated with apparitions, as they generally represent physical representations of deities.\n\n(D) Idols: This translation refers to objects that are worshipped as a representation or embodiment of a deity. \"Murtis\" are commonly referred to as \"idols\" in certain religious contexts.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the most suitable translation for \"murtis\" is (D) Idols.",

            "question": " Naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes are associated with which of the following?\n\n(A) Daoism\n(B) Yin-Yang School\n(C) Mengzi\n(D) Humanistic Buddhism",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the options and determine which one is most closely related to natural elements and processes.\n\nOption (A) Daoism:\nDaoism is a philosophical and spiritual tradition in China that emphasizes living in harmony with the Dao, which can be translated as \"the way\" or \"the natural order of things.\" Daoists seek to harmonize with nature and live in accordance with natural principles. Therefore, Daoism is associated with natural elements and processes.\n\nOption (B) Yin-Yang School:\nThe Yin-Yang School is closely related to Daoism. It is based on the concept of yin and yang, which represent complementary and opposing forces in the universe. Yin and yang are also associated with natural elements and processes. Therefore, the Yin-Yang School is associated with natural elements and processes.\n\nOption (C) Mengzi:\nMengzi, also known as Mencius, was a Chinese philosopher who focused on morality and the cultivation of virtues. While his teachings may touch on some aspects of nature, his main emphasis is on human behavior and moral development. Therefore, Mengzi is not primarily associated with natural elements and processes.\n\nOption (D) Humanistic Buddhism:\nHumanistic Buddhism is a modern movement within Buddhism that focuses on applying Buddhist teachings to benefit society. While Buddhism acknowledges and respects nature, its primary focus is on alleviating suffering and achieving enlightenment. Therefore, Humanistic Buddhism is not primarily associated with natural elements and processes.\n\nBased on our analysis, options (A) Daoism and (B) Yin-Yang School are the most closely associated with natural elements and processes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is either (A) or (B).\n\n(A) or (B)",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the answer, we need to go through each option and compare the dates to historical events related to the introduction of Buddhism in Japan.\n\nOption (A): 325 CE\nThis date is too early for the construction of the first Buddhist temple in Japan. Buddhism was officially introduced to Japan in the mid-6th century, so this option can be ruled out.\n\nOption (B): 119 CE\nThis date is also too early for the construction of the first Buddhist temple in Japan. As mentioned earlier, Buddhism arrived in Japan in the 6th century. Therefore, this option can be ruled out as well.\n\nOption (C): 451 CE\nWhile this date is closer to the introduction of Buddhism to Japan, it is still too early for the construction of the first Buddhist temple. Therefore, this option can be ruled out too.\n\nOption (D): 596 CE\nThis date aligns with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan. In 552 CE, the King of Baekje, a kingdom in Korea, sent a mission to Japan that included Buddhist monks and scriptures. This is considered the official introduction of Buddhism to Japan. Given that Buddhism arrived in Japan in 552 CE, it is plausible that the first Buddhist temple was constructed shortly after. Therefore, option (D) is the most likely answer.\n\nAnswer: (D)",
