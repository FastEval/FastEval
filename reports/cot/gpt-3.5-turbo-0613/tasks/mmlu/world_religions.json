            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which option is associated with naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes, we need to analyze each option and eliminate those that are unrelated.\n\n(A) Daoism: Daoism is a Chinese philosophy that emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao, which is often associated with nature. Therefore, naturalists who focused on natural elements and processes could be associated with Daoism.\n\n(B) Yin-Yang School: The Yin-Yang School is a philosophical framework that seeks to understand the world by analyzing the interplay of contrasting forces, such as light and dark, hot and cold, etc. While this concept has connections to natural phenomena, it may not directly align with naturalists who concentrate on natural elements and processes.\n\n(C) Mengzi: Mengzi, also known as Mencius, was a Chinese philosopher who focused on ethics and the development of an individual's moral character. While ethics and morals are important considerations in natural philosophy, Mengzi's work does not primarily emphasize natural elements and processes.\n\n(D) Humanistic Buddhism: Humanistic Buddhism is a modern form of Buddhism that places an emphasis on social engagement, humanitarianism, and self-cultivation. While Buddhism does acknowledge the interconnectedness of all things, it may not directly align with naturalists who concentrate on natural elements and processes.\n\nBased on our reasoning, the most relevant option associated with naturalists who concentrate on natural elements and processes is:\n\n(A) Daoism",
