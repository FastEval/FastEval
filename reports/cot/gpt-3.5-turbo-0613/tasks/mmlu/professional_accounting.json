            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the estimated yearly yield on your investment, we need to consider the income from renting the limousine and subtract the daily costs. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily income from renting the limousine. The car will be hired for an average of 2 hours per day, and the rental cost is $245 per hour. Therefore, the daily income can be calculated as 2 hours/day * $245/hour = $490/day.\n\nNext, let's determine the total yearly income from renting the limousine. We will assume that there are 365 days in a year, including any festivities and weekends. Therefore, the total yearly income can be calculated as $490/day * 365 days/year = $178,850/year.\n\nNow, let's calculate the daily costs. The daily costs are given as $50/day.\n\nTo calculate the yearly costs, we will multiply the daily costs by the number of days in a year. Since we assumed there are 365 days in a year, the yearly costs can be calculated as $50/day * 365 days/year = $18,250/year.\n\nTo calculate the estimated yearly yield on your investment, we subtract the yearly costs from the yearly income. Therefore, the estimated yearly yield can be calculated as $178,850/year - $18,250/year = $160,600/year.\n\nFinally, to determine the estimated yearly yield as a percentage of the initial investment ($98,000), we divide the estimated yearly yield by the initial investment and multiply by 100. Therefore, the estimated yearly yield as a percentage of the initial investment is $160,600/year / $98,000 * 100 = 164%.\n\nThe answer is (A) 164%.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which statement about audit sampling risks is correct for a nonissuer, we need to analyze each statement and decide if it accurately describes the concept.\n\nStatement (A) says that nonsampling risk arises when the auditor uses a sample for a substantive test and the conclusions may be different than if each item in the population was tested. This statement correctly describes nonsampling risk, which is the risk that arises from factors other than sampling, such as errors in performing audit procedures or misinterpretation of audit evidence.\n\nStatement (B) states that nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements. This statement is incorrect. Nonsampling risk does not specifically refer to the auditor's failure to recognize misstatements, but rather the risk of errors in performing audit procedures or reaching incorrect conclusions based on sampled data.\n\nStatement (C) claims that sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. This statement is incorrect. Sampling risk refers to the risk that the conclusions drawn from the sample may differ from the conclusions that would be reached if the entire population were tested. It does not directly relate to the uncertainty in applying audit procedures.\n\nStatement (D) states that sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. This statement correctly describes sampling risk. Sampling risk includes the risk that the selected audit procedures may not be effective in achieving the specific objective, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct statement about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer is:\n\n(D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.",

Let's examine each option to determine which one is correct:\n\n(A) Accounting Standards Updates: Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) are official pronouncements issued by the FASB to amend the Accounting Standards Codification. ASUs are used to update existing standards or provide new guidance in response to changes in the business environment or accounting practices. ASUs can contain changes to specific sections or topic areas within the codification.\n\n(B) Emerging Issues Task Force Releases: The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) is a consensus-based body established by the FASB. The EITF addresses emerging accounting issues and develops consensus on how to account for or disclose such issues. While EITF Releases provide guidance on specific emerging issues, they do not directly impact or change the Accounting Standards Codification.\n\n(C) Statements of Financial Accounting Standards: Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) were the primary source of authoritative accounting guidance issued by the FASB until 2009. However, the FASB discontinued the issuance of new SFAS and is now focused on issuing Accounting Standards Updates instead.\n\n(D) Staff Technical Bulletins: Staff Technical Bulletins (STBs) are interpretations and guidance documents issued by the FASB staff.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine how the error affected the bond carrying amount and retained earnings at June 30 year 12, we need to understand the differences between the straight-line method and the effective interest method of amortizing the premium.\n\nThe straight-line method evenly allocates the premium over the life of the bond. This means that the same amount of premium is amortized each period, regardless of the changing carrying amount of the bond.\n\nOn the other hand, the effective interest method uses a constant interest rate applied to the carrying amount of the bond each period. This results in a changing amount of premium being amortized each period, as the carrying amount decreases over time.\n\nSince Dean incorrectly used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method, the premium would have been amortized in equal amounts each period, regardless of the changing carrying amount of the bond. This means that the amortization expense would have been higher compared to the effective interest method.\n\nAs a result, the bond carrying amount would have been overstated at June 30 year 12. This is because the carrying amount would have been reduced by less than it should have been, leading to a higher reported carrying amount on the balance sheet.\n\nAdditionally, since the overstatement of the bond carrying amount directly affects the amortization expense, the retained earnings would have been understated at June 30 year 12. This is because the incorrect amortization expense would have resulted in lower reported net income, leading to lower retained earnings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Overstated Understated",

            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is incorrect regarding the old building, we need to understand the accounting treatment for assets held for sale and the implications of classifying the old building as such.\n\n1. It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale: When a company decides to sell an asset, it needs to be reclassified as an asset held for sale. This reclassification allows the asset to be presented separately in the financial statements, and its carrying amount is adjusted to the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.\n\n2. It will be classified as a current asset: If the old building is classified as an asset held for sale, it will be classified as a non-current asset, not a current asset. Current assets are expected to be consumed or converted into cash within one year or the normal operating cycle, whichever is longer. Since the company expects to complete the sale in four months, it will be classified as non-current.\n\n3. It will no longer be depreciated: Once an asset is classified as held for sale, it should no longer be depreciated. Instead, it is tested for impairment and carried at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Depreciation is not recognized since the asset is no longer expected to be used in the company's operations.\n\n4. It will be valued at historical cost: Assets held for sale are not valued at historical cost. As mentioned earlier, once an asset is held for sale, it needs to be adjusted to the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
