            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the estimated yearly yield on your investment, we will need to determine the total revenue generated and subtract the total costs.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the daily revenue:\nThe car is rented for 2 hours a day at $245 per hour, so the daily revenue is 2 hours * $245 = $490.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the annual revenue:\nAssuming you work every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends, the annual revenue is the daily revenue multiplied by the number of days in a year. There are 365 days in a year, so the annual revenue is $490 * 365 = $178,850.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the annual costs:\nThe daily costs are given as $50, so the annual costs are $50 * 365 = $18,250.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the annual yield:\nThe annual yield is the difference between the annual revenue and the annual costs, which is $178,850 - $18,250 = $160,600.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the yield percentage:\nTo determine the yield percentage, we divide the annual yield by the initial investment and multiply by 100. The initial investment is $98,000, so the yield percentage is ($160,600 / $98,000) * 100 = 163.67%.\n\nThe estimated yearly yield on your investment is approximately 163.67%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 164%.",

Assets: Since the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory, it would be counted as part of the inventory asset. Therefore, the omission of reporting the purchase would not affect the total assets. \n\n2. Liabilities: The purchase of merchandise on credit would typically result in an increase in accounts payable, which is a liability. However, since the purchase was not recorded, the accounts payable would not reflect the actual amount owed. Therefore, the omission of reporting the purchase would result in an understatement of liabilities.\n\nNow, let's output the answer:\n\n(D) Understated Understated",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which statement about audit sampling risks is correct for a nonissuer, we need to understand the definitions and concepts related to audit sampling risks.\n\n1. Nonsampling risk refers to the risk that the auditor reaches an incorrect conclusion for any reason not related to sampling. It can arise from various factors, such as audit planning, execution, or evaluation of results.\n\n2. Sampling risk is the risk that the sample selected for audit testing is not representative of the population and may lead to incorrect conclusions. It arises due to the inherent variability in the population being tested and the possibility of selecting a sample that does not fully represent the population.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n(A) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\nThis statement correctly describes nonsampling risk. When the auditor tests only a sample instead of examining each item in the population, there is a risk that the conclusions drawn from the sample may differ from what the auditor would have found if they had tested every item. This is because nonsampling risk can arise from factors other than sampling, such as errors in judgment or execution of procedures.\n \n(B) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\nThis statement is incorrect. Nonsampling risk is not specifically related to the auditor's ability to recognize misstatements. It refers to risks other than sampling that may affect the auditor's conclusion. Failure to recognize misstatements would fall under the concept of audit risk, which is beyond the scope of this question.\n\n(C) Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\nThis statement is incorrect. Sampling risk is not derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. It is derived from the inherent variability in the population being tested and the possibility of selecting a sample that does not fully represent the population.\n\n(D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\nThis statement is correct. Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. If the chosen audit procedures are not suitable or sufficient to address the specific objective, sampling risk increases as there may be a higher likelihood of reaching incorrect conclusions.\n\nBased on the evaluation above, the correct statement about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer is:\n\n(D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of subsequent events in auditing.\n\n1. Subsequent events refer to events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the date of the auditor's report.\n2. Auditors have a responsibility to evaluate subsequent events that may affect the financial statements and determine if they should be disclosed or adjusted.\n3. The three types of subsequent events are:\n   a. Type 1 events: Provide information about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date. These events require adjustment to the financial statements.\n   b. Type 2 events: Provide information about conditions that arose after the balance sheet date. These events require disclosure in the footnotes to the financial statements.\n   c. Type 3 events: Are events that require subsequent audit procedures and are not considered in the financial statements.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end.\n- This does not directly relate to subsequent events as it only focuses on inspecting inventory items. It may be part of other auditing procedures but not specific to subsequent events.\n\n(B) Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate.\n- Testing internal control activities is important for the overall audit process but does not specifically relate to subsequent events.\n\n(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\n- Reviewing cutoff bank statements for several months after the year-end can help identify any subsequent events related to bank transactions that may require adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements. This is a relevant procedure for subsequent events.\n\n(D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.\n- Comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited can help identify any subsequent events that may require adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.

            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the role of the FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) and how it makes changes to the Accounting Standards Codification.\n\n1. The FASB is responsible for establishing and improving financial accounting and reporting standards in the United States. They develop and issue these standards through a transparent and inclusive process.\n\n2. The Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) is the source of authoritative Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities.\n\n3. The FASB can make changes to the Accounting Standards Codification by issuing several types of pronouncements, including Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs), Emerging Issues Task Force Releases (EITFRs), Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS), and Staff Technical Bulletins (STBs).\n\n4. Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) are used by the FASB to communicate changes to the Accounting Standards Codification, including amendments, improvements, and simplifications to existing standards.\n\n5. Emerging Issues Task Force Releases (EITFRs) are issued by the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) to provide timely guidance on emerging accounting issues and to address areas where GAAP may be unclear or lacking.\n\n6. Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) were the primary source of GAAP prior to the establishment of the Accounting Standards Codification. While SFAS are still part of the Codification, they are not the primary method of making changes to it.\n\n7. Staff Technical Bulletins (STBs) are informative documents that provide interpretive guidance on specific accounting issues. However, they do not directly amend or change the Accounting Standards Codification.\n\nBased on the explanation above, the correct answer is (A) Accounting Standards Updates.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of premium bonds and the difference between the straight-line method and the effective interest method of amortization.\n\n1. Premium bonds: When a company issues bonds at a price higher than their face value, it is called a premium. The premium represents the excess amount paid by the bondholders and is amortized over the life of the bonds.\n\n2. Straight-line method: This method evenly distributes the premium over the life of the bonds. It assumes that the time value of money is constant throughout the bond's life.\n\n3. Effective interest method: This method allocates the premium based on the bond's carrying value (face value plus any unamortized premium) multiplied by a constant interest rate. It recognizes that the time value of money changes over time.\n\nNow, let's analyze how the error in using the straight-line method affects the bond carrying amount and retained earnings at June 30 year 12.\n\n1. Bond carrying amount: \n- If the straight-line method is used instead of the effective interest method, the amortization of the premium will be lower each period. \n- This means that the bond carrying amount (face value plus any unamortized premium) will be higher than it should be under the effective interest method.\n- Therefore, the bond carrying amount will be overstated.\n\n2. Retained earnings: \n- The error in amortizing the premium affects the interest expense recorded each period.\n- With the straight-line method, the interest expense will be lower each period compared to the effective interest method.\n- As a result, the company's net income will be higher in each period, leading to higher retained earnings.\n- Therefore, retained earnings will be overstated.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Overstated Understated",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is incorrect regarding the old building, we need to evaluate each statement step-by-step.\n\nStatement (A) states that the old building will be reclassified as an asset held for sale. When a company intends to sell an asset, it is reclassified as an asset held for sale. This statement is correct.\n\nStatement (B) states that the old building will be classified as a current asset. Current assets are those that are expected to be converted to cash or used up within one operating cycle or one year, whichever is longer. Since the company expects to complete the sale of the old building in four months, it can be considered as a current asset. This statement is correct.\n\nStatement (C) states that the old building will no longer be depreciated. Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life. Since the company plans to sell the old building, it will no longer use it to generate income and therefore, will no longer depreciate it. This statement is correct.\n\nStatement (D) states that the old building will be valued at historical cost. Historical cost is the original cost of an asset when it was acquired. When an asset is classified as held for sale, it is typically recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Therefore, it may not necessarily be valued at historical cost. This statement is incorrect.\n\nBased on our reasoning, the correct answer is (D).",
