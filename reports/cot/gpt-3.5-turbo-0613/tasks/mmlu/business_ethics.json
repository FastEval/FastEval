            "model_answer": "In the given sentence, we are talking about a type of currency that is becoming increasingly mainstream and has ethical implications. It is also mentioned that this currency is expensive, secure, and can be used for engaging in some activity.\n\nThe term \"cryptocurrencies\" matches the description given. They have gained popularity in recent years and have ethical implications related to their use. \n\nThe sentence also states that cryptocurrencies are expensive. In reality, some cryptocurrencies can be expensive to purchase, mine, or trade.\n\nAdditionally, the sentence mentions that cryptocurrencies are secure. Cryptocurrencies use advanced cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and protect user privacy.\n\nLastly, the sentence mentions that cryptocurrencies have been used to engage in some activities. One of those activities is financial crime, where cryptocurrencies have been used for money laundering, illegal transactions, and scams.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n(A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime\n(B) Traditional currency, Cheap, Unsecure, Charitable giving\n(C) Cryptocurrencies, Cheap, Secure, Financial crime\n(D) Traditional currency, Expensive, Unsecure, Charitable giving\n\nOption (C) fits the description given in the sentence. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

These obligations are usually outlined in individual contracts and employment laws.\n\nNow let's analyze the options given:\n\n(A) Employee rights: These are the entitlements of employees granted by employment laws, such as the right to fair treatment, equal opportunity, and a safe working environment. Employee rights do not represent the obligations workers have towards their employer.\n\n(B) Employee rights: This option is the same as option (A) and therefore does not represent the obligations workers have towards their employer.\n\n(C) Employer duties: These are the responsibilities or obligations that employers have towards their employees. It is not the answer we are looking for since the question asks about the obligations of workers towards their employer.\n\n(D) Employee duties: These are the actions and responsibilities that employees are expected to fulfill towards their employer.

It does not address the preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\n(B) Absenteeism: This term refers to the act of being absent from work, either intentionally or unintentionally. It also does not directly address the preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities, so it is not the correct answer.\n\n(C) Work-play balance: This term refers to the equilibrium or balance between the time spent on work-related activities and non-work-related activities, such as leisure, hobbies, and personal time. It directly addresses the preferred ratio between these activities, making it a viable option for the correct answer.\n\n(D) Work-life balance: This term is similar to the previous option, as it also refers to the equilibrium or balance between work-related activities and non-work-related activities, including personal and family life. While it addresses a broader spectrum, it still encompasses the preferred ratio between these activities, making it a valid option as well.\n\nAfter considering all the options and analyzing their descriptions, it is clear that both option (C) Work-play balance and option (D) Work-life balance address the preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which normative theory corporate profit maximization is most similar to, we need to analyze the principles and values underlying each theory. \n\n1. Hedonistic Utilitarianism: This theory holds that an action is morally right if it maximizes overall pleasure or happiness and minimizes pain or suffering. Corporate profit maximization does not necessarily prioritize pleasure or happiness of all individuals, but rather focuses on maximizing profits for the corporation or shareholders.\n\n2. Preference Utilitarianism: This theory considers an action to be morally right if it maximizes overall preference satisfaction or fulfillment of individuals. Corporate profit maximization may not align with this theory either, as it might not prioritize the fulfillment of individual preferences, but rather the financial success of the corporation.\n\n3. The Categorical Imperative: This ethical framework, proposed by Immanuel Kant, emphasizes the importance of universal principles and duties. It states that an action is morally right if it can be universally applied without contradiction. Corporate profit maximization does not align with this theory, as it does not focus on universal principles or duties but rather on the financial success of the corporation.\n\n4. Ethics of Care: This theory emphasizes the importance of caring relationships and interconnectedness. It values empathy, compassion, and the well-being of others. Corporate profit maximization does not align with the ethics of care, as it primarily focuses on the financial success and profitability of the corporation rather than the care and well-being of individuals.\n\nBased on the analysis of these normative theories, corporate profit maximization is most similar to (A) hedonistic utilitarianism.\nAnswer: (A)",

This aligns with Friedman's belief in shareholder primacy, which means that the main responsibility of a business is to maximize profits and shareholder wealth.\n\nOption B suggests that managers should act in ways that balance the interest of society and shareholders. While this viewpoint acknowledges the importance of considering societal interests, it does not align with Friedman's strict focus on shareholder value.\n\nOption C claims that the primary responsibility of organizations is to their employees. This perspective goes against Friedman's belief that the main responsibility is to shareholders rather than employees.\n\nOption D states that the primary responsibility of organizations is to their stakeholders. While this option is broad and includes various stakeholders, it does not specifically prioritize shareholder interests, which is a key aspect of Friedman's philosophy.\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can conclude that option (A) - The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders - accurately reflects Milton Friedman's belief on the sole responsibility of business.\n\n(A)",
