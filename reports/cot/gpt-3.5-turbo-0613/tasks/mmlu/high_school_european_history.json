According to the quotation, the various modes of worship in ancient Rome were seen differently by different groups. The people considered them all equally true, the philosopher considered them all equally false, and the magistrate considered them all equally useful.\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that religious worship in ancient Rome was not seen as a source of social tension and turmoil (option B), as there is no indication of conflict or disagreement between different religious groups. Additionally, there is no mention of the introduction of Christianity revolutionizing religious worship in ancient Rome (option D).\n\nThe quotation suggests that different modes of worship were considered equally true by the people. This implies that people had the freedom to choose and practice their own mode of worship, suggesting that religious worship was decentralized and varied with one's social position (option A).\n\nGiven all this information, we can conclude that Gibbon's interpretation can be summarized as: (A) In ancient Rome, religious worship was decentralized and tended to vary with one's social position.",

One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to carefully analyze the ideas expressed by Voltaire in the given quote and compare them to the characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals.\n\nIn the quote, Voltaire expresses his thoughts on the Lisbon earthquake and its devastating consequences. He points out the cruel nature of the event and the unimaginable suffering it caused. He also highlights the economic and social impact of the disaster, mentioning ruined families and businessmen. Voltaire further comments on the role of religion, specifically mentioning the palace of the Inquisition and expressing his hope that the inquisitors have been crushed, suggesting a critical view towards religious persecution.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\n(A) Many were accomplished scientists, who added important pieces to human understanding of the universe.\nWhile the Enlightenment period did see significant advancements in science, the quote from Voltaire does not directly reference scientific discoveries or the contributions of scientists. Therefore, we can eliminate this option.\n\n(B) They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets.\nThe quote does not mention any specific methods of communication or dissemination of ideas. Although it is possible that Enlightenment intellectuals utilized such methods, there is no direct evidence in the quote to support this. Therefore, we can eliminate this option as well.\n\n(C) Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational man.\nThe quote does not explicitly state that Voltaire rejects religion altogether or adopts atheism as his credo. While he does criticize religious persecution and expresses a negative view towards the Inquisition, this does not necessarily mean he rejected religion entirely. Therefore, we can eliminate this option.\n\n(D) Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\nThis option aligns closely with the ideas expressed by Voltaire in the quote. He highlights the suffering caused by natural disasters and questions the role of religion, suggesting a need for greater tolerance and understanding. This reflects a belief in a more objective and rational approach to social and cultural issues. Therefore, this is the most accurate characteristic of Enlightenment intellectuals based on the given quote.\n\nHence, the answer is: (D)",

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him.

The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly.

When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.
