An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim. Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(B) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n(D) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the P-value of this test, we need to compare the sample mean to the claimed weight of 300 milligrams. We can use a t-test to do this. \n\n1) First, we calculate the sample mean: \nMean = (299 + 300 + 305 + 302 + 299 + 301 + 303) / 7 = 301.29\n\n2) Next, we calculate the sample standard deviation: \nStandard Deviation = sqrt(((299-301.29)^2 + (300-301.29)^2 + (305-301.29)^2 + (302-301.29)^2 + (299-301.29)^2 + (301-301.29)^2 + (303-301.29)^2) / (7-1)) = 2.02\n\n3) We can then calculate the t-value using the formula:\nt = (Sample Mean - Claimed Mean) / (Sample Standard Deviation / sqrt(Sample Size))\nt = (301.29 - 300) / (2.02 / sqrt(7)) = 1.535\n\n4) Finally, we can use the t-value to determine the P-value using the t-distribution table or a statistical software. Since we are conducting a two-tailed test, we need to find the probability of getting a t-value greater than 1.535 or less than -1.535. This gives us the P-value.\n\nNow, we can output the answer: \n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7",

A z-score represents the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean.\n\nThe formula to find the z-score is:\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere x is the data point, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nSince we want to find the time interval associated with the 100,000th rider, we need to find the z-score that corresponds to the 100,000th rider's waiting time. \n\nTo find the z-score, we can rearrange the formula:\nx = z * \u03c3 + \u03bc\n\nSubstituting in the values:\nx = z * 10 + 35\n\nNext, we need to find the z-score that corresponds to the 50,000th rider, as this will give us the lower bound of the time interval.\n\nUsing the same formula:\nx = z * 10 + 35\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding z-scores for these riders. We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find these z-scores.\n\nLooking up the z-scores:\nFor the 100,000th rider, the z-score is approximately 1.28\nFor the 50,000th rider, the z-score is approximately -0.68\n\nNow, we can use these z-scores to find the waiting times associated with these riders.\n\nFor the 100,000th rider:\nx = 1.28 * 10 + 35 = 12.8 + 35 = 47.8 minutes\n\nFor the 50,000th rider:\nx = -0.68 * 10 + 35 = -6.8 + 35 = 28.2 minutes\n\nThe shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is from 28.2 to 47.8 minutes.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) 25.3 to 44.7 minutes.",

The significance level (or alpha) determines the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis. A lower alpha value (e.g., 5%) requires stronger evidence to reject the null hypothesis compared to a higher alpha value (e.g., 10%).

The significance level (alpha) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.

To determine if this statement is correct, we need to understand the difference between observational studies and experiments. In an observational study, researchers observe and collect data on subjects without assigning treatments or interventions.

Blocking is a technique used in experimental design to control for potential confounding variables.

Therefore, we cannot determine if this study is poorly designed based on the lack of blocking. Therefore, statement (B) is incorrect.\n\nStep 7: Statement (C) states that the placebo effect is irrelevant in this type of study.

In this design, each subject serves as their own control by being measured or observed multiple times under different conditions. In this study, the subjects' reaction time was measured before and after drinking alcohol.
