This suggests that managing a large matrix can be inconvenient.\n(B) The access matrix may not be capable of expressing complex protection requirements. This indicates a limitation in its ability to handle complex scenarios.\n(C) If deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable, it means that it is impossible to determine if a process should have access to a resource based on the access matrix alone.\n(D) The inability to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself suggests a limitation in assigning permissions for modifying the matrix.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate each difficulty mentioned and determine the correct answer.\n\nOut of the given difficulties, (A), (B), and (D) can be considered valid challenges associated with the access matrix approach. However, difficulty (C), stating that deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable, represents a fundamental problem that goes beyond being a difficulty. It implies that the access matrix approach may not be effective or reliable.\n\nStep 5: Output the correct answer.\n\nThe access matrix approach to protection has the difficulty that deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable.

In a segmented memory system, the memory is divided into segments of varying sizes, with each segment assigned a specific purpose or function. So, statement I is true.\n\nII. It permits implementation of virtual memory.\nVirtual memory is a memory management technique that allows the execution of programs that are larger than the physical memory. It uses a combination of RAM and secondary storage (such as hard drives) to create an illusion of a much larger memory. Segmented memory systems alone do not inherently support virtual memory. They would require additional mechanisms and techniques, such as paging or swapping, to implement virtual memory. So, statement II is false.\n\nIII. It suffers from internal fragmentation.\nInternal fragmentation occurs when memory is allocated in fixed-size blocks or segments, and the allocated space is larger than the actual data that needs to be stored. In a purely segmented memory system, the segments are of equal size. This means that if a segment is allocated and only a portion of it is used, the remaining memory within the segment will be wasted, resulting in internal fragmentation.
