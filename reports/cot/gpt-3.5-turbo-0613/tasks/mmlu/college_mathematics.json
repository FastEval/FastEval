The length of x can vary from 0 to 10.\n\nIf x is 0, then it is impossible for the three smaller segments to form a triangle, as one of the segments would have a length of 0. Similarly, if x is equal to 10, one of the segments would have a length of 10, which doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where x is between 0 and 10, exclusive. In this case, we can choose any value for x, and then the lengths of the other two segments should be such that their sum is greater than x.\n\nTo determine the valid range of lengths for the other two segments, we can use the triangle inequality, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nFor example, if x is 4, then the two remaining segments should have lengths that sum to more than 4. Since both segments have positive lengths, the smallest sum we can achieve is 1 + 1 = 2, while the largest sum is 9 + 9 = 18. Therefore, the valid range of lengths for the other two segments is 2 to 18.\n\nIt's important to note that the probability of choosing any specific length for x within the range of 0 to 10 is the same. So, to find the probability that the three smaller segments could form the sides of a triangle, we need to calculate the ratio of the valid range of lengths (2 to 18) to the total possible range for x (0 to 10).\n\nThe total possible range for x is 10 - 0 = 10. The valid range for the other two segments is 18 - 2 = 16.\n\nTherefore, the probability is given by: 16 / 10.\n\nSimplifying, we find that the probability is 8/5.\n\nThe answer is therefore (C) 25%.",

However, from the given information, we only know that P^2 = P. There is no indication that an inverse transformation exists. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nStatement II: P is diagonalizable.\nTo check if P is diagonalizable, we need to investigate whether it has a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors. \nLet v be an eigenvector of P with eigenvalue \u03bb. We have P(v) = \u03bbv. \nNow, consider P(P(v)) = P\u00b2(v) = P(v) = \u03bbv. Since P\u00b2 = P, this simplifies to P(v) = \u03bbv. \nThis shows that every eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue \u03bb is also an eigenvector of P\u00b2 (with the same eigenvalue \u03bb). \nTherefore, in order for P to be diagonalizable, the eigenvalues of P\u00b2 (which is P) must be the same as the eigenvalues of P. In other words, all eigenvalues of P must be either 0 or 1. \nHowever, it is possible for P to have non-zero eigenvalues (for example, if P is the projection onto a subspace of V), so statement II is not necessarily true.\n\nStatement III: P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation.\nFrom statement II, we know that all eigenvalues of P must be either 0 or 1. \nConsider a non-zero eigenvalue \u03bb of P. Since P(v) = \u03bbv for some non-zero vector v, and P\u00b2(v) = P(v) = \u03bbv, it follows that P(\u03bbv) = \u03bb\u00b2v = \u03bbv. \nTherefore, if \u03bb is a non-zero eigenvalue, we have P(\u03bbv) = P(v). This implies that P applied to any scalar multiple of an eigenvector with non-zero eigenvalue \u03bb is equal to P applied to the eigenvector itself. \nFrom this, we can conclude that if P has a non-zero eigenvalue, it must be the identity transformation on the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors with that eigenvalue. \nAdditionally, if the eigenvalue is 0, then P is the zero transformation on the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors with that eigenvalue. \nTherefore, statement III is true.\n\nBased on our analysis, the only statement that must be true is statement III. \nThe answer is (D) III only.",
