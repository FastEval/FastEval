We want to find the number of times this function intersects the x-axis in the interval [0, 1].\n\nStep 2: Check the behavior of the function at the endpoints of the interval [0, 1]. \n   - At x = 0, f(0) = e^0 + 0 - 2 = 1 + 0 - 2 = -1.\n   - At x = 1, f(1) = e^1 + 1 - 2 = e + 1 - 2 = e - 1 (since e^1 = e).\n\nStep 3: Analyze the behavior of the function in the interval (0, 1). Since f(x) is a continuous function and e^x is always positive, the function e^x + x - 2 is strictly increasing in the interval (0, 1). Additionally, f(0) < 0 and f(1) > 0, which means the function crosses the x-axis exactly once in the interval (0, 1).\n\nStep 4: Summarize the findings:\n   - f(x) < 0 at x = 0,\n   - f(x) > 0 at x = 1,\n   - f(x) has exactly one x-intercept in the interval (0, 1).\n\nBased on the analysis, the number of real solutions of the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0 in the interval [0, 1] is k = 1.\n\nTo find the number of real solutions that are not in [0, 1], we need to check the behavior of the function outside of the interval [0, 1].\n\nStep 5: Check the behavior of the function at x = 0 and x = 1.\n   - At x = 0, f(0) = -1, which is not equal to 0.\n   - At x = 1, f(1) = e - 1, which is not equal to 0.\n\nStep 6: Analyze the behavior of the function outside of the interval [0, 1]. Since f(x) is a continuous function, we can observe that f(x) < 0 for x < 0 and f(x) > 0 for x > 1. This means that there are no real solutions outside of the interval [0, 1].\n\nStep 7: Summarize the findings:\n   - f(x) < 0 for x < 0,\n   - f(x) > 0 for x > 1,\n   - No real solutions outside of the interval [0, 1].\n\nBased on the analysis, the number of real solutions of the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0 that are not in [0, 1] is n = 0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) k = 1 and n = 0.",

This is because the derivative of a constant polynomial is always the zero polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the null space n of the operator D consists of only constant polynomials in P.\n\nTo determine the dimension of the null space n, we need to find the number of linearly independent constant polynomials in P.

The range r consists of all polynomials in P that are the derivatives of other polynomials in P.\n\nLet's consider the highest degree term in a polynomial p(x) in P. When we take the derivative p'(x), the highest degree term will decrease by one. Therefore, the highest degree term in p(x) cannot be in the range r since it will be missing in p'(x). \n\nFor a polynomial in P to be in the range r, the highest degree term must be missing, but any lower degree terms can be present.

If P has an inverse, it means there exists a linear transformation Q such that P\u2218Q = Q\u2218P = I (where I is the identity transformation). If P has an inverse, we would have P\u2218P^-1 = P^-1\u2218P = I (where P^-1 is the inverse of P). \n\nTo see if P has an inverse from P^2 = P, we can multiply both sides by P^-1:\nP^2\u2218P^-1 = P\u2218P^-1\nP\u2218P = P\u2218P^-1\nSince P\u2218P = P, we can conclude that P = P^-1 if P has an inverse. \n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that P has an inverse. P could be the zero transformation, where P(v) = 0 for all vectors v in V. In this case, there is no linear transformation Q such that P\u2218Q = Q\u2218P = I. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nStatement II: P is diagonalizable.\nA linear transformation is diagonalizable if there exists a basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of P. To determine if P is diagonalizable, we need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n\nLet \u03bb be an eigenvalue of P and v be the corresponding eigenvector. By definition, P(v) = \u03bbv. Applying P to both sides, we get P\u2218P(v) = P(\u03bbv), which simplifies to P^2(v) = \u03bbP(v). Since P^2 = P, we have P(v) = \u03bbP(v). \nIf \u03bb is not equal to 0, we can divide both sides by \u03bb to get P(v)/\u03bb = P(v). Since P(v) cannot be zero (unless v is the zero vector), this means that \u03bb = 1. Therefore, the only possible eigenvalue of P is 1.\n\nNow, for an eigenvector v and eigenvalue \u03bb = 1, we have P(v) = v.

In this case, P^2 = P is also true.\n\nTherefore, P could be either the identity transformation or the zero transformation. Statement III is true.\n\nTo summarize:\nI. P is invertible. (False)\nII.
