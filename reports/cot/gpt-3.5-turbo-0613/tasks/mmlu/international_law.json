            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which State ordinarily exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels, we need to consider the principles of international law and relevant conventions.\n\n1. Coastal State: The coastal State refers to the State that has sovereignty over the waters adjacent to its coast. This State generally has jurisdiction over crimes committed within its territorial sea (up to 12 nautical miles from its coast) and may also have limited jurisdiction over crimes committed in its exclusive economic zone (up to 200 nautical miles from its coast). However, crimes committed on board vessels in international waters are generally not under the jurisdiction of the coastal State. So, the answer is not (A) The coastal State.\n\n2. Flag State: The flag State refers to the State whose flag the vessel is flying. According to the principle of flag State jurisdiction, the flag State has jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels flying its flag, regardless of the location of the vessel. This principle is widely recognized in international law and allows the flag State to exercise control over its vessels and ensure the enforcement of law and order on board. Therefore, the answer is (B) The flag State.\n\n3. All States enjoy such jurisdiction: This option is incorrect because it implies that all States have jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels, which is not the case.\n\n4. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea: The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) is a specialized international tribunal established to resolve disputes related to the interpretation and application of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Although ITLOS has jurisdiction to hear cases related to crimes committed on board vessels, it does not exercise ordinary jurisdiction over such crimes. The primary responsibility for exercising jurisdiction lies with the flag State and, in some cases, the coastal State. Thus, the answer is not (D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct answer is (B) The flag State.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the meaning of justiciability, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders: This option suggests that justiciability relates to the ability of individuals or groups to enforce their rights. While this is related to the concept of justiciability, it does not capture the full meaning.\n\n(B) Justiciability refers to the just nature or cause of a particular right: This option suggests that justiciability is about determining whether a right is just or has a valid cause. This interpretation is not accurate, as justiciability focuses more on the legal aspects rather than the innate justice of a right.\n\n(C) Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular right conforms to principles of justice: This option suggests that justiciability pertains to the evaluation made by courts to determine if the failure to enforce a specific right aligns with principles of justice. This interpretation is more aligned with the concept of justiciability.\n\n(D) Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular right: This option suggests that justiciability is about the responsibility of the State to enforce a particular right. While this may be a factor in justiciability, it does not encompass the full meaning.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (C) provides the most accurate description of justiciability, as it captures the idea of courts assessing the non-enforcement of a right in relation to principles of justice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question step-by-step, we need to understand the concepts of Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention and then compare them to identify their differences. \n\n1. Responsibility to Protect (R2P): R2P is a principle endorsed by the United Nations in 2005 that aims to prevent and react to genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. It states that the primary responsibility to protect its population lies with the State itself, but if a State is unable or unwilling to protect its population, the international community has a responsibility to intervene.\n\n2. Humanitarian intervention: Humanitarian intervention refers to the use of military force or other measures by external actors to prevent or stop human rights abuses, even without the consent of the State in question. It is often motivated by the protection of civilians and the prevention of mass atrocities.\n\nNow, let's compare R2P and humanitarian intervention based on the given options:\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention: This option suggests that R2P and humanitarian intervention have no significant differences. However, this contradicts the fact that R2P is a broader concept that includes a range of responses beyond military intervention.\n\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress: This option suggests that R2P requires the State in distress to request assistance. However, this is not accurate because R2P acknowledges that States might be unable or unwilling to protect their population, and in such cases, the international community has a responsibility to intervene.\n\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis: This option highlights two important differences. R2P involves the input of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which brings together various countries to decide on actions, making it a more inclusive process than unilateral humanitarian intervention. Additionally, R2P's primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis, suggesting a broader framework that focuses on prevention rather than just intervention.\n\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not: This option distinguishes R2P by suggesting that it always involves armed force, while humanitarian intervention may not. However, this is incorrect because R2P encompasses a range of possible responses, including diplomatic, economic, and military measures. Not every R2P intervention involves armed force.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that option (C) is the correct answer. R2P is different from humanitarian intervention because it requires some UNSC input, making it less arbitrary and more inclusive in the decision-making process. Additionally, its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis, emphasizing a preventive approach rather than just intervention.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "We need to analyze the options and determine which one accurately describes the 'Lotus principle'. \n\nOption (A) states that the Lotus principle is that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed' or 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law'. This suggests that unless an action is specifically prohibited, it is permitted in international law.\n\nOption (B) states that the Lotus principle is that States are free to choose the Court that they will submit their disputes. This implies that States have the autonomy to select the court in which they will resolve their disputes.\n\nOption (C) states that the Lotus principle is that States are not prohibited to assert their enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas. This suggests that States can exercise their jurisdiction on the high seas unless explicitly prohibited.\n\nOption (D) states that the Lotus principle is that customary law derives from the combination of State practice and opinio juris. This implies that customary law is formed based on the combination of consistent State practice and a sense of legal obligation (opinio juris).\n\nBased on the analysis of the options, we can conclude that option (C) accurately describes the Lotus principle, as it indicates that States are not prohibited from asserting their enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

However, this is not accurate as the UK Constitution is more than just the power of the sovereign.\n\n(B) The UK Constitution gives the judiciary the power to overturn acts of parliament: This statement implies that the judiciary has the authority to overturn acts of parliament. While the judiciary in the UK does have the power of judicial review, they cannot completely overturn acts of parliament. The principle of parliamentary sovereignty limits the ability of the judiciary to strike down laws enacted by parliament.\n\n(C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources: This statement accurately describes the nature of the UK Constitution. Unlike many other countries, the UK does not have a single, written constitution. Instead, the UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in various sources such as statutes, case law, conventions, and treaties.\n\n(D) The UK Constitution is based on a Bill of Rights: This statement suggests that the UK Constitution is primarily built upon a Bill of Rights. However, while the UK does have a Bill of Rights, namely the Human Rights Act 1998, it is not the sole foundation of the UK Constitution.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (C) is the most accurate description of the UK Constitution.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's break down the options one by one:\n\nOption (A): It states that the obligation of peaceful settlement of disputes is an obligation of result, meaning that States are strictly obligated to resolve their disputes as soon as possible. This option implies that there is a mandatory requirement to achieve a resolution. However, this may not be accurate as there are different approaches to dispute settlement in international law.\n\nOption (B): This option suggests that the obligation is one of conduct, meaning that States are obligated to make efforts to resolve their disputes peacefully. However, it does not imply a strict requirement to actually resolve the disputes. This approach acknowledges that some disputes may not be fully resolved, but emphasizes the importance of peaceful means in attempting to resolve them.\n\nOption (C): This option suggests that the obligation of peaceful settlement of disputes is a peremptory norm of international law. A peremptory norm is a fundamental principle that cannot be derogated from and is binding on all States. This option also states that all States have a legal interest in safeguarding the application of this norm in any given dispute.\n\nOption (D): This option states that the obligation of peaceful settlement of disputes solely concerns international courts and tribunals. This is not accurate as peaceful settlement of disputes goes beyond just international courts and tribunals and includes other peaceful means such as negotiation, mediation, and diplomatic efforts.\n\nBased on our reasoning, it is evident that option (B) is the correct answer. It accurately describes the obligation of peaceful settlement of disputes as an obligation of conduct, where States are obligated to make efforts to resolve their disputes through peaceful means, but it does not impose a strict requirement to actually resolve the disputes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",
