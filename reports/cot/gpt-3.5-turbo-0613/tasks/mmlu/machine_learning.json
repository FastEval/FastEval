In the context of estimators, a smaller variance indicates that the estimator's predicted values are generally close to the true values.\n\n- Unbiased estimator: An estimator is unbiased if, on average, it accurately estimates the true value of the population parameter.\n\nNow, to analyze the statement, we need to consider other types of estimators and see if any of them have smaller variances than linear regression. Based on statistical theory, it is known that linear regression is just one type of estimator among many others.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is False.\n\nStatement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\n\nTo determine the validity of this statement, we need to understand what AdaBoost is and how it assigns coefficients to classifiers.\n\n- AdaBoost: AdaBoost is a machine learning algorithm that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. The process involves assigning weights or coefficients to each weak classifier to determine their importance in the final model.\n\nBased on the definition of AdaBoost, it is reasonable to assume that the coefficients assigned to the classifiers should be non-negative. Since coefficients represent the importance or weight of each classifier, having negative coefficients would go against the logic of boosting the weak classifiers' performance.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is True.\n\nBased on the analysis of each statement, the answer is (C) True, False.",

RoBERTa is a variant of BERT that was introduced in 2019. It was trained on a larger corpus compared to the original BERT model. Specifically, BERT was pretrained on a corpus of 3.3 billion words, whereas RoBERTa was pretrained on a corpus of 16GB text data, which is roughly 10 times larger.\n\nStatement 2: ResNeXts in 2018 usually used tanh activation functions.\n\nThis statement is false. ResNeXt is a neural network architecture that was introduced in 2017 as an extension of the ResNet architecture. ResNeXt models typically utilize rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions rather than tanh activation functions.

They can indeed give a probability distribution over the possible labels given an input example. However, it is important to note that SVMs do not produce these probabilities directly. Instead, they use a method called Platt scaling or logistic regression to convert the raw SVM outputs into probabilities. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate Statement 2\nSupport vectors are the data points which lie closest to the decision boundary of an SVM. They are crucial in defining the decision boundary and determining the classification results. The choice of kernel can have a significant impact on the SVM's decision boundary. A linear kernel results in a linear decision boundary, while higher-order polynomial kernels can produce more complex decision boundaries. Given this, it is reasonable to expect that the support vectors may change as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels.

Convolutional networks: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are specifically designed for image recognition and classification tasks. They are well-suited for handling high-dimensional data, such as high-resolution images. CNNs utilize convolutional layers to detect local features, pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions, and fully connected layers for classification. CNNs have achieved great success in image classification tasks, making them a strong contender.\n\n2. Graph networks: Graph networks are mainly used for modeling and analyzing structured data that can be represented as graphs. While some image analysis tasks may involve graph-based representations, high-resolution images are typically better suited for architectures that directly handle the pixel-based structures. Graph networks may not be the most suitable choice for classifying high-resolution images.\n\n3. Fully connected networks: Fully connected networks, or multi-layer perceptrons, consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) where each node is connected to every node in the previous and following layers. Although fully connected networks can model complex relationships between input and output, they may not be well-suited for processing high-resolution images. The large number of parameters and the lack of spatial awareness in fully connected networks make them less efficient and effective compared to other architectures tailored for image classification.\n\n4. RBF networks: Radial basis function (RBF) networks use radial basis functions as activation functions. While RBF networks have been successfully used in various applications, such as function approximation and pattern recognition, they may not be specifically designed for high-resolution image classification. RBF networks typically face challenges in handling the high dimensionality and complexity of image data, making them less suitable compared to convolutional networks.\n\nBased on the considerations above, it can be determined that the best architecture for classifying high-resolution images is (A) convolutional networks.\n\n(A)",

In each iteration of the EM algorithm, there are two main steps: the expectation (E) step and the maximization (M) step.\n\nIn the E step, a posterior distribution or probability values are computed for the missing or hidden data given the current parameter estimates. These probabilities are also known as the responsibilities.\n\nIn the M step, the parameter estimates are updated by maximizing the expected complete data log-likelihood, taking into account the computed responsibilities from the E step. This update leads to an increase in the log-likelihood.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the EM algorithm can sometimes converge to a local maximum instead of the global maximum of the log-likelihood. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that the log-likelihood will always increase through successive iterations of the EM algorithm.\n\nStatement 1 is False.\n\nStatement 2: One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment.\n\nQ-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that aims to learn an optimal policy for an agent to take actions in an environment to maximize expected rewards. It is a model-free algorithm, meaning that it does not require prior knowledge of the environment dynamics.\n\nQ-learning uses a Q-value table or function to estimate the expected utility or value of taking different actions in different states. The Q-value table is updated through an iterative process based on the observed rewards and actions.\n\nOne of the advantages of Q-learning is that it does not require knowledge of the dynamics of the environment.

If the cost function is a function of D parameters, then the gradient vector g will have D elements. Each element of the gradient vector represents the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to a specific parameter.\n\nSince each parameter requires an update based on its corresponding partial derivative, the time complexity of one gradient descent update is proportional to the number of parameters, D.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) O(D).",
