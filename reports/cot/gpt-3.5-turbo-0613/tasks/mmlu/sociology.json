            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options one by one and eliminate the ones that are not supported by mass-society theory.\n\nOption (A) claims that the content of the media is determined by market forces. This is not directly supported by mass-society theory, as it focuses more on the impact of media on society rather than the market forces that determine media content.\n\nOption (B) suggests that the subordinate classes are dominated by the ideology of the ruling class. This aligns with the central idea of mass-society theory, which argues that the media perpetuate the dominant ideology to maintain the existing power structure.\n\nOption (C) states that the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers. This idea resonates with mass-society theory, as it posits that the media have the power to shape and control public opinion, making the masses passive recipients of information.\n\nOption (D) argues that audiences make selective interpretations of media messages. While this statement is true to some extent, it does not capture the essence of mass-society theory, which focuses more on the media's influence on the masses rather than the interpretation by the audiences.\n\nBased on the analysis, we can see that options (B) and (C) are more aligned with mass-society theory. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) and (C).",

            "model_answer": "To determine the answer to this question, we need to analyze each option and see which one aligns with the ecological approach to urban sociology.\n\n(A) The option talks about how social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources. This aligns with the ecological approach as it focuses on understanding how different social groups interact and adapt to their urban environment.\n\n(B) The option mentions wildlife and natural habitats on the edges of the city. While this is related to ecology, it is not directly addressing the sociological aspect of urban ecology.\n\n(C) The option discusses collective protests about environmental issues. While this is important in understanding environmental sociology, it does not specifically address the ecological approach to urban sociology.\n\n(D) The option focuses on how men and women use the city's public spaces differently. While this is an important aspect to study in sociology, it does not specifically address the ecological approach.\n\nAnalyzing the options, it becomes clear that option (A) is the only one that directly aligns with the ecological approach to urban sociology.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze each option and determine which one aligns with Becker's proclamation about cannabis use.\n\nOption A states that cannabis use was increasing throughout all sections of youth in the 1970s. This option is plausible, as the 1970s saw a significant increase in cannabis use, especially among young people. However, there is no specific mention of this in the question, so we cannot definitively say that this is Becker's proclamation.\n\nOption B suggests that cannabis use is learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career. This option aligns with Becker's labeling theory, which argues that deviance is a result of the societal reaction to certain behaviors. According to Becker, cannabis use can be learned and embraced through social interactions and the adoption of a deviant identity. This option seems promising, but we need to evaluate the other two options before making a final decision.\n\nOption C states that cannabis use is a dangerous pastime that young people should not be allowed to pursue. This option does not align with Becker's views on cannabis use. Becker's perspective focuses on the social construction of deviance and challenges the idea of labeling cannabis use as inherently dangerous or wrong. He argues that societal reactions and stigmatization play a significant role in shaping the consequences of cannabis use.\n\nOption D suggests that cannabis use is not as enjoyable as other sociologists had suggested. This option does not align with Becker's views either. Becker does not primarily focus on the subjective enjoyment of cannabis use but rather on the social processes and reactions associated with it.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the most accurate portrayal of Becker's proclamation regarding cannabis use. Becker's theory of deviance and labeling emphasizes the social processes and career that individuals undertake to embrace cannabis use, aligning with option B.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze each statement one by one and determine if it accurately describes the middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century.\n\nStatement (A) claims that the middle classes were an urban set involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations. This statement suggests that the middle classes were actively engaged in their communities and participated in various organizations. \n\nStatement (B) suggests that the middle classes were too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness. This means that due to their diversity in terms of occupation, background, and other factors, they did not have a strong awareness or identity as a unified social class.\n\nStatement (C) states that the middle classes were often involved in 'white collar' work. This refers to jobs that are typically office-based and do not involve manual labor, such as clerical work, management positions, or professional occupations.\n\nNow, we need to determine if all of these statements are true.\n\nBased on historical knowledge, the middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century did indeed consist of urban individuals involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations. This can be seen in the emergence of social clubs, charities, and other community organizations during this time.\n\nThe statement about the middle classes being too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness is also valid. The middle classes consisted of a wide range of occupations and backgrounds, which made it challenging for them to form a strong sense of shared identity or awareness as a distinct social class.\n\nLastly, the statement mentioning the middle classes being frequently involved in 'white collar' work is accurate. The growth of administrative and managerial roles, along with the expansion of professional occupations, provided opportunities for the middle classes to engage in non-manual labor.\n\nConsidering all three statements are accurate, the answer is:\n\n(D) all of the above",

With the advancement of technology, companies and individuals can collect, store, and share personal data more easily.\n\nOption (B): Technological forms of surveillance can potentially contribute to reducing prison overcrowding by the use of electronic tagging. By monitoring and tracking individuals through electronic devices, authorities can allow some offenders to serve their sentence outside of prison, thus reducing the inmate population.\n\nOption (C): Technological forms of surveillance also enable employers to monitor employees' activities at work. Tools such as computer monitoring software, GPS tracking, and security cameras allow employers to supervise employee behavior and productivity.\n\nBased on the above analysis, it can be concluded that all of the given options are true.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the concept of gemeinschaft developed by Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies and compare it to the other options presented.\n\n1. First, let's understand what gemeinschaft means. In sociology, gemeinschaft refers to a type of social organization characterized by close-knit relationships, a sense of community, and shared norms and values. It is often associated with traditional, rural societies.\n\n2. Now, let's examine the options provided:\n   (A) Organic solidarity: This concept, developed by \u00c9mile Durkheim, refers to social cohesion based on the interdependence between individuals in more complex, modern societies. It is characterized by a division of labor and a reliance on each other's specialized skills.\n   (B) Mechanical solidarity: Also developed by Durkheim, this concept refers to social cohesion based on the similarity and sameness of individuals in simpler, traditional societies. It is characterized by shared beliefs, values, and common practices.\n   (C) Gesellschaft: This concept, also developed by T\u00f6nnies, refers to a type of social organization characterized by impersonal relationships, individualism, and a focus on individual goals. It is often associated with modern, urban societies.\n   (D) Anomie: This concept, also developed by Durkheim, refers to a state of normlessness or feeling disconnected from societal norms and values in periods of rapid social change or individualism.\n\n3. Given that gemeinschaft is associated with traditional, rural societies and is characterized by close-knit relationships and shared norms and values, it is most similar to mechanical solidarity, which also involves shared beliefs, values, and common practices in simpler societies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) mechanical solidarity.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Review each option and determine if it could contribute to income inequality in the 1980s.\n\n(A) rates of income tax increased equally for all occupational groups:\nThis option suggests that income tax rates increased equally for all occupational groups. However, this would not directly contribute to income inequality as all groups would experience the same increase in tax rates.\n\n(B) there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them:\nThis option implies that there was a shortage of skilled workers to fill the available professional jobs. If this were the case, it could lead to higher wages and income for those who were able to obtain these jobs, thus contributing to income inequality.\n\n(C) the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings:\nThis option states that the price of consumer goods increased at a higher rate than earnings. If this were true, it would mean that people's purchasing power decreased, making it harder for those with lower incomes to afford the rising costs of goods and services, thereby contributing to income inequality.\n\n(D) growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits:\nThis option suggests that growing unemployment led to more people relying on welfare benefits. If a significant portion of the population becomes unemployed and dependent on welfare benefits, it could worsen income inequality.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the options and determine which ones are plausible explanations for the growth in income inequality in the 1980s.\n\nUpon analyzing the options, it appears that options (B), (C), and (D) are plausible explanations for the growth in income inequality in the 1980s.

They would look deeper into the economic and social structures that perpetuate male domination.\n\n(B) Sex classes, through which men oppress women economically, politically, and sexually: This option aligns closely with the core principles of Marxist feminism. Marxist feminists argue that patriarchy operates through the systematic oppression of women by men, not only in the realm of gender politics but also in economic and sexual spheres. This option seems to address this comprehensive understanding.\n\n(C) Women's domestic labor being exploited by the capitalist economy: Marxist feminists emphasize the exploitation of labor within capitalist systems. While this aspect might be considered an important element in Marxist feminist analysis, it may not fully encapsulate the broader concept of patriarchy.\n\n(D) The dual systems of capitalism and male domination: This option encompasses the core beliefs of Marxist feminism. It recognizes that male domination operates within the context of capitalism, suggesting that both systems work in tandem to perpetuate and reinforce patriarchy.\n\nAfter considering all the options, it becomes evident that option (D) provides the most comprehensive explanation of patriarchy according to Marxist feminists as it recognizes the influence of both capitalism and male domination.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",
