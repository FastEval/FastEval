Susan was driving to the water park between 7am and 11am, so she couldn't have gone to the coffee shop during that time.\n2. Susan was buying clothes at the mall between 11am and 12pm, so she couldn't have gone to the coffee shop during that time.\n3. Susan was taking photos near the Eiffel Tower between 12pm and 1pm, so she couldn't have gone to the coffee shop during that time.\n4.
