However, the translation incorrectly states that it is a 70 nm air-to-surface missile.\n\nThe unit \"nm\" (nanometer) is a unit of length that is commonly used to measure the wavelength of light or the size of particles, but it is not a unit of measurement for missile size. The correct unit for missile size would be \"mm\" (millimeter).\n\nTherefore, the error in the translation is the incorrect use of the unit \"nm\" instead of \"mm\", which is a numerical value error. The correct translation should read: \"The FZ90 is an unguided 70mm air-to-surface missile used on aircraft and helicopters.\"\n\nAnswer: (B) Numerical Values",
