The first paragraph mentions that there are three birds on a branch: a blue jay, a quail, and a falcon.\n2. The second paragraph states that the falcon is to the right of the blue jay. This means that the order from left to right is: blue jay, falcon, quail.\n3. The third paragraph states that the blue jay is to the right of the quail. This means that the order from left to right is still the same: blue jay, falcon, quail.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA) The blue jay is the second from the left. This is incorrect, since the blue jay is the first bird from the left.\n\nB) The quail is the second from the left. This is incorrect, since the quail is the third bird from the left.\n\nC) The falcon is the second from the left. This is correct, since the falcon is indeed the second bird from the left.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) The falcon is the second from the left.",

Therefore, the possible orders for the three golfers are:\n\n1. Ada, Mya, Mel\n2. Ada, Mel, Mya\n3. Mya, Ada, Mel\n4. Mya, Mel, Ada\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Mel finished above Ada. This means that Mel cannot be in the third position, as the third position is below Ada. Therefore, the possible orders for the three golfers are:\n\n1. Ada, Mya, Mel\n2. Ada, Mel, Mya\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) Ada finished last - This option is not possible, as Mya finished below Ada, and Mel finished above Ada. Therefore, Ada cannot be in the last position.\n\n(B) Mel finished last - This option is possible, as Mel finished above Ada, and Mya finished below Ada. Therefore, Mel can be in the last position.\n\n(C) Mya finished last - This option is not possible, as Mya finished below Ada, and Mel finished above Ada. Therefore, Mya cannot be in the last position.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the answer is (B) Mel finished last.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",
