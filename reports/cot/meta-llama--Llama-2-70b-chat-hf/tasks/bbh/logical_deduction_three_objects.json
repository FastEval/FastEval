This means that the quail would be on the left, and the blue jay would be in the middle. However, this contradicts our understanding from the paragraph that the quail is on the left, and the blue jay is in the middle. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\nB) The quail is the second from the left. This means that the blue jay would be on the left, and the quail would be in the middle. However, this again contradicts our understanding from the paragraph that the blue jay is to the right of the quail. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\nC) The falcon is the second from the left. This means that the blue jay would be on the left, and the falcon would be in the middle.
