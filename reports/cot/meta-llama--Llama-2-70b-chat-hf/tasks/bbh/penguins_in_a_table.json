The last line of the penguin table contains the information about James, who is 12 years old, 90 cm tall, and weighs 12 kg.\n3. The giraffe table does not include any information about James, as he is not a giraffe.\n4. Therefore, the last giraffe in the table is Donna, who is 9 years old, 440 cm tall, and weighs 650 kg.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is (D) Donna.\n\nI hope this reasoning was helpful and clear! Let me know if you have any further questions.",
