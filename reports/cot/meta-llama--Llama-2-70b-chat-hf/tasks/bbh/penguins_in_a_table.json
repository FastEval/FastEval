            "correct_answer": "(D)",
            "model_answer": "The answer to the question is (D) Donna.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The table provides information about the age, height, and weight of various penguins and giraffes.\n2. The last giraffe listed in the table is Donna, who is 9 years old, 440 cm tall, and weighs 650 kg.\n3. Therefore, the name of the last giraffe is Donna.\n\nSo, the answer is (D) Donna.",
