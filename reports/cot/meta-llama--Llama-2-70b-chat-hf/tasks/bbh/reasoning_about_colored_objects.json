We have three grey notebooks and one purple notebook, so we'll remove four notebooks in total.\n2. Now, let's count the number of grey objects that remain on the floor. We have three grey cat toys and two grey notebooks that we removed, so that's a total of five grey objects.\n3. Since we've removed all the notebooks, we can ignore the mauve and purple notebooks.
