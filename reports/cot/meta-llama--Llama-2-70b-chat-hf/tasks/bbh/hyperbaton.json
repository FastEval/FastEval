Size: Next, come the adjectives that describe the size of the noun, which is \"midsize.\"\n3. Age: After that, we have the age of the noun, which is \"old.\"\n4. Material: Finally, we have the material the noun is made of, which is \"sweater.\"\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the two options:\n\n(A) midsize old grey Brazilian sweater\n\nThis sentence follows the correct adjective order. The adjectives are arranged in the following order: opinion (old), size (midsize), age (old), material (sweater).\n\n(B) midsize grey Brazilian old sweater\n\nThis sentence does not follow the correct adjective order.

            "model_answer": "When it comes to adjective order in English, there are certain rules to follow to ensure that the sentence sounds natural and correct. One of the most common methods for determining the correct order is the \" Op op op\" method, which stands for \"Opinion, Observation, and Description.\"\n\nIn this method, we start with the Opinion, which is the subjective evaluation of the noun. This is usually an adjective that describes how the speaker feels about the noun, such as \"beautiful,\" \"ugly,\" \"happy,\" or \"sad.\"\n\nNext comes the Observation, which is a descriptive word that tells us more about the noun. This can include words like \"big,\" \"small,\" \"tall,\" \"short,\" \"fat,\" or \"thin.\"\n\nFinally, we have the Description, which is a more specific word that describes the noun in detail. This can include words like \"rubber,\" \"gray,\" \"Mexican,\" or \"midsize.\"\n\nNow, let's apply this method to the two options given in the question:\n\nOption A: \"rubber gray walking Mexican midsize cat\"\n\n* Opinion: \"rubber\" (this is not an opinion, it's a material)\n* Observation: \"gray\" (this is a color, which is a descriptive word)\n* Description: \"walking Mexican midsize cat\" (this is a description of the cat's size, breed, and movement)\n\nOption B: \"midsize gray Mexican rubber walking cat\"\n\n* Opinion: \"midsize\" (this is not an opinion, it's a size)\n* Observation: \"gray\" (this is a color, which is a descriptive word)\n* Description: \"Mexican rubber walking cat\" (this is a description of the cat's material, breed, and movement)\n\nApplying the \"Op op op\" method, we can see that Option B follows the correct adjective order. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) midsize gray Mexican rubber walking cat\n\nSo, the correct adjective order is: midsize (opinion), gray (observation), Mexican (description), rubber (description).",

Color adjectives: Color adjectives describe the color of the noun. Examples include \"red,\" \"blue,\" and \"green.\"\n5. Material adjectives: Material adjectives describe the material or substance that the noun is made of. Examples include \"iron,\" \"wooden,\" and \"plastic.\"\n6.

In this case, \"prismlike\" and \"American\" are descriptive adjectives because they describe the physical characteristics and the origin of the chair, respectively.\n\nStep 4: Determine the order of the adjectives\nNow that we have identified the adjectives, we need to determine the order in which they should appear. Generally, opinion adjectives come first, followed by descriptive adjectives.\n\nStep 5: Check for any exceptions\nFinally, we need to check if there are any exceptions to the general guidelines.
