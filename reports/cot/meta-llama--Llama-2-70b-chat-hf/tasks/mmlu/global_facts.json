            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nFirst, let's define what we mean by \"overweight.\" According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a person is considered overweight if their body mass index (BMI) is 25 or higher. BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared (kg/m2).\n\nNext, let's look at the data. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2015-2016, the prevalence of obesity among adults aged 18 and over in the United States was approximately 39.8%. This means that almost 40% of adults in this age group had a BMI of 25 or higher.\n\nNow, let's look at the answer options:\n\n(A) 10% - This is significantly lower than the actual percentage of adults who were overweight in 2016, so this is not the correct answer.\n\n(B) 20% - This is also lower than the actual percentage of adults who were overweight in 2016, so this is not the correct answer.\n\n(C) 40% - This is the correct answer! According to the CDC data, approximately 40% of adults aged 18 and over were overweight in 2016.\n\n(D) 80% - This is significantly higher than the actual percentage of adults who were overweight in 2016, so this is not the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 40%.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to understand what GDP per capita means. GDP per capita is the total GDP of a country divided by its population.\n2. Next, we need to understand what inflation is. Inflation is the rate at which prices for goods and services are rising.\n3. We also need to understand what PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) is. PPP is a method of adjusting for inflation by comparing the cost of a basket of goods and services across different countries.\n4. Now, let's consider the question: What was GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 when adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices?\n5. To answer this question, we need to find the GDP per capita in 1850, adjust it for inflation using a price index, and then convert it to 2011 prices using PPP.\n6. Unfortunately, there are no reliable GDP per capita data available for the United States in 1850. The earliest available data is from 1870.\n7. Therefore, we cannot accurately answer the question.\n\nHowever, I can provide some context. According to historical estimates, the average GDP per capita in the United States during the 1850s was around $1,200. Adjusting for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), this amount would be equivalent to around $34,000 in 2011 dollars. However, this is not a directly comparable number, as it does not account for differences in purchasing power across countries. Using PPP, we would need to adjust this number further to get a more accurate estimate of GDP per capita in 2011 prices.\n\nBased on the available data and methods, the closest answer to the question would be (C) About $8k. However, please note that this is not a definitive answer, as the data and methods used are not ideal for accurately estimating GDP per capita in 1850.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) About $8k.",

According to a Gallup survey conducted in 2019, 63% of Americans believe that homosexuality should be accepted by society.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) 62%.\n\nIt's important to note that public opinion on LGBTQ+ issues has been shifting over time, and acceptance of homosexuality has been increasing. However, it's also important to recognize that there are still significant pockets of resistance and discrimination within society, and there is more work to be done to ensure full equality and acceptance for all members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nAnswer: (B) 62%",

China, the United States, Germany, and Japan are all major players in the solar energy industry.\n\nNow, let's look at some statistics. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China was the largest producer of solar energy in 2019, accounting for over 50% of the world's total solar energy production. The United States was the second-largest producer, followed by Germany and Japan.\n\nBased on this information, it seems clear that the answer to the question is (A) China.\n\nSo, the answer is: (A) China.",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nFirst, let's clarify what GDP per capita is. GDP per capita is a measure of the total output of a country divided by its population. It's a useful way to compare the economic well-being of different countries, as it takes into account the size of the population.\n\nNow, let's talk about the question. The question asks about the change in GDP per capita in Japan from 1950 to 2016, after adjusting for inflation and PPP (Purchasing Power Parity). Inflation is a rise in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. PPP is a way of adjusting for differences in the cost of living between countries.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to find a reliable source of data that provides information on Japan's GDP per capita in both 1950 and 2016, and also takes into account inflation and PPP adjustments. A good source of such data is the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) database.\n\nAccording to the WDI database, in 1950, Japan's GDP per capita in constant 2011 dollars (adjusted for inflation and PPP) was $1,140. In 2016, it was $39,280.\n\nNow, let's calculate the fold increase in GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016:\n\n$39,280 / $1,140 = 34.5\n\nSo, the answer is (D) by 20 fold.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) $39,280.",

Therefore, we need to look at data from 2017 or the closest year available.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the leading causes of death in children under five years old in 2017 were:\n\n1. Preterm birth complications (B)\n2. Lower respiratory infections (A)\n3. Diarrheal diseases (C)\n4. Malaria (D)\n\nNow, let's look at the data for each cause of death.\n\nIn 2017, preterm birth complications were responsible for an estimated 1,041,000 deaths in children under five years old. This accounts for approximately 18% of all deaths in this age group.\n\nLower respiratory infections were the second leading cause of death, accounting for an estimated 810,000 deaths in children under five years old, or around 14% of all deaths in this age group.\n\nDiarrheal diseases were responsible for an estimated 680,000 deaths in children under five years old, or around 12% of all deaths in this age group.\n\nMalaria was responsible for an estimated 219,000 deaths in children under five years old, or around 4% of all deaths in this age group.\n\nBased on this data, it is clear that the biggest cause of death in children under five years old as of 2017 was preterm birth complications (B), followed by lower respiratory infections (A) and diarrheal diseases (C). Malaria (D) was the fourth leading cause of death in this age group.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) Preterm birth complications.\n\nI hope this explanation was helpful and that the answer is clear.

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nFirst, let's start by understanding what we mean by \"safe drinking water.\" Safe drinking water is water that is free from contaminants and pollutants that can pose a risk to human health. This includes water that is free from bacteria, viruses, parasites, and chemicals like lead and arsenic.\n\nNext, let's look at some data from reputable sources to get an idea of the percentage of the global population that does not have access to safe drinking water.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2019, an estimated 2.1 billion people globally did not have access to safely managed drinking water services. This means that they did not have access to water that is both available and safe to drink.\n\nNow, let's convert this number to a percentage. To do this, we need to divide the number of people who do not have access to safe drinking water by the total global population.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, the estimated global population in 2019 was 7.7 billion people.\n\nSo, if we divide 2.1 billion by 7.7 billion, we get approximately 0.27, or 27%.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (C) 30%. This means that as of 2019, approximately 30% of the global population did not have access to safe drinking water.\n\n(C) 30%",
