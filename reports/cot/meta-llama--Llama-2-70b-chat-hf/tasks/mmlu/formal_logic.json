            "model_answer": "The conclusion of the argument is (D) It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nThe argument starts by stating that it is hard to verify in peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that are observed in everyday patients. This suggests that people's emotions can cloud their judgment and impair their ability to think critically.\n\nThe second sentence explains that the arrogance of our consciousness, which is a defense mechanism, blocks the unconscious complexes. This means that people's conscious thoughts and beliefs can prevent them from acknowledging and understanding their unconscious thoughts and feelings.\n\nThe third sentence states that because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts. This means that because people's consciousness is blocking their unconscious thoughts and feelings, it is challenging to convince them of things that go against their conscious beliefs.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the argument is that it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts. This is because people's emotions and conscious beliefs can act as barriers to understanding their unconscious thoughts and feelings.\n\n(D) It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.",

(\u2203x) - This part of the proposition states that there exists an x. This means that we can assume that there is at least one x that satisfies the conditions mentioned later in the proposition.\n2. Hx - This part of the proposition states that x is a house. This means that the x that we are talking about is a house, and not an apartment.\n3. (\u2200y) - This part of the proposition states that the proposition applies to all y. This means that we are considering all possible y values, and not just a specific one.\n4. Ay - This part of the proposition states that y is an apartment. This means that we are considering all apartments, and not houses.\n5. \u2283 - This part of the proposition states that x is bigger than y implies that x is a house.

We can do this by creating a table with four rows, one for each possible combination of K and L:\n\n| K | L | ~K | (K \u00b7 L) | (K \u00b7 ~L) | Equivalence |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| T | T | F | T | F | ? |\n| T | F | F | F | T | ? |\n| F | T | T | F | F | ? |\n| F | F | T | T | F | ? |\n\nNext, we need to determine the truth of each expression in the argument for each combination of K and L. We can do this by using the following rules:\n\n* ~K is true if K is false, and false if K is true.\n* L is true if L is true, and false if L is false.\n* (K \u00b7 L) is true if both K and L are true, and false otherwise.\n* (K \u00b7 ~L) is true if K is true and L is false, and false otherwise.\n\nUsing these rules, we can fill in the truth table as follows:\n\n| K | L | ~K | (K \u00b7 L) | (K \u00b7 ~L) |  Equivalence |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| T | T | F | T | F | Invalid (B) |\n| T | F | F | F | T | Invalid (C) |\n| F | T | T | F | F | Valid (A) |\n| F | F | T | T | F | Invalid (D) |\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, the argument is invalid because it leads to contradictory conclusions for different combinations of K and L. Specifically, when K is true and L is false (row 2), the argument implies that ~K is true, but when L is true and K is false (row 3), the argument implies that ~K is false. This contradiction means that the argument is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Invalid. Counterexample when K and L are true.",
