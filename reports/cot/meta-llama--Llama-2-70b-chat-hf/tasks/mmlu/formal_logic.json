(Sigmund Freud, The Origin and Development of Psychoanalysis)\n\n(A) It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients.\n(B) The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.\n(C) Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n(D) It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.",

            "model_answer": "The conclusion of the argument is (D) It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nThe argument starts by stating that it is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients. This suggests that people's intelligence can be affected by their emotions, and that this effect can be observed in both patients and peers.\n\nThe second sentence, The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes, explains why it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious. The arrogance of consciousness refers to the tendency of people to overestimate the abilities of their conscious mind and underestimate the role of the unconscious in shaping their thoughts and behaviors. This arrogance can prevent people from acknowledging the existence and influence of unconscious complexes.\n\nThe third sentence, Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts, further explains the consequences of the arrogance of consciousness. It suggests that not only is it difficult to convince people of the existence of the unconscious, but also challenging to teach them about the unconscious because their conscious knowledge and beliefs may contradict it.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the argument is (D) It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts. This answer choice accurately summarizes the main point of the argument, which is that the arrogance of consciousness makes it challenging to convince people of the existence and influence of the unconscious.\n\n(D) It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.",

First, let's break down the given proposition:\n\n(\u2203x)[(Ax \u2022 Lx) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Hy \u2022 Bxy)]\n\nThis states that there exists an object x that is both an apartment (Ax) and large (Lx), and there exists a object y that is a house (Hy) and bigger than x (Bxy).\n\n2. Now, let's look at the four options:\n\n(A) Some large houses are bigger than some apartments.\n(B) Some houses are bigger than all large apartments.\n(C) Some large apartments are bigger than some houses.\n(D) Some houses are bigger thatn some large apartments.\n\n3. We can immediately eliminate option (D), because it is not logically consistent with the given proposition. The proposition states that there exists a house that is bigger than some large apartments, but not that some houses are bigger than all large apartments.\n\n4. Next, let's consider option (A). This option states that some large houses are bigger than some apartments. This is consistent with the proposition, because it allows for the possibility that some large houses may be bigger than some large apartments. However, it's not the most specific option, as it doesn't take into account the additional information that the proposition provides about the relationship between the house and the apartment.\n\n5. Option (C) states that some large apartments are bigger than some houses. This is also consistent with the proposition, because it allows for the possibility that some large apartments may be bigger than some houses. However, like option (A), it's not the most specific option.\n\n6. Finally, we have option (B), which states that some houses are bigger than all large apartments. This option is inconsistent with the proposition, because it implies that all large apartments are smaller than some houses, which is not necessarily true. The proposition only states that there exists a house that is bigger than some large apartments, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that there may be large apartments that are bigger than some houses.\n\n7. Therefore, the best English interpretation of the given proposition is option (A) Some large houses are bigger than some apartments.\n\nThe answer is (A).",
