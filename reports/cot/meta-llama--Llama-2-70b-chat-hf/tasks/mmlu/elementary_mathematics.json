We also know that she drove the same number of miles each day.\n3. So, to find out how many miles she drove each day, we can divide the total number of miles she drove by the number of days she drove.\n4. In this case, we can divide 40 miles by 5 days: 40 miles \u00f7 5 days = 8 miles per day.\n5. Therefore, the answer is (C) 8 miles per day.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) 8.",
