            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The equation is 24 = 2p.\n2. We know that 24 is a multiple of 2, so we can write 24 = 2a, where a is an integer.\n3. Substituting 2a for 24 in the original equation, we get 2a = 2p.\n4. Now, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2, which gives us a = p.\n5. Therefore, the value of p is a, which is an integer.\n6. Based on the given options, the only integer option is (A) p = 4.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) p = 4.",

In other words, the number of miles she drove each day is equal to the total number of miles divided by 5.\n\nSo, to find out how many miles Ms. Perez drove each day, we can simply divide 40 by 5:\n\n40 \u00f7 5 = 8\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 8.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) 8.",
