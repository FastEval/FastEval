The symbol \"p\" represents a permutation, which is a way of arranging a set of elements in a particular order. In this case, p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) means that the elements 1, 2, 5, and 4 are being permuted in a specific way, and then the elements 2 and 3 are being permuted in a different way.\n\nThe question is asking us to find the index of p in S_5, which is the symmetric group of degree 5. The symmetric group of degree 5 consists of all the possible ways of permuting a set of 5 elements.\n\nTo find the index of p in S_5, we need to first determine the cycle structure of p. The cycle structure of a permutation is a way of describing the permutation as a product of disjoint cycles.\n\nIn this case, we can see that p has two cycles: (1, 2, 5, 4) and (2, 3). The cycle (1, 2, 5, 4) has length 4, and the cycle (2, 3) has length 2.\n\nNext, we need to find the order of p, which is the least common multiple of the lengths of its cycles. In this case, the order of p is the least common multiple of 4 and 2, which is 8.\n\nTherefore, the index of p in S_5 is 8.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) 8.",
