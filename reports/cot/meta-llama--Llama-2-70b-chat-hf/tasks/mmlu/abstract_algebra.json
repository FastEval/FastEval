The degree of a field extension is defined as the smallest number of generators needed to generate the entire extension.\n\nStep 1: Check if the given roots are linearly independent.\n\nWe can check if the roots are linearly independent by computing their Wronskian:\n\nW(\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a18) = \u221a2 \\* \u221a3 \\* \u221a18 - \u221a3 \\* \u221a2 \\* \u221a18 - \u221a18 \\* \u221a2 \\* \u221a3 + \u221a18 \\* \u221a3 \\* \u221a2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nW(\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a18) = 2 \\* 3 \\* 18 - 3 \\* 2 \\* 18 - 18 \\* 2 \\* 3 + 18 \\* 3 \\* 2\n\nW(\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a18) = 108 - 54 - 54 + 54\n\nW(\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a18) = 108\n\nSince the Wronskian is non-zero, we can conclude that the given roots are linearly independent, and therefore, the field extension has a degree of at least 3.\n\nStep 2: Check if there are any relations between the roots.\n\nWe can check for relations by computing the resultant of the three polynomials:\n\nResultant(x^2 - 2, x^2 - 3, x^2 - 18) = (x^4 - 10x^2 + 2) \\* (x^4 - 6x^2 + 3) \\* (x^4 - 12x^2 + 18)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nResultant(x^2 - 2, x^2 - 3, x^2 - 18) = x^8 - 24x^6 + 32x^4 - 10x^2 + 6\n\nSince the resultant is not the zero polynomial, we can conclude that there are no relations between the roots, and therefore, the field extension has a degree of exactly 3.\n\nStep 3: Compute the degree of the field extension.\n\nSince we have shown that the field extension has a degree of exactly 3, we can compute the degree of the field extension as follows:\n\n[Q(\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a18):Q] = 3\n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension Q(\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a18) over Q is 3.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(C) 2",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nFirst, let's understand what the question is asking. The notation (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) represents a permutation in the symmetric group S_5, which is a group of all permutations of 5 elements. The permutation (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) specifies a sequence of 5 elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 2, the third element is 5, the fourth element is 4, and the fifth element is 3.\n\nNow, the question is asking us to find the index of this permutation in S_5. The index of a permutation in a group is the number of times that permutation occurs in a specific order. In this case, we need to find the number of permutations in S_5 that are equal to (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) when written in a specific order.\n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that the symmetric group S_5 has 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120 elements. We can also use the fact that the order of the elements in the permutation (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) is important, meaning that (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) is not the same as (2, 3, 1, 5, 4) or any other permutation of the same elements.\n\nTherefore, the index of the permutation (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) in S_5 is 1, because there is only one way to write this permutation in the specific order given.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(D) 120",

A factor group is a group that is constructed by identifying certain elements of a larger group as \"equivalent\" and forming a new group that contains one representative from each equivalence class.

A normal subgroup is a subgroup that is invariant under conjugation by elements of the larger group.
