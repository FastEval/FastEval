            "model_answer": "The answer to the question is (B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The first criterion mentioned is \"encourage unsafe practices.\" This implies that the advertisement should not promote or encourage practices that could potentially harm the viewer or others.\n2. The second criterion is \"cause unnecessary distress.\" This means that the advertisement should not cause unnecessary emotional distress or discomfort to the viewer.\n3. The third criterion is \"cause fear.\" This suggests that the advertisement should not intentionally scare or intimidate the viewer.\n4. The fourth criterion is \"cause offence.\" This means that the advertisement should not contain content that is offensive or insulting to any particular group of people.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious.

            "model_answer": "The answer to the question is (D) Employee duties.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. The question states that the obligations are based on individual contracts and wider employment laws.\n2. Employee rights are protected by law and individual contracts, but they do not outline the obligations of workers towards their employer.\n3. Employer duties, on the other hand, are the responsibilities that employers have towards their employees, as outlined in individual contracts and employment laws.\n4.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer to the question is (D) Work-life balance.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The question states that the issue is related to the intensification of work and technological shifts, which suggests that the issue is related to the workplace and the impact of technology on work.\n2. The question mentions an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities, which suggests that the issue is related to the balance between work and personal life.\n3. Option (A) Presenteeism refers to the practice of being present at work without being productive, which is not related to the issue of work-life balance.\n4. Option (B) Absenteeism refers to the practice of being absent from work without permission, which is also not related to the issue of work-life balance.\n5. Option (C) Work-play balance is not a commonly used term, and it does not accurately reflect the issue described in the question.\n6. Option (D) Work-life balance is a commonly used term that refers to the balance between an individual's work and personal life, which accurately reflects the issue described in the question.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Work-life balance.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\n\nThe given sentence describes a concept that can be likened to its natural counterpart, which implies a comparison between two similar systems. The sentence highlights the importance of interdependence and balance in these systems.\n\n Option A, \"Industrial supply loops,\" does not accurately reflect the comparison between natural and industrial systems described in the sentence. While industrial supply loops are important for efficiency and sustainability, they are not necessarily interdependent or balanced in the same way as natural ecosystems.\n\n Option B, \"Industrial ecosystems,\" is a good fit for the given sentence. An industrial ecosystem refers to a network of interconnected industries, companies, and activities that interact with each other and their environment in a dynamic and interdependent manner. This concept acknowledges the interdependence of various industries and recognizes the impact they have on each other and the environment.\n\n Option C, \"Ecological ecosystems,\" is not directly related to the comparison between natural and industrial systems described in the sentence. While ecological ecosystems are indeed interdependent and balanced systems, they are not necessarily subject to the same considerations of companies and industries as the sentence implies.\n\n Option D, \"Corporate ecosystems,\" is also not a suitable answer. This term typically refers to the interactions between different departments or teams within a single corporation, rather than the interdependence of multiple industries and their environments.\n\nAnswer: (B) Industrial ecosystems.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Power imbalance, Resources, Co-opted.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. The first limitation mentioned is \"power imbalance.\" This refers to a situation where one party has more power or influence than the other in a business-CSO collaboration. This can lead to an unfair distribution of resources, where one party gains more from the relationship than the other.\n2. The second limitation mentioned is \"unfair distribution of resources.\" This can occur when one party has more resources, such as funding, expertise, or technology, and the other party does not have access to these resources. This can lead to a situation where one party gains more benefits from the collaboration than the other.\n3. The third limitation mentioned is \"CSOs being co-opted.\" This means that CSOs may be influenced or controlled by the business partner, which can lead to a loss of independence and credibility for the CSO.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Power imbalance, Resources, Co-opted.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "My reasoning for this question is as follows:\n\n1. Corporate profit maximization is a concept that is often associated with capitalism and the pursuit of financial gain.\n2. Hedonistic utilitarianism is a ethical theory that suggests that actions are right if they promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.\n3. Preference utilitarianism is a ethical theory that suggests that actions are right if they promote the greatest satisfaction of preferences for the greatest number of people.\n4. The Categorical Imperative is a ethical theory developed by Immanuel Kant that suggests that actions are right if they are in accordance with universal moral laws that could be willed by a rational being.\n5. Ethics of care is a ethical theory that emphasizes empathy, compassion, and care in relationships and decision-making.\n\nBased on these definitions, the answer to the question \"Although corporate profit maximization is not directly prescribed by major normative theories to which normative theory is it most similar?\" would be (B) preference utilitarianism. This is because corporate profit maximization is focused on maximizing the preferences of shareholders and stakeholders, which aligns with the principles of preference utilitarianism.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) preference utilitarianism.",

Milton Friedman is a well-known economist who has expressed his views on the social responsibility of business.\n2. Friedman's view is that the sole responsibility of business is to its shareholders.\n3. He argues that managers should act in ways that maximize profits for shareholders, as this is their primary duty.\n4. Friedman does not believe that businesses have a primary responsibility to society or employees.\n5. Instead, he believes that businesses should focus on creating value for shareholders, and that socially responsible actions should be left to individuals and governments.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer to the question is (A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders.\n\n(A)",

The question states that the regulation goes further than the interactions that CSOs (Civil Society Organizations) have with businesses. This suggests that the regulation is related to the interactions between CSOs and businesses, but goes beyond them.\n2. The phrase \"concerns mechanics\" suggests that the regulation is related to the way that processes work, or the mechanisms by which they operate.\n3. The word \"political\" fits best as the first word in the sentence, as it suggests that the regulation is related to political processes or decisions.\n4. The word \"interactions\" fits best as the second word, as it suggests that the regulation is related to the interactions between different groups or entities.\n5. The word \"outcomes\" fits best as the third word, as it suggests that the regulation is related to the outcomes or results of these interactions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Political, Interactions, Outcomes.",

The question is asking for the term that refers to working patterns that involve temporal, spatial, and task-related fluidity.\n2. Temporal fluidity refers to the ability to work at different times or have a flexible schedule. Spatial fluidity refers to the ability to work from different locations or have a flexible workspace. Task-related fluidity refers to the ability to perform a variety of tasks or have a flexible job description.\n3.
