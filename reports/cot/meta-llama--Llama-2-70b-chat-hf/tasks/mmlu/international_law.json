            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The question is asking about which state exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels.\n2. We need to consider the different options given in the question:\n\t* (A) The coastal State\n\t* (B) The flag State\n\t* (C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction\n\t* (D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea\n3. Let's analyze each option:\n\t* (A) The coastal State: This option seems plausible, as the coastal state may have jurisdiction over crimes committed within its territorial waters. However, we need to check if this is indeed the case.\n\t* (B) The flag State: This option also seems plausible, as the flag state may have jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels flying its flag. However, we need to check if this is indeed the case.\n\t* (C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction: This option seems unlikely, as jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels is generally not granted to all states.\n\t* (D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea: This option seems unlikely, as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea primarily deals with disputes relating to the interpretation and application of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n4. Based on our analysis, the most likely answer is (A) The coastal State.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (A) The coastal State.",

            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nThe Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention are related concepts, but they have some key differences.\n\nFirstly, R2P is a more recent concept than humanitarian intervention. R2P was endorsed by all UN member states in 2005, while humanitarian intervention has been a topic of debate for several decades.\n\nSecondly, R2P is a more specific concept than humanitarian intervention. R2P is specifically focused on preventing and responding to four types of mass atrocities: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses a wide range of situations where there is a need for relief and assistance.\n\nThirdly, R2P places a greater emphasis on the role of the state in addressing humanitarian crises. Under R2P, the primary responsibility for protecting civilians lies with the state itself. If a state is unable or unwilling to fulfill this responsibility, the international community may intervene through a range of measures, including diplomatic, humanitarian, and if necessary, military action. In contrast, humanitarian intervention often implies a unilateral decision by external actors to intervene in a situation, without necessarily involving the consent or participation of the affected state.\n\nFourthly, R2P requires a more formal process of authorization than humanitarian intervention. Under R2P, any intervention must be authorized by the UN Security Council, which ensures that the intervention is carried out in accordance with international law and with the support of the international community. Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, may not always involve such a formal process of authorization.\n\nFinally, R2P always involves a focus on prevention, whereas humanitarian intervention may involve a range of responses, including prevention, relief, and recovery.\n\nBased on these differences, the correct answer is (C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

The UK Constitution is not based solely on the power of the sovereign, but rather it is a combination of various sources, including statutes, common law, and conventions.\n\nB) The UK Constitution gives the judiciary the power to overturn acts of parliament: This statement is also incorrect.

            "model_answer": "The answer to the question is (B) It is an obligation of conduct, i.e., States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means. This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes is a fundamental principle of international law. It is not an obligation of result, meaning that States are not required to resolve their disputes necessarily. Instead, it is an obligation of conduct, which means that States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means. This obligation does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes, but rather an obligation to make an effort to do so.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because it suggests that States are under a strict obligation to resolve their disputes as soon as possible, which is not the case. Option (C) is also incorrect because while the peaceful settlement of disputes is a peremptory norm of international law, it is not an obligation that concerns solely international courts and tribunals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) It is an obligation of conduct, i.e., States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider statement (A) Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three judge to a one judge formation. This statement is actually true. Protocol 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which came into force on June 1, 2010, changed the composition of the Committee that hears admissibility cases from a three-judge formation to a single judge formation.\n2. Next, let's look at statement (B) Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility. This statement is also true. Protocol 14 introduced a new criterion for admissibility, which requires that the application must be significantly well-founded, in addition to the existing criteria of being within the jurisdiction of the State and not being anonymous or pseudonymous.\n3. Moving on to statement (C) Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights, this statement is actually false. Protocol 14 did not abolish the Commission of Human Rights. Instead, it transformed the Commission into a single judicial institution called the European Court of Human Rights, which is responsible for both admissibility and merits.\n4. Finally, let's consider statement (D) Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights. This statement is false. Protocol 14 did not extend the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights. The term of office for judges of the European Court of Human Rights remains nine years, as it was before Protocol 14 came into force.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the false statement is (D) Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nSo, the answer is (D).",

The size of the island is not a determining factor in whether it is considered a rock or not.\n\n(B) Rocks are the islands that do not have any maritime zone - This option also does not align with the definition of a rock as per UNCLOS. The absence of a maritime zone does not necessarily mean that an island is a rock.\n\n(C) Rocks are the islands which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and according to article 121 (3) have no Exclusive Economic Zone or continental shelf - This option aligns with the definition of a rock as per UNCLOS. The island must be naturally formed, not submerged at high tide, and incapable of sustaining human habitation or economic life of its own.\n\n(D) Rocks are the small islands that can sustain human habitation - This option does not align with the definition of a rock as per UNCLOS. The definition of a rock specifically states that it cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of its own.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Rocks are the islands which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and according to article 121 (3) have no Exclusive Economic Zone or continental shelf.\n\nSo, the answer is (C).",

The UN Human Rights Council is not a treaty-based human rights mechanism. It is a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly and is responsible for promoting and protecting human rights around the world. While it does have some treaty-based functions, such as monitoring the implementation of human rights treaties, it is not established under a specific treaty and therefore does not fit the criteria.\n3. The UN Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is not a treaty-based human rights mechanism. It is a process established by the UN Human Rights Council to review the human rights records of all UN Member States. While it does involve the evaluation of a State's compliance with human rights obligations, it is not based on a specific treaty and therefore does not fit the criteria.\n4. The UN special mandates are not a treaty-based human rights mechanism.
