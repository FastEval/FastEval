By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

            "model_answer": "The answer to the question can be found by analyzing the given passage and identifying the main argument presented.\n\nThe passage explains how early cannons were useful in Western Europe during the 1200s to 1400s for protracted sieges, whereas in China, mobile steppe nomads were a bigger threat, and therefore, the focus was on improving horse archer units. This information highlights how different regions prioritized different military strategies based on their specific needs and enemies.\n\nNow, let's evaluate how this argument relates to the given large-scale questions about global history:\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other.\nThe passage does not discuss technology sharing between societies, so this answer choice does not align with the argument.\n\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.\nThe passage provides some background information that could potentially contribute to this question. It explains how early cannons proved useful in Western Europe, leading to further experimentation and improvement of gunpowder weapons. However, it does not directly address why European states specifically attained military superiority over non-Western powers.\n\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\nThe passage does not mention Silk Road commerce or its decline, so this answer choice is not relevant.\n\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion.\nThe passage does not discuss climate or cultural diffusion, so this answer choice is also not relevant.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the answer that most closely relates to the argument in the passage is:\n\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him.

            "model_answer": "The answer can be found by analyzing the given passage and identifying the relevant information related to trade with Asia.\n\nStep 1: Look for mentions of trade or economic activities in the passage.\nThe passage mentions the following economic activities:\n\n* The king levies a tax of one golden dinar on every donkey-load of salt brought into the country and two dinars when it is sent out.\n* The king's due from a load of copper is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals.\n* The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, leaving only gold dust for the people.\n\nStep 2: Look for mentions of goods or products that could be indicative of trade with Asia.\nThe passage mentions the following goods or products:\n\n* Salt\n* Copper\n* Other goods (not specified)\n* Gold dust\n* Gold nuggets\n\nStep 3: Analyze the mentions of goods or products to determine if they could be indicative of trade with Asia.\nThe mention of salt, copper, and other goods could indicate trade with Asia, as these goods were commonly traded goods in the medieval period. However, it is not specified where these goods came from, so this alone is not conclusive evidence of trade with Asia.\n\nThe mention of gold dust and gold nuggets is more significant, as gold was a valuable commodity that was often traded over long distances. It is possible that the gold came from Asia, but again, it is not specified where it came from.\n\nStep 4: Look for any other clues in the passage that could suggest trade with Asia.\nThe passage mentions the king's adornment with gold and jewels, which could suggest trade with Asia, as gold and jewels were valuable commodities that were often traded over long distances. However, it is not specified where these goods came from, so this alone is not conclusive evidence of trade with Asia.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the evidence and choose the best answer.\nBased on the analysis above, the best answer is (C) The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India. While it is not specified where the gold and jewels came from, it is likely that they were obtained through trade with Asia, as gold and jewels were valuable commodities that were often traded over long distances.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.",

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea.

The passage explains that the American colonel, Bonesteel, was concerned about the Soviet Union's advance into Korea and wanted to establish a surrender zone that would prevent the Soviets from taking over all of Korea. This shows that the Korean peninsula was in a vulnerable position, with external powers vying for control over its territory.\n\nThe decision to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the surrender zones for Japanese forces in Korea had a lasting impact on the country. It effectively divided Korea into two zones, with the Soviet Union controlling the north and the United States controlling the south. This division would eventually lead to the establishment of two separate governments, and the peninsula would remain divided for decades to come.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"How did the events depicted here affect Koreans?\" is (D) Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1.

Hitler and the Nazi Party capitalized on this sentiment, promising to reverse the treaty's terms and restore German honor and power.

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.
