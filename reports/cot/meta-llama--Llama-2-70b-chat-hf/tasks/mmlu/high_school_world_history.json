By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

Therefore, it is unlikely that Sukarno was referring to the Korean War in his address.\n\n(C) The Cold War: The Cold War was a global ideological conflict between the Western world, led by the United States, and the Eastern Bloc, led by the Soviet Union. Sukarno's speech emphasizes the importance of peace and unity among Asian and African nations, which aligns with the concept of non-alignment or neutrality during the Cold War era.

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

            "model_answer": "The events described in the passage had a significant impact on the people of Korea. The passage explains that the nearest American troops to Korea were 600 miles away, and the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea or were already there. This means that the Korean peninsula was in a vulnerable position, with no immediate military protection from the United States or other allied forces.\n\nThe decision made by Colonel Bonesteel to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities had a profound impact on the people of Korea. The decision effectively split the country into two zones, with the Soviet Union controlling the northern part of the peninsula and the United States controlling the southern part.\n\nThe impact of this decision on the people of Korea can be seen in the following ways:\n\n* The division of the country led to the establishment of two separate governments, with the Soviet-backed Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the US-backed Republic of Korea (South Korea) emerging in 1948. This division has had far-reaching consequences for the people of Korea, including the establishment of two separate economies, political systems, and societies.\n* The division of the country also led to the Korean War (1950-1953), which resulted in significant human suffering, displacement, and loss of life. The war had a profound impact on the people of Korea, causing widespread destruction and disrupting the lives of millions of people.\n* The ongoing division of the country has also had a lasting impact on the people of Korea, with tensions between North and South Korea remaining high. This has resulted in limited economic and social interaction between the two countries, and has also led to a state of heightened military alert, with both countries maintaining a significant military presence along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates them.\n\nIn conclusion, the events depicted in the passage had a profound impact on the people of Korea, leading to the division of the country and the establishment of two separate governments. The ongoing tensions between North and South Korea continue to have a significant impact on the people of Korea, with limited economic and social interaction between the two countries and a heightened military alert along the DMZ.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.",
