The access matrix approach to protection involves storing information about which processes have access to which resources.\n2. The matrix can become large and difficult to manage if it is not implemented carefully.\n3. The access matrix can express simple protection requirements, such as which processes can read or write to a specific resource.\n4. However, the access matrix cannot express complex protection requirements, such as hierarchical or role-based access control.\n5. Deciding whether a process has access to a resource based on the access matrix is decidable, meaning it can be determined algorithmically.\n6. The access matrix can be used to enforce access control policies, but it does not provide a way to express who has the right to change the access matrix itself.\n7. Therefore, option (D) there is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

Now, let's think about how the block size affects the time required for a file read operation. Intuitively, we would expect the time required to read a large file to decrease as the block size increases, since fewer blocks need to be read.\n4. Specifically, the time required to read a large file under version 2 should be approximately 1/4 the time required to read the same large file under version 1, since the block size has increased by a factor of 4.\n5.

Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nII. It permits implementation of virtual memory.\n\nThis statement does not describe a property of a purely segmented memory system. Virtual memory is a technique that allows a computer to use more memory than it physically has by temporarily transferring pages of memory to disk storage when the physical memory is full.

Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nIII. It suffers from internal fragmentation.\n\nThis statement describes a property of a purely segmented memory system. In a purely segmented memory system, memory is divided into variable-sized logical segments, and the size of each segment is determined by the size of the program or data being stored in it.

In floating-point arithmetic, this is indeed the case because some numbers have no exact representation. For example, 0.1 cannot be exactly represented as a binary fraction, so the result of operations involving 0.1 can depend on the order in which they are performed. Therefore, statement (A) is true.\n\n(B) It is inherently nonassociative because there have to be upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers.\n\nThis statement is also true. In floating-point arithmetic, there are limits to the range of values that can be represented, and these limits can affect the associativity of operations. For example, if you have two numbers that are very large or very small, their sum or product may not be well-defined, or may result in a value that is outside the representable range. Therefore, statement (B) is true.\n\n(C) Associativity can be achieved with appropriate roundoff conventions.\n\nThis statement is false. Associativity refers to the fact that the result of an operation does not depend on the order in which it is performed. In floating-point arithmetic, associativity is not always possible because of the non-associative nature of the operations. While roundoff conventions can help to mitigate this issue, they cannot completely eliminate it. Therefore, statement (C) is false.\n\n(D) Some rational numbers have no exact representation.\n\nThis statement is true.

Therefore, statement (D) is true.\n\nNow that we have analyzed each statement, we can determine which one is not true.
