The investigator weighed a simple random sample of seven tablets and obtained the weights 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(B) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n(D) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n\nOption (A) is the probability of a t-statistic greater than 1.54 with degrees of freedom (df) equal to 6. This is the correct formula for the P-value, but we need to check if the degrees of freedom are correct.\n\nOption (B) is twice the probability of a t-statistic greater than 1.54 with degrees of freedom (df) equal to 6. This is not the correct formula for the P-value.\n\nOption (C) is the probability of a t-statistic greater than 1.54 with degrees of freedom (df) equal to 7. This is the correct formula for the P-value, but we need to check if the degrees of freedom are correct.\n\nOption (D) is twice the probability of a t-statistic greater than 1.54 with degrees of freedom (df) equal to 7. This is not the correct formula for the P-value.\n\nNow, let's check the degrees of freedom:\n\nThe degrees of freedom for a t-test are calculated as (number of samples - number of parameters) - 1. In this case, we have seven samples and one parameter (the population mean), so the degrees of freedom are 7 - 1 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6.\n\nSo, the final answer is: (A)",

Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n(A) If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level.\n\nThis statement is false. The fact that a null hypothesis can be rejected at a 10% significance level does not necessarily mean that it can also be rejected at a 5% significance level. The 10% level indicates that there is a 10% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis by chance alone, while the 5% level indicates that there is a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis by chance alone. Therefore, the 10% level is a weaker statement than the 5% level, and it is possible for a null hypothesis to be rejected at the 10% level but not at the 5% level.\n\n(B) Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.\n\nThis statement is true. The decision of whether to use a one-sided or two-sided test depends on the nature of the research question and the data collected. A one-sided test is used when the direction of the effect is known or hypothesized beforehand, while a two-sided test is used when the direction of the effect is unknown or unspecified. Therefore, the decision of which type of test to use is typically made after the data have been collected and analyzed.\n\n(C) If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nThis statement is false. The 1% level indicates that there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis by chance alone, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. However, if the null hypothesis is actually false, then the probability of rejecting it is greater than 1%. Therefore, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis is not necessarily 1% just because the test is conducted at the 1% level.\n\n(D) The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\n\nThis statement is true. The power of a hypothesis test refers to its ability to detect a significant effect or difference when it exists. In other words, it measures the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. A high-powered test is able to detect even small but significant effects, while a low-powered test may fail to detect even large effects.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is (D) The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\n\n(D)",
