            "model_answer": "The responsibility to protect is a global political commitment that was endorsed by all member states of the United Nations (UN) in 2005. It is aimed at protecting populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. The principle has three pillars:\n\n1. The state has the primary responsibility to protect its population from mass atrocities and human rights violations.\n2. The international community has a responsibility to assist states in fulfilling their protection obligations.\n3. If a state is unable or unwilling to protect its population, the international community has the responsibility to intervene through a range of measures, including diplomatic, humanitarian, and if necessary, military action.\n\nBased on the above information, the correct answer is (C) The responsibility to remain sovereign.\n\nThe responsibility to remain sovereign is not an element of the responsibility to protect, as it is not mentioned in the three pillars of the principle. The responsibility to protect emphasizes the state's primary responsibility to protect its population, but it does not imply that the state has a responsibility to maintain its sovereignty. In fact, the principle recognizes that the international community may need to intervene in cases where a state is unable or unwilling to protect its population, which could potentially infringe on its sovereignty.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) The responsibility to remain sovereign.\n\n(C)",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

This perspective focuses on the interdependence of nations in the global economy and the idea that cooperation is necessary to maintain energy security. This is a liberal perspective as it emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and the global economy in ensuring energy security, rather than relying on individual state powers or military strength.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).\n\n(A)",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

            "model_answer": "The answer to the question \"In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\" can be explained step-by-step as follows:\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n\nExplanation: Governments have recognized the threat of transnational crime (TNC) to their national security and have responded by addressing it domestically. They have also shared information bilaterally to bring criminals to justice.\n\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n\nExplanation: As TNC expanded in the 1990s, governments began to take measures to reduce the differences in legislation and law enforcement capabilities between countries. They have focused on targeting the individuals and organizations responsible for the crimes, rather than the criminal markets.\n\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n\nExplanation: The US war on drugs has had a significant impact on how governments have responded to TNC. They have emphasized cooperation between law enforcement agencies and used sticks to encourage states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.\n\nExplanation: The Global War on Terror has led to the militarization of law enforcement, with a focus on using military technology and intelligence to combat TNC. This approach has been criticized for neglecting the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to illicit trade.\n\nAnswer: (D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) Nationalization: state enterprises should be protected.\n\nThe Washington Consensus is a set of 10 economic policies that were widely adopted by developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s. These policies were designed to promote economic growth and stability, and were advocated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the US Treasury Department.\n\nThe 10 steps of the Washington Consensus are:\n\n1. Fiscal Discipline: budget deficits of no more than 2 per cent of GDP.\n2. Tax Reform: broadening the tax base, cut marginal tax rates, improve tax administration.\n3. Privatization: privatizing state-owned enterprises.\n4. Deregulation: removing regulations that impede market forces.\n5. Trade Liberalization: reducing tariffs and other trade barriers.\n6. Investment in Human Capital: increasing investment in education and health.\n7. Financial Sector Liberalization: removing restrictions on financial markets and institutions.\n8. Monetary Policy: adopting a monetary policy that is focused on low inflation.\n9. Open Foreign Investment: allowing foreign investment in domestic markets.\n10. Property Rights: legal reforms to secure property rights without excessive costs and to regularize the informal sector.\n\nThe option (D) Nationalization: state enterprises should be protected is not one of the 10 steps of the Washington Consensus.
