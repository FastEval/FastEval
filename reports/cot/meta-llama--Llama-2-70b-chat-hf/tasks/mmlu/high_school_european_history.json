The author, Thomas Henry Huxley, suggests that the idea of a physical basis of life may be novel to many people, who often conceive of life as something that works through matter.\n3. The passage explains that the matter of life, as far as we know it, breaks down into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which have no properties other than those of ordinary matter.\n\nBased on the information provided, the best answer is (C) life is merely a property of a certain kind of matter.

This suggests that there was no single, dominant form of worship, and that different forms of worship coexisted.\n\nSecondly, the philosopher viewed all modes of worship as equally false. This implies that the philosopher did not believe in the validity of any particular form of worship, and instead saw them all as having equal value.\n\nLastly, the magistrate viewed all modes of worship as equally useful. This indicates that the magistrate recognized the importance of religion in maintaining social order and stability, and saw the various forms of worship as serving a useful purpose in this regard.\n\nBased on these points, the best summary of Gibbon's interpretation of religious worship in ancient Rome is:\n\n(A) In ancient Rome, religious worship was decentralized and tended to vary with one's social position.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\n(A) De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n(C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n(D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.",

Columbus describes the natives as being generous and willing to trade their resources for trifles, and he expresses his desire to convert them to Christianity and establish a positive relationship with them.\n\nSource 2 is an excerpt from Bartholomew de las Casas' book \"A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies,\" written in 1542. De las Casas describes the Spanish treatment of the natives as brutal and oppressive, detailing the various forms of torture and violence they inflicted upon them. He attributes the Spanish actions to their desire for gold and wealth.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the answer options:\n\n(A) De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\nThis option is not supported by the text. There is no mention of African slavery in either source, and de las Casas' book is focused on the mistreatment of the indigenous people of the Americas, not the start of African slavery.\n\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\nThis option is partially correct. Columbus's letter is written from his perspective, and it's clear that he has a positive view of himself and his actions. However, this does not necessarily explain the differences between the interactions described in the two sources.\n\n(C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\nThis option is not supported by the text. While Columbus describes the natives as being generous and willing to trade, he also mentions that he himself gave them \"many beautiful and acceptable articles\" and that he wanted to establish a positive relationship with them. This does not suggest that his men were significantly nicer to the natives than later expeditions.\n\n(D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.\nThis option is correct. De las Casas' book is a critique of the Spanish treatment of the indigenous people, and he argues that the Spanish should leave the Americas and cease their oppressive actions.\n\nTherefore, the best answer for the question \"Which of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\" is option (D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.",
