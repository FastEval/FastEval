            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The balance the Supreme Court has struck between the establishment clause and the free-exercise clause can be best described as:\n\n(D) State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The establishment clause prohibits the government from establishing a national religion or favoring one religion over another.\n2. The free-exercise clause guarantees the freedom to practice one's religion without interference from the government.\n3. The Supreme Court has interpreted these clauses to mean that the government cannot force individuals to participate in religious activities or promote religious beliefs, but individuals have the right to practice their religion freely as long as they do not harm others.\n4. In the case of school prayer, the Supreme Court has ruled that state-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, as it violates the establishment clause by promoting religious beliefs and forcing students to participate in religious activities.\n5. However, the Court has also ruled that voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed, as it does not violate the establishment clause and does not force anyone to participate in religious activities against their will.\n\nTherefore, option (D) State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed best describes the balance the Supreme Court has struck between the establishment clause and the free-exercise clause.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

            "model_answer": "Let's examine each statement:\n\n(A) Registered voters between the ages of 35 and 45 are more likely to vote than are those under the age of 21.\n\nThis statement is generally accurate. According to data from the United States Election Project, voters between the ages of 35 and 44 have historically had higher voter turnout rates than younger voters. In the 2020 presidential election, for example, 53.4% of eligible voters aged 35-44 voted, compared to 43.1% of eligible voters aged 18-24.\n\n(B) A registered voter who has attained his or her General Educational Development (GED) is less likely to vote than a high school dropout.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, GED recipients have similar voter turnout rates to high school graduates. In fact, the study found that in the 2016 presidential election, GED recipients had a slightly higher voter turnout rate than high school graduates (54.1% vs. 52.7%).\n\n(C) Registered voters are more likely to vote in general elections than they are in primary elections.\n\nThis statement is accurate. According to data from the United States Election Project, voter turnout is typically higher in general elections than in primary elections. In the 2020 presidential election, for example, 63.1% of eligible voters cast ballots in the general election, compared to 28.5% in the primary elections.\n\n(D) More women than men have voted in every presidential election since 1980.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While it is true that women have historically voted at higher rates than men in recent presidential elections, this has not been the case in every presidential election since 1980. In the 1984 presidential election, for example, men had a slightly higher voter turnout rate than women (55.1% vs. 54.2%).\n\nTherefore, the statement that does NOT accurately describe voting behavior in the United States is:\n\n(D) More women than men have voted in every presidential election since 1980.\n\nThe answer is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "When it comes to forming a child's political views, there are several factors that can play a significant role. However, the most substantial influence is often the child's family.\n\nThe family is the child's first and most significant socialization experience. The child learns about values, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors from their family members. Children often adopt the political views of their parents or caregivers, as they are exposed to their ideologies and discussions from a young age.\n\nAdditionally, families often have discussions about current events, political issues, and social topics, which can shape a child's understanding and opinions. The child may also observe their family's political behaviors, such as voting, volunteering, or activism, which can further influence their political beliefs.\n\nWhile the geographical area in which a child grows up can expose them to diverse perspectives and ideas, the influence of the family is more direct and personal. The media to which a child is exposed can also play a role, but it is often filtered through the family's values and beliefs.\n\nLastly, a child's religion can also shape their political views, but it is not as significant as the influence of the family. Religious beliefs can sometimes align with political ideologies, but they are not always directly linked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) The child's family.\n\n(B)",

            "model_answer": "The Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, established the United States of America as a sovereign nation and provided a framework of government for the newly independent states. The Constitution, adopted in 1787, replaced the Articles of Confederation and established a federal system of government with three branches and a system of checks and balances.\n\nThe question asks what power was granted to the states by the Articles of Confederation but not by the Constitution. To answer this question, we need to examine the provisions of both documents.\n\nThe Articles of Confederation granted the states several powers, including:\n\n* Coining money (Article 9)\n* Appealing to the president to adjudicate disputes (Article 14)\n* Having representation in Congress (Article 4)\n\nOn the other hand, the Constitution grants the federal government several powers that were not granted to the states by the Articles of Confederation, including:\n\n* Authorizing constitutional amendments (Article V)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Authorizing constitutional amendments. This power was granted to the federal government by the Constitution but not by the Articles of Confederation.\n\nSo, the answer is (B).",

Removal from office by the appointing president: This is not a possibility, as federal judges are appointed for life and can only be removed through impeachment and conviction by Congress.\n3. Removal from office by the president-elect: This is not a possibility, as the president-elect does not have the authority to remove federal judges from office.\n4. Recall elections by citizens residing in the district over which the judge has jurisdiction: This is not a possibility, as federal judges are not elected and do not have a specific district or constituency that can recall them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Impeachment, conviction, and removal from office by Congress.\n\n(A)",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n(A) The amount of coverage the issue receives in the major news media: This factor could influence the salience of a political issue, but it's not the defining characteristic. The amount of coverage an issue receives in the media can be influenced by various factors such as the media outlet's bias, the audience's interest, and the level of conflict or drama associated with the issue. However, coverage alone doesn't determine the salience of an issue.\n\n(B) The degree to which public opinion on the issue is likely to shift quickly: This factor could also influence the salience of a political issue, but it's not the defining characteristic either. Public opinion can shift quickly due to various factors such as new information, changing societal attitudes, or political campaigns. However, the speed of public opinion shift alone doesn't determine the salience of an issue.\n\n(C) The number of people affected by the issue: Now we're getting closer! The number of people affected by an issue can certainly contribute to its salience. The more people an issue affects, the more important it is likely to be to the public and to policymakers. However, it's not the only factor that determines salience.\n\n(D) The importance of the issue to a particular individual or group: Bingo! This is the defining characteristic of salience. The importance of an issue to a particular individual or group determines its salience. If an issue is critical to a group's interests or values, it will be more salient to them than an issue that affects a larger number of people but is less relevant to their interests or values.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) The importance of the issue to a particular individual or group.\n\n(D)",

The question asks about voters who rely exclusively on television network news coverage of national elections.\n2. Television network news coverage typically focuses on the most sensational and attention-grabbing stories, rather than providing in-depth analysis of candidates' positions on various issues.\n3. Therefore, voters who rely exclusively on television network news coverage are likely to have a limited understanding of the candidates' positions on domestic and international issues.\n4. However, television network news coverage often does cover candidates' endorsements from special interest groups, as well as public opinion polls.\n5. Thus, the best answer is (A) which special interest groups have endorsed which candidates, followed by (B) the relative strength of each candidate's support, as indicated by public opinion polls.\n6.

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Marbury v. Madison is a landmark case in American history that has had a significant impact on the country's legal system. The case involved a dispute between William Marbury, who was appointed by President John Adams as a justice of the peace, and James Madison, who was the Secretary of State at the time. Marbury had been granted a commission by Adams, but Madison refused to recognize it, arguing that the commission was not properly signed.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard the case and ultimately ruled in favor of Marbury, establishing the principle of judicial review. This means that the Supreme Court has the power to review and interpret the Constitution, and to determine whether laws passed by Congress are in line with the Constitution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Judicial review.\n\nSo, the answer is (C).",
