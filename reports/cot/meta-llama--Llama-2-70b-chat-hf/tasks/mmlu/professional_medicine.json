            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The patient's symptoms and examination results suggest that she is experiencing abnormal labor. This can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n1. Braxton Hicks contractions: These are practice contractions that occur in the third trimester and are often painless. However, the patient is experiencing active labor, which means Braxton Hicks contractions are unlikely.\n2. Lower uterine retroversion: This is a condition where the lower part of the uterus is pulled back and away from the birth canal, making it difficult for the baby to move down. The examination results do not show any reason for obstructed labor, so this diagnosis is less likely.\n3. Hypotonic uterine dysfunction: This occurs when the muscles of the uterus are not contracting properly, leading to weak or no contractions. The patient has received medication for pain, which could suggest that she is experiencing hypotonic uterine dysfunction.\n4. Primary dysfunctional labor: This is a condition where the uterus is not contracting properly, leading to a slow or failed labor. The patient's history of regular contractions and the fact that the fetal head is engaged suggest that this diagnosis is less likely.\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms and examination results, the most likely diagnosis is (C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction.\n\nAnswer: (C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction.",

            "question": "A 9-year-old boy is brought to the office by his parents for a well-child examination. The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?\n\n(A) Atrial fibrillation\n(B) Cor pulmonale\n(C) Systemic hypertension\n(D) Tricuspid valve regurgitation",

            "model_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for (B) Cor pulmonale.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The patient has a history of pneumonia at age 3, which suggests that he may have had a serious respiratory infection in the past.\n2. The patient's vital signs show a moderate systolic murmur, which could indicate left ventricular hypertrophy.\n3. The patient's femoral pulses are weak, which could indicate peripheral artery disease.\n4. The patient's chest x-ray shows mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence, which could indicate left ventricular hypertrophy.\n5. The patient's ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy, which could indicate that the left ventricle is working harder to pump blood due to coronary artery disease or other conditions.\n6. The patient's history of immigration and lack of recent medical evaluation suggest that he may not have received adequate medical care in the past, which could have led to a delay in diagnosis and treatment of any medical conditions.\n\nTherefore, based on the patient's medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests, the most likely complication he is at risk for is Cor pulmonale, which is a condition where the right ventricle of the heart becomes enlarged due to an increase in blood flow and pressure in the lungs. This can lead to shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs and feet.\n\nAnswer: (B) Cor pulmonale.",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's look at the given information:\n* Six healthy subjects participate in a study of muscle metabolism during which hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia is induced.\n* Muscle biopsy specimens obtained from the subjects during the resting state show significantly increased concentrations of malonyl-CoA.\n2. Next, let's consider the possible answer options:\n* (A) Fatty acid oxidation\n* (B) Fatty acid synthesis\n* (C) Gluconeogenesis\n* (D) Glycogenolysis\n3. Based on the information given, we can deduce that the increased malonyl-CoA concentration likely inhibits a process related to glucose metabolism, since hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia are induced during the study.\n4. Option (C) Gluconeogenesis is a process by which glucose is synthesized from non-carbohydrate sources such as lactate, glycerol, and the amino acids. Since gluconeogenesis is not directly related to the metabolism of glucose from carbohydrates, it is less likely to be inhibited by the increased malonyl-CoA concentration.\n5. Option (D) Glycogenolysis, on the other hand, is the breakdown of glycogen to glucose, which is directly related to glucose metabolism. The increased malonyl-CoA concentration could potentially inhibit glycogenolysis by inhibiting the enzyme glycogen phosphatase, which is involved in the breakdown of glycogen.\n6. Therefore, the best answer is (D) Glycogenolysis.\n\nAnd that's my reasoning! The answer is (D) Glycogenolysis.",

The patient's symptoms of crying all the time and refusing to get out of bed suggest that she may be experiencing depression or anxiety.\n2. The patient has a history of major depressive disorder, which increases her risk of suicidal ideation.\n3. The patient's pain rating of 1 to 2 on a 10-point scale suggests that she may not be experiencing significant physical pain, which could indicate that her symptoms are more related to mental health than physical discomfort.\n4.
