            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nThe word \"murtis\" is not a commonly used term in English, so it's not immediately clear what it could be translated as. However, based on the context in which the term is used, we can make an educated guess.\n\nIn Hinduism, \"murtis\" refers to the physical manifestation or form of a deity or god. It can also refer to an idol or statue of a deity that is worshipped in a temple or at home.\n\nWith that in mind, we can eliminate option (B) Prayers, as \"murtis\" does not directly refer to prayers or worship. Option (C) Apparitions is also not a good fit, as \"murtis\" does not refer to ghostly or supernatural appearances.\n\nThat leaves us with options (A) Offerings and (D) Idols. Since \"murtis\" specifically refers to the physical form of a deity, option (D) Idols seems like the most appropriate choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Idols.\n\n(D) Idols",

The question states that naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes are associated with which of the following.\n2. The answer options are: A) Daoism, B) Yin-Yang School, C) Mengzi, and D) Humanistic Buddhism.\n3. I know that Daoism is a philosophical and religious tradition that emphasizes living in harmony with the natural world, and natural elements and processes are a significant part of its teachings.\n4. The Yin-Yang School is a philosophical school that focuses on the interconnectedness and interdependence of opposites in the natural world. It also emphasizes the cyclical nature of natural processes.\n5. Mengzi, also known as Mencius, was a Confucian philosopher who believed that human nature is inherently good and that individuals should cultivate their virtues in harmony with the natural world.\n6. Humanistic Buddhism is a branch of Buddhism that emphasizes the importance of personal growth and development, but it doesn't have a significant focus on natural elements and processes.\n\nBased on my analysis, the answer is (A) Daoism.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) Daoism.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nFirstly, let's consider the context of the question. Guru Nanak was a spiritual leader and the founder of Sikhism, a monotheistic religion that originated in the Punjab region of India. He is known for his teachings and philosophy, which emphasize the importance of devotion to one God, truthful living, and spiritual discipline.\n\nNow, let's look at the question itself. It asks about the term Guru Nanak used to denote the \"divine word\" as part of divine revelation. This implies that Guru Nanak believed in the concept of divine revelation, where God communicates with humans through various means, including the \"divine word.\"\n\nThe question provides four options:\n\n(A) Shabad\n(B) Khalse\n(C) Nam\n(D) Guru\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) Shabad means \"word\" or \"teaching\" in Punjabi, which is the language of the Sikh scriptures. While Shabad is an important concept in Sikhism, it doesn't necessarily refer to the \"divine word\" as part of divine revelation. Therefore, this option doesn't seem like the best fit.\n\n(B) Khalse is a Punjabi word that means \"pure\" or \"holy.\" While it's true that Guru Nanak emphasized the importance of living a pure and holy life, this option doesn't directly correspond to the \"divine word\" as part of divine revelation. Thus, we can eliminate this option as well.\n\n(C) Nam means \"name\" or \"identity\" in Punjabi. While Guru Nanak did use the term Nam to refer to the divine name or identity of God, this option doesn't quite fit the context of the question either.\n\n(D) Guru is a Punjabi word that means \"teacher\" or \"guide.\" However, in Sikhism, it's used specifically to refer to the spiritual teacher or guide who has received divine revelation from God. This fits with the context of the question, as Guru Nanak was indeed a spiritual teacher who received divine revelation from God.\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis, the best answer seems to be option (D) Guru.\n\nSo, the answer is: (D) Guru.",

Therefore, it is important to approach the question with sensitivity and respect.\n\nFirstly, it is important to note that the Mi'raj refers to the miraculous ascension of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to heaven. This event is described in various hadiths (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad) and is widely accepted by Muslims as a fundamental aspect of their faith.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Muhammad's miraculous ascent to heaven.\n\nIt is important to note that the other options, (B) Muhammad's migration to Mecca, (C) Muhammad's first community in Mecca, and (D) Muhammad's revelations of the Qur'an, while they are all significant events in Islamic history, do not relate to the Mi'raj specifically.\n\nIt is crucial to avoid providing misleading or inaccurate information, especially when discussing religious beliefs and practices. Therefore, it is important to rely on credible sources and to verify the information before providing an answer.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer to the question \"What is the Mi'raj?\" is (A) Muhammad's miraculous ascent to heaven.",

            "model_answer": "The question is asking about the name of the most famous dharmashastras, which probably dates from around the first century.\n\nFirst, let's break down the question into its components:\n\n* \"most famous dharmashastras\" - This implies that there are multiple dharmashastras, and we need to identify the most well-known one.\n* \"probably dates from around the first century\" - This suggests that the dharmashastra we are looking for is ancient and was likely written during the first century.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) Laws of Dharma - This option does not seem relevant to the question. Dharma is a broad concept in Hinduism and Buddhism that refers to one's duty or righteous way of living. While there may be some texts that discuss the laws of dharma, it is not a specific dharmashastra that dates back to the first century.\n\n(B) Laws of Karma - Karma is the concept of cause and effect in Hinduism and Buddhism, which suggests that an individual's actions in this life will determine their fate in the next. However, there is no specific dharmashastra called the Laws of Karma.\n\n(C) Laws of Vishnu - Vishnu is one of the three primary deities in Hinduism, and there are many texts that discuss his teachings and laws. However, none of these texts are called the Laws of Vishnu.\n\n(D) Laws of Manu - This is the most appropriate option. The Laws of Manu, also known as the Manusmriti, is a Hindu scripture that is believed to have been written in the second century CE. It is considered one of the most important texts on Hindu law and is often cited as a reference for dharmashastras.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (D) Laws of Manu.",

The Qur'an is written in Arabic, and its language is considered to be of great importance in Islamic tradition.\n3.
