This is correct, as the Barkhausen criterion states that the loop gain should be unity for the oscillator to be stable.\n\nOption B states that the loop gain should be less than unity. This is incorrect, as a loop gain of less than unity would result in a stable oscillator, but not the most stable oscillator.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate options C and D\nOption C states that the phase of a feedback signal with respect to input should be 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0. This is incorrect, as the Barkhausen criterion does not mention anything about the phase of the feedback signal.\n\nOption D states that both options A and C are correct.

The question is asking about the advantage of using a potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement over direct measurement using a voltmeter.\n2. Option (A) suggests that the potentiometer method loads the circuit moderately, which may improve the accuracy of the measurement by avoiding excessive loading of the circuit. However, this is not the best answer.\n3. Option (B) implies that the potentiometer method loads the circuit to its maximum extent, which may cause inaccuracy in the measurement due to the increased load. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n4. Option (C) mentions the use of a centre zero galvanometer instead of a voltmeter, which is irrelevant to the question.\n5. Option (D) states that the potentiometer method does not load the circuit at all, which is the most accurate answer. By not loading the circuit, the potentiometer method does not affect the voltage being measured, resulting in a more accurate reading.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) It does not load the circuit at all.",

The two infinite parallel metal plates are charged with equal surface charge density of the same polarity. This means that the charge distribution on each plate is uniform and constant.\n2. The electric field between the plates is defined as the force per unit charge at a given point in space. Since the charge distribution is uniform and constant, the electric field between the plates will also be constant.\n3. Since the two plates are parallel and infinite, the electric field between them will be parallel to the plates and directed towards or away from the plates, depending on the polarity of the charge.\n4.
