            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's calculate the daily revenue of the limousine:\n\nDaily Revenue = Hourly Rate x Number of Hours per Day\nDaily Revenue = $245 x 2\nDaily Revenue = $490\n2. Next, let's calculate the daily cost of running the limousine:\n\nDaily Cost = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost\nDaily Cost = $50 + ($245 x 2)\nDaily Cost = $50 + $490\nDaily Cost = $540\n3. Now, let's calculate the yearly revenue of the limousine:\n\nYearly Revenue = Daily Revenue x Number of Days per Year\nYearly Revenue = $490 x 365\nYearly Revenue = $178,350\n4. Finally, let's calculate the yearly yield on your investment:\n\nYearly Yield = (Yearly Revenue - Yearly Cost) / Initial Investment\nYearly Yield = ($178,350 - $540) / $98,000\nYearly Yield = 164%\n\nSo, the estimated yearly yield on your investment is 164%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 164%.",

            "model_answer": "Thank you for your question. I understand that you want me to explain my reasoning step-by-step before outputting the answer.\n\nFirstly, let's analyze the situation: Arno Co. did not record a credit purchase of merchandise made prior to year end, but the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory.\n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that the merchandise was not recorded as a current asset (such as Accounts Receivable) or a current liability (such as Accounts Payable) on Arno's balance sheet at year end.\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of this omission on Arno's balance sheet at year end:\n\nAssets:\n\n* The omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise did not affect Arno's assets. The merchandise was included in the year-end physical inventory, which means that it was already recorded as an asset on the balance sheet. Therefore, there is no effect on assets.\n\nLiabilities:\n\n* The omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise resulted in an understatement of Arno's liabilities. The merchandise was not recorded as a current liability (such as Accounts Payable), which means that Arno's liabilities were understated at year end.\n\nNow, based on the above analysis, we can answer the question:\n\nThe correct answer is (D) Understated Understated.\n\nTherefore, the effect of the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise on Arno's balance sheet at year end was that both assets and liabilities were understated.\n\nI hope this step-by-step explanation helps you understand the reasoning behind the answer.

            "model_answer": "The question is asking about the impact of an error in amortizing a premium bond on the bond carrying amount and retained earnings at June 30 year 12.\n\nFirst, let's examine the correct method for amortizing the premium. The effective interest method is the appropriate method to use in this case, as it takes into account the time value of money and provides a more accurate representation of the bond's interest expense over its term.\n\nNext, let's consider the impact of using the incorrect method (straight-line method) on the bond carrying amount and retained earnings. When the straight-line method is used, the bond premium is amortized evenly over the bond's term, resulting in a constant interest expense each period. However, this method does not account for the fact that the bond's interest expense decreases over time, as the bond's face value decreases.\n\nAs a result, using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method will result in an overstatement of interest expense and a lower carrying amount of the bond on the balance sheet. This is because the straight-line method does not take into account the decreasing interest expense over time, leading to a higher interest expense being recorded in the early years of the bond's term.\n\nTherefore, the bond carrying amount will be overstated, as the straight-line method will have recorded a higher interest expense than the effective interest method. Additionally, retained earnings will also be understated, as the overstated interest expense will reduce the net income, which in turn reduces retained earnings.\n\nNow, let's match the answer choices to the conclusions we have reached:\n\n(A) Overstated Understated - This matches our conclusion that the bond carrying amount is overstated, and retained earnings are understated.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Overstated Understated.\n\nThe final answer is:\n(A)",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the present value of the bond's future cash flows. We can use the formula for the present value of a bond:\n\nPV = CF / (1 + y)^n\n\nwhere:\n\nPV = present value\nCF = coupon payment (face value x coupon rate)\ny = yield to maturity\nn = number of periods until maturity\n\nIn this case, the coupon payment is $100 x 5% = $5. The yield to maturity is 6%. The bond has a face value of $100 and matures in 3 years, so there are 3 periods until maturity.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the present value:\n\nPV = $5 / (1 + 0.06)^3\nPV = $4.29\n\nNext, we need to calculate the bond's price. The price of a bond is equal to its present value plus the present value of the bond's future cash flows. In this case, the present value of the bond's future cash flows is:\n\nPV of future cash flows = PV of bond - PV of first coupon payment\nPV of future cash flows = $4.29 - $5\nPV of future cash flows = -$0.71\n\nThe bond's price is then:\n\nPrice = PV of bond + PV of future cash flows\nPrice = $4.29 - $0.71\nPrice = $3.58\n\nFinally, we can compare the bond's price to the given options:\n\nOption A: $100\nOption B: $104.29\nOption C: $96.71\nOption D: $97.33\n\nThe correct answer is Option C: $96.71.\n\nTherefore, the price of a three-year bond (face value $100), paying 5% coupons, with a yield of 6% is $96.71.\n\n(C) $96.71",

            "model_answer": "My reasoning is as follows:\n\n(A) It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale: This statement is correct. When a company intends to sell a building, it should be classified as an asset held for sale, as it is no longer being used for operational purposes and is being actively marketed for sale.\n\n(B) It will be classified as a current asset: This statement is incorrect. A building is typically classified as a non-current asset, as it is a long-term asset that is not expected to be converted into cash within one year. Even though the company expects to complete the sale in four months, it is still considered a non-current asset until the sale is finalized.\n\n(C) It will no longer be depreciated: This statement is correct.

The old building should be valued at its fair value less costs to sell, which may be different from its historical cost. The fair value less costs to sell is the amount that the company expects to receive from the sale of the building, and it may have changed since the building was first purchased.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) It will be classified as a current asset.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

            "model_answer": "My reasoning for this question is as follows:\n\n1. first, we need to determine the taxable income of the S corporation. Since the C corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income, we can assume that the S corporation would have also had the same taxable income.\n2. Next, we need to calculate the total distributions made by the S corporation. Since the C corporation distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends, we can assume that the S corporation would have distributed a similar amount, proportional to the number of shares owned by each shareholder.\n3. Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock of the C corporation, so we can assume that they would have received 40% of the total distributions made by the S corporation.\n4. To calculate the amount of income that Carson would have reported on their individual tax return, we need to subtract the amount of distributions they received from their share of the taxable income.\n5.
