            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily revenue of the limousine:\n\n$245 per hour x 2 hours per day = $490 per day\n\nNext, let's calculate the daily cost of the limousine:\n\n$50 per day\n\nNow, let's calculate the yearly revenue of the limousine:\n\n$490 per day x 365 days per year = $178,350 per year\n\nAnd finally, let's calculate the yearly yield on your investment:\n\n$178,350 per year - $98,000 (original investment) = $80,350 per year\n\nNow, we need to convert the yearly yield to a percentage. To do this, we divide the yearly yield by the original investment:\n\n$80,350 per year \u00f7 $98,000 (original investment) = 0.82, or 82%\n\nSo, the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, including any festivities and weekends, is 82%.\n\nNow, let's look at the answer choices:\n\n(A) 164% - This is much higher than our calculated yearly yield of 82%, so this is not the correct answer.\n\n(B) 1.64% - This is a very low percentage, much lower than our calculated yearly yield of 82%, so this is not the correct answer.\n\n(C) 0.45% - This is an even lower percentage, much lower than our calculated yearly yield of 82%, so this is not the correct answer.\n\n(D) 183% - This is a higher percentage than our calculated yearly yield of 82%, but it's still not the correct answer.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B) 1.64%.\n\nI hope this explanation helps!",

The merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory, which means that it was part of the company's assets at the end of the year.\n2. However, the credit purchase of the merchandise was not recorded prior to year end, which means that the company did not have a corresponding liability for the purchase.\n3. Since the merchandise was included in the physical inventory, it should have been recorded as an asset on the balance sheet.\n4.

The options are:\n\t* A) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\t* B) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\n\t* C) Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\n\t* D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\n3. Let's examine each option closely:\n\t* A) This option is correct. Nonsampling risk is a risk that arises when an auditor uses a sample to make conclusions about a population, and there is a possibility that the conclusions might be different if the auditor had tested every item in the population.\n\t* B) This option is incorrect. Nonsampling risk is not related to the auditor's failure to recognize misstatements.\n\t* C) This option is incorrect. Sampling risk is related to the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks, but it is not the correct answer for nonissuers.\n\t* D) This option is incorrect. Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective, but it is not the correct answer for nonissuers.\n4.

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. The question states that the auditor is concerned with subsequent events, which means events that occur after the year end.\n2. Option (A) does not relate to subsequent events, as it refers to inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end. This is a matter of timing and does not concern the auditor's responsibility for subsequent events.\n3. Option (B) also does not relate to subsequent events, as it refers to internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate. While the auditor may need to follow up on previous findings, this is not specifically related to subsequent events.\n4. Option (D) is not the best answer, as comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited is not directly related to subsequent events. While the auditor may need to review interim financial statements as part of their audit, this is not the primary concern for subsequent events.\n5. Option (C) is the best answer, as it directly relates to the auditor's responsibility for subsequent events. Reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end helps the auditor to identify any material transactions or events that occurred after the year end and ensure that they are properly accounted for and disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the present value of the future cash flows. We have two cash flows: one in year 5 and one in year 10.\n2. The present value of a cash flow is calculated using the formula: PV = CF / (1 + r)^n, where CF is the cash flow, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of years until the cash flow.\n3. In this case, the discount rate is 10%, so we can use that value for r. The number of years until the first cash flow is 5, and the number of years until the second cash flow is 10.\n4. For the first cash flow, we have: PV1 = $500 / (1 + 0.10)^5 = $377.78\n5. For the second cash flow, we have: PV2 = $500 / (1 + 0.10)^10 = $204.62\n6. Now, we add up the present values of the two cash flows to get the total NPV: NPV = PV1 + PV2 = $377.78 + $204.62 = $582.40\n7. Finally, we compare the NPV to the initial investment cost of $500. Since the NPV is greater than the initial cost, the project is viable and will generate a positive return.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) $377.78.\n\nI hope that helps!

Specifically, the error was made by Dean Co. when they used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the premium on bonds issued on July 1 year 7.\n\nNow, let's break down the answer choices:\n\nA) Overstated Understated: This choice suggests that the carrying amount of bonds and retained earnings were both overstated due to the error. However, this doesn't make sense because the error in amortization would have understated the carrying amount of bonds, not overstated it.\n\nB) Understated Overstated: This choice suggests that the carrying amount of bonds was understated due to the error, while retained earnings were overstated. This is incorrect because the error in amortization would have understated both the carrying amount of bonds and retained earnings.\n\nC) Overstated No effect: This choice suggests that the carrying amount of bonds was overstated due to the error, but retained earnings were not affected. This is incorrect because the error in amortization would have understated both the carrying amount of bonds and retained earnings.\n\nD) No effect No effect: This choice suggests that the error in amortization had no impact on the carrying amount of bonds or retained earnings. This is incorrect because the error would have understated both the carrying amount of bonds and retained earnings.\n\nNow that we've analyzed the answer choices, let's determine the correct answer:\n\nThe correct answer is (B) Understated Overstated.\n\nThe error in amortization using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method would have understated the carrying amount of bonds and overstated retained earnings.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Understated Overstated.\n\n(B)",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the present value of the bond's future cash flows. We can use the formula for present value of a bond:\n\nPV = (Face Value / (1 + Yield)^Years) + (Coupon Payments / (1 + Yield)^(Years - 1))\n\nIn this case, the face value of the bond is $100, the yield is 6%, and the bond has a maturity of 3 years. The coupon payments are 5% of the face value, which is $5 per year.\n2. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nPV = ($100 / (1 + 0.06)^3) + ($5 / (1 + 0.06)^(3 - 1))\nPV = $94.29 + $4.29\nPV = $98.58\n3. Now, we need to calculate the price of the bond. The price of a bond is the present value of its future cash flows, minus any accrued interest. Since the bond has a face value of $100, and the present value of its future cash flows is $98.58, the price of the bond would be:\n\nPrice = $98.58 - $1.42 (accrued interest)\nPrice = $97.16\n4. Therefore, the answer is (D) $97.33.\n\nSo, the price of a three-year bond with a face value of $100, paying 5% coupons, and a yield of 6% is approximately $97.33.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The company has moved to a new building, and the old building is being actively marketed for sale. This means that the old building is no longer being used by the company and is now being treated as an asset held for sale.\n2. As an asset held for sale, the old building should be classified as a non-current asset, rather than a current asset. This is because the company does not plan to sell the building within the next 12 months, and it is not considered a current asset.\n3. Since the old building is no longer being used by the company, it should no longer be depreciated. Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, and since the old building is no longer being used, it does not have a useful life.\n4. The company expects to complete the sale of the old building in four months. This means that the old building should be valued at its fair value, which is the amount that the company expects to receive from the sale.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct answer is (D) It will be valued at historical cost. The historical cost of an asset is the amount that was paid to acquire it, and since the company has not yet sold the old building, it should still be valued at its historical cost.\n\nSo, the answer is (D) It will be valued at historical cost.",

S corporations are pass-through entities, meaning that the corporation's income, deductions, and credits pass through to the shareholders, who report them on their individual tax returns.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock of the C corporation.\n2. The corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income.\n3. The corporation distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders.\n4. Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson's individual tax return.\n\nIf the corporation had been an S corporation, the distributions to the owners would have been proportionate. This means that Carson, as a 40% shareholder, would have received 40% of the total distributions, which is $28,000 (40% of $70,000).\n\nHowever, S corporations do not pay dividends; instead, they distribute the income to the shareholders, who report it on their individual tax returns. Therefore, the $28,000 that Carson received in dividends would not be taxable as dividend income.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the amount of income that Carson would have reported on Carson's individual tax return if the corporation had been an S corporation. Since the corporation had taxable income of $400,000, Carson's share of the taxable income would be $160,000 (40% of $400,000).\n\nHowever, Carson already reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson's individual tax return. Therefore, the additional amount of income that Carson would have reported if the corporation had been an S corporation is $132,000 ($160,000 - $28,000).\n\nSo, the answer is (B) $132,000.\n\nTherefore, if the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate, Carson would have reported $132,000 in income on Carson's individual tax return.",
