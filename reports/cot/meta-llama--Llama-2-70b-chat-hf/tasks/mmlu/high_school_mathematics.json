We need to reflect this pentagon across the line y = x to get a new pentagon, P'.\n\nNow, when we reflect a shape across a line, the new shape will have the same vertices, but the coordinates of those vertices will be swapped. In other words, the x-coordinates of the original shape will become the y-coordinates of the reflected shape, and vice versa.\n\nSo, let's look at the vertices of the original pentagon P:\n\n* Vertex 1: (-2, -4)\n* Vertex 2: (-4, 1)\n* Vertex 3: (-1, 4)\n* Vertex 4: (2, 4)\n* Vertex 5: (3, 0)\n\nIf we reflect this pentagon across the line y = x, we get the following coordinates for the vertices of the new pentagon P':\n\n* Vertex 1: (-2, 4)\n* Vertex 2: (-4, 1)\n* Vertex 3: (1, 4)\n* Vertex 4: (4, 2)\n* Vertex 5: (0, 3)\n\nNow, we need to find which vertex of P' corresponds to the given options:\n\n(A) (0, \u20133)\n(B) (4, 1)\n(C) (2, 2)\n(D) (\u20134, \u20132)\n\nLet's compare each option with the coordinates of the vertices of P':\n\n(A) (0, \u20133)\n\nThis option does not match any of the vertices of P'.

The length of a rectangle is twice its width, so if the width is w, the length is 2w.\n2. The diagonal of a rectangle is the distance from one corner to the opposite corner. In this case, the diagonal is given as 5\u221a5.\n3. To find the area of a rectangle, we need to multiply the length by the width. So, the area of this rectangle would be (2w) \\* w = 2w^2.\n4. Now, we can substitute the value of the diagonal into the equation. We know that the diagonal is 5\u221a5, so we can use that to find the width. The width is half the length, so the width is 2w. Therefore, we can write:\n\n2w^2 = 5\u221a5\n\n5. Now, we can simplify the equation. The square root of 5 is approximately 2.236, so we can write:\n\n2w^2 = 5 x 2.236\n\n6. Now, we can solve for w. We get:\n\n2w^2 = 11.18\n\nw^2 = 11.18 / 2\n\nw^2 = 5.59\n\n7. Now, we can take the square root of both sides:\n\nw = sqrt(5.59)\n\nw = 2.36\n\n8. Now that we have found the width, we can find the length. The length is twice the width, so:\n\nlength = 2w\n\nlength = 2(2.36)\n\nlength = 4.72\n\n9. Finally, we can find the area of the rectangle:\n\narea = length \\* width\n\narea = 4.72 \\* 2.36\n\narea = 11.07\n\n10. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is approximately 11.07.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) 50.",
