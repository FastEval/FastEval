First, let's visualize the original pentagon P with vertices at (\u2013 2, \u2013 4), (\u2013 4, 1), (\u20131, 4), (2, 4), and (3, 0).\n2. Next, let's reflect the pentagon across the line y = x to get the new pentagon P'.\n3. To do this, we need to switch the coordinates of each vertex. So, the vertex at (\u2013 2, \u2013 4) becomes (\u2013 2, 4), the vertex at (\u2013 4, 1) becomes (4, \u2013 1), and so on.\n4. Using this method, we can find the coordinates of the vertices of P' as follows:\n* Vertex 1: (\u2013 2, \u2013 4) -> (\u2013 2, 4)\n* Vertex 2: (\u2013 4, 1) -> (4, \u2013 1)\n* Vertex 3: (\u20131, 4) -> (1, 4)\n* Vertex 4: (2, 4) -> (2, \u2013 4)\n* Vertex 5: (3, 0) -> (3, 0)\n5.

The length of a rectangle is twice its width, so we can let the width be \"w\" and the length be \"2w\".\n2. The diagonal of a rectangle is the square root of the sum of the squares of the length and width. In this case, the diagonal is given as $5\\sqrt{5}$, so we can set up the equation:\n\n$$5\\sqrt{5} = \\sqrt{(\\text{length})^2 + (\\text{width})^2}$$\n\n3.

What is a prime factor?\nA prime factor is a factor that is itself prime (i.e., divisible only by 1 and itself). For example, the prime factors of 30 are 2, 3, and 5, because those are the only factors that divide 30 without leaving a remainder.\n2.

At each meal, Joe randomly chooses with equal probabilities either an apple, an orange, or a banana to eat.\n3. There are three possible choices for each meal: apple, orange, or banana.\n4. For the first meal, the probability that Joe chooses a particular fruit (e.g. apple) is 1/3.\n5. For the second meal, the probability that Joe chooses a different fruit from the first meal is 2/3, since there are two remaining options (orange or banana) out of three total options.\n6.

The probability that Joe eats at least two different kinds of fruit in a day is the probability that he chooses a different fruit for at least two of the three meals.\n8. Using the probabilities calculated in steps 4-6, we can calculate the probability that Joe eats at least two different kinds of fruit as follows:\n\nP(at least two different fruits) = P(different fruit for first two meals) \\* P(different fruit for third meal)\n= (2/3) \\* (1/2)\n= 1/3\n\nTherefore, the probability that Joe will eat at least two different kinds of fruit on a given day is 1/3.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) \\frac{5}{9}.",

The function $f(x)$ is strictly convex, meaning that for any real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a<b$, the portion of the graph of $y=f(x)$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$ lies below the line segment whose endpoints are $(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$.\n2. We know that $f(x)$ passes through the point $(-2,5)$, so the line segment between $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$ must be below the graph of $y=f(x)$.\n3. The line segment between $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$ has a slope of $m = (9-5)/(2-(-2)) = 4/3$.\n4. Since $f(x)$ is strictly convex, the tangent line to the graph of $y=f(x)$ at any point must have a slope less than or equal to the slope of the line segment between the two points.\n5. Therefore, the tangent line to the graph of $y=f(x)$ at $x=1$ must have a slope less than or equal to $4/3$.\n6. The equation of the tangent line to the graph of $y=f(x)$ at $x=1$ is given by $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n7. Since the tangent line must have a slope less than or equal to $4/3$, we know that $m \\leq 4/3$.\n8.
