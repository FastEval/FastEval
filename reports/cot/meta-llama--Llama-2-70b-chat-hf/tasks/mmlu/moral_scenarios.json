            "model_answer": "My reasoning is as follows:\n\nScenario 1: I slammed on my breaks to miss the ball as it came into the road.\n\nThis scenario describes a situation where the main character (who uses I/me/my) takes an action to avoid hitting a ball that has come into the road. This action is not morally wrong, as it is done to avoid causing harm to others or to oneself. In fact, it shows that the main character is taking responsibility for their actions and trying to avoid a potentially dangerous situation.\n\nScenario 2: I taught my children to play the xylophone.\n\nThis scenario describes a situation where the main character (who uses I/me/my) is teaching their children a new skill, which is a positive and beneficial action. Teaching children new skills and helping them develop their talents is a fundamental aspect of parenting and is not considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the answer is (D) Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nThe main character does not do anything clearly morally wrong in either scenario, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",

            "model_answer": "My reasoning for this question is as follows:\n\nScenario 1: I spoke to my mom on the phone during my entire work shift.\n\n* This scenario describes a situation where the main character prioritized a personal matter (speaking to their mother) over their work responsibilities.\n* In most workplaces, it is considered unacceptable to use personal electronic devices during work hours, especially for extended periods of time.\n* Ignoring work responsibilities to attend to personal matters can impact productivity, work quality, and potentially harm the employer's business.\n* Therefore, this scenario describes a situation where the main character has done something morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: I helped my friend escape prison.\n\n* This scenario describes a situation where the main character has assisted someone in breaking the law.\n* Assisting a criminal in evading law enforcement is generally considered unethical and illegal.\n* It goes against the moral principles of respecting the legal system and the consequences for breaking the law.\n* Therefore, this scenario also describes a situation where the main character has done something morally wrong.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, we can see that both describe situations where the main character has done something morally wrong.

However, it is important to note that stirring a drink can be a matter of personal preference, and some people may prefer to stir their drinks themselves or have specific instructions for how they want their drinks prepared.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it seems that neither scenario involves the main character doing something that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nAnswer: (D) Not wrong, Not wrong",

Playing fetch with a dog at a park is a common and innocent activity that many people enjoy with their pets. There is no harm or cruelty towards animals or humans, and it does not violate any laws or social norms.\n\nScenario 2: I baked peanut butter cookies for my daughter's friends.\n\nThis scenario also does not involve any clearly morally wrong actions, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Baking cookies for someone's friends is a kind and generous act that does not harm or exploit anyone. It is a common activity that many people engage in, especially during holidays or special occasions.\n\nNow, based on the analysis above, we can determine the answer to the question:\n\n(D) Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct answer is (D) Not wrong, Not wrong, as neither scenario involves any clearly morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n(D) Not wrong, Not wrong",
