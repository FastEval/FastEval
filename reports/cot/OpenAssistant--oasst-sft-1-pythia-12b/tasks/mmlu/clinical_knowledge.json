            "model_answer": "The size of a cannula used in a rapid blood transfusion would depend on the patient's size and the need for fast flow of blood. As of 2020, 18- and 20- gauge cannulas are commonly used for this procedure due to their smaller size and ease of use. However, 22- and 24- gauge cannulas may be preferable in certain cases, such as when the patient is very large or if rapid flow of blood is needed to maintain oxygen levels in the blood. It is important to consult with a transfusion professional or healthcare provider to determine the best size cannula for a specific patient.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) HIV infection.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK, but it accounts for only about 10% of cases. The next three causes - cerebrovascular (stroke) disease, Lewy body disease, and Japanese B encephalitis - are also relatively common, affecting approximately 15%, 10%, and 5% of cases, respectively.\n\nHIV infection, on the other hand, is a viral infection that can cause AIDS and other brain and nervous system disorders. It is transmitted through sexual contact and injection drugs use, and it is common in areas with high rates of poverty and sexual violence. In the UK, about 1% of the population has been diagnosed with the virus, and it is estimated that up to 10% of older adults may be carrying the infection but undiagnosed.\n\nThe fact that Lewy body disease and Japanese B encephalitis are both linked to viral infections and that Alzheimer's disease is not suggests that infection may contribute to the development of some types of dementia. However, more research is needed to confirm this link and to understand the exact mechanisms by which infection may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementias.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Option A is incorrect because when the body is in an intense work state (such as during a sprint), there is a high demand for energy that is provided by the breakdown of carbohydrates (via glycolysis) and the release of stored energy in the form of ATP. This increase in energy production can lead to a corresponding increase in the production of lactic acid, which canlower the pH of the muscle and eventually cause muscular fatigue. Option B is also incorrect because the pH of the muscle is not a reliable measure of muscle fatigue or damage. Option C is incorrect because blood glucose concentration is not normally used as a reliable measure of fatigue or damage. Option D is also incorrect because the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism is not a direct measure of fatigue or damage. The final answer is therefore D.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure! Here's the explanation of why answer C is correct.\n\nThe codons in mRNA encoding an amino acid are constructed from four nucleotide bases, which are denoted by their coding symbols. The individualtriplet codons specify the particular amino acid being produced.\n\nFor example, the sequence ATG specifies the amino acid glutamic acid (GLu). This sequence consists of three bases, A, T, and G, in that order. The third base, G, is the start of the coding sequence, and the first two bases, A and T, are frequently referred to as the anticodon.\n\nThe anticodon and the amino acid it codes for are Watson-Crick base-pairing partners, where the first base of the anticodon pairs with the third base of the amino acid, and the second base of the anticodon pairs with the second base of the amino acid.\n\nFor example, the ATG sequence in GLu's coding sequence pairs with the G base of the anticodon (GCA), thereby specifying the translation of the mRNA into the corresponding GLu amino acid.\n\nAlthough it may seem that C and D are functionally equivalent, the amino acids themselves have unique chemical properties and biological roles. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between the four types of codons described above. Coded replication and repair require specific types of codons, and therefore, enzymes that recognize different types of codons are necessary for their function.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is C, because the codons in mRNA specifying an amino acid are constructed from a sequence of three nucleotide bases, and these bases are responsible for specifying the amino acid being produced.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, the correct answer is A.\n\nThiokinase is a enzyme that catalyses the reaction of ATP and ADP to generate energy andakepyntai, which is used by the cell to transport fat molecules into the mitochondria. This reaction requires the participation of CoA, which acts as a cofactor. CoA is loaded onto the fatty acid during its transport into the mitochondria and is then released back into the cell when the fat is used for energy.\n\nAcetyl-CoA is another intermediate in the beta-oxidation offatty acids, but it is not used for energy production. Instead, it is used to convert the fat into carbohydrates through the process of glycolysis. Carnitine is a molecule that is used by the cell to transport fat into the mitochondria. However, it can also be used by the cell for other purposes, such as the metabolism of proteins.\n\nTherefore, A is the correct answer because it is the only enzyme that is involved in the transportation of fat molecules into the mitochondria and uses CoA as a cofactor.",
