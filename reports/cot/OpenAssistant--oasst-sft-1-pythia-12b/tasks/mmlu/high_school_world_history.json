By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

The passage suggests that the rapid diffusion of guns and horses, and the resulting shift in military tactics, led to the decline of Silk Road commerce because these technologies made it easier for territorial states to defend their territories and to engage in warfare with each other, thereby disrupting the traditional system of trade and commerce that had relied on small-scale partnerships and itineraries. By the mid-1500s, European powers, especially Spain and Italy, were beginning to monopolize the trade of luxury goods, which had been the primary source of revenue for the Silk Road commerce network.",

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

            "model_answer": "Based on the text of the passage, it is unclear whether Ghanians engaged in direct or indirect trade with Asia. While the text references a kingdom in which Ghanians spoke a language similar to Arabic, it does not provide any specific information about the presence or absence of trade with Asia. Additionally, there is no evidence that Ghanians used horses or lived in courts similar to those of the Mongols, who were active in trade with Asia. The kow-tow and the adorning oneself with gold and jewelry are traditional Chinese practices, but the text does not suggest that these practices were common in Ghanian court life. Finally, while the text mentions that the people in the king's court wore silk robes, this fact alone does not provide evidence of trade with Asia.\n\nOverall, while the passage mentions the presence of a kingdom in which Ghanians spoke a language similar to Arabic and the presence of certain Chinese traditions, it does not provide sufficient evidence to determine whether Ghanians actively engaged in trade with Asia.",

At the time, Israel was backing the Lebanese terrorist organization Hezbollah, which was engaged in a guerrilla war against the Lebanese government. Israel's strategy in the war was to bomb Lebanon and spread terror among the Lebanese population, while Hezbollah launched rocket attacks against Israeli communities.\n\nAlthough the war ended in August of 1983 with a UN-sponsored ceasefire agreement, the conflict continued to simmer below the surface. Israel and Lebanon remained in a state of war for over a decade, with Hezbollah regularly firing rockets into Israel and the Jewish state sponsoring a military operation in Lebanon aimed at seizing Shebaa Farms, a Shiite-held disputed territory.\n\nIn 2005, Israel finally resolved to withdraw its forces from Lebanon, which was seen as a major step towards ending the conflict. The Israeli government also reached out to Hezbollah, inviting the terrorist organization to join the political process and engage in peace negotiations. In 2008, Hezbollah and Israel signed a peace agreement that included a series ofetted ceasefires and security guarantees for both sides.\n\nIn conclusion, the Arab-Israeli conflict was one of the most significant conflicts of the 20th century and played a critical role in shaping the region's political landscape.

This adjective suggests that Wordsworth viewed the revolution as a moral cause, and that his lyrics convey a sense of sorrow and empathy for the people who lived through the events.\n\nTherefore, in conclusion, I believe that the best adjective to describe the differing perspectives of Charles Dickens and William Wordsworth on the French Revolution is \"optimistic.\"",

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",

Eden massacred a large number of unarmed native villagers in what became known as the \"massacre at Cawnpore\".\n\nThe event was characterized by several factors, including the lack of proper military training and discipline among the British forces, as well as the use of sheer force and disregard for human life. Additionally, the British government frequently mistreated and oppressed the native population, leading to widespread resentment and anger.\n\nIn defense of the British actions at Cawnpore, some argue that the massacre was a response to a sudden and unprovoked attack by the native villagers, who had sought refuge in the British military perimeter. Others argue that the massacre was necessary to maintain law and order in the region and to prevent further bloodshed.\n\nUltimately, the causes and consequences of the Cawnpore Massacre remain a subject of ongoing debate and discussion among historians and scholars. While the event does not represent the sole cause of the Indian independence movement, it serves as a stark reminder of the brutality and oppression inherent in British colonial rule and the need for reform and accountability.\n\nSources:\n\n\"The Cawnpore Massacres,\" Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cawnpore_Massacres \n\"The Cawnpore Massacres Reconsidered,\" Christianity & Society, Vol. 8, No. 1 ( Winter, 1990), pp. 43-70.\n\"Did I Say That?
