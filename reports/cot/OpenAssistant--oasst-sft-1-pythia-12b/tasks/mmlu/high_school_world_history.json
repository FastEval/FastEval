The term pan-asian ideology has been used to describe a variety of ideologies and theories, including nationalism, communism, and Sinic nationalism. \n\nIf pan-asian ideology refers to Sinic nationalism, then it can be inferred that the development mentioned in the passage is the formation of the non-aligned movement. This organization represents countries from Eurasia and Africa which do not align themselves with either the Eastern Bloc or Western Bloc.\n\nIf pan-asian ideology refers to communism, then it can be inferred that the development mentioned in the passage is the spread of communism in Asia and Africa. The Bandung Conference was convened by leaders from the non-aligned movement to discuss the challenge of communism and to promote the values of democracy and equality.\n\nIf pan-asian ideology refers to nationalism, then it can be inferred that the development mentioned in the passage is the spread of nationalism in Asia and Africa. Nationalist ideologies emphasize the importance of nations and the need for governments to promote the interests of their citizens. The Bandung Conference represented the first time that leaders from Asia and Africa came together to discuss their common interests and challenges.\n\nIt is important to note that the development mentioned in the passage was a significant moment in the history of Pan- Asia and Africa, and its influence can still be seen in current political and social discourse in these regions.",

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists.

They would have been familiar with the commodities that Ghanians traded with other parts of the world, including Asia.\n\nOne piece of evidence that supports this is the description of the king's manner of dress. He was described as adorning himself like a woman and wearing jewelry, which would have been a common way for medieval Muslim rulers to show their wealth and status.\n\nAdditionally, the passage mentions that the king collected gold dust from the mines, which would have come from Asia. This would have been a significant activity for a kingdom that was directly engaged in trade with Asia.\n\nBased on the information in the passage, we can conclude that there is evidence to support the claim that the Ghanians were engaged in trade with Asia, directly or indirectly.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

            "model_answer": "For the purpose of this question, let's consider the events depicted in McGrath's account to have taken place.\n\nBased on McGrath's account, Bonesteel understood that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or had already done so. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. He therefore decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\nThe outcome of Bonesteel's decision regarding the 38th parallel would have a significant impact on the freedom and well-being of Korean people. Specifically, by establishing this line as a dividing line, Bonesteel effectively protected the southernmost section of Korea from Russian and American troops. This would have allowed many Korean people to escape the intense fighting that was taking place in central and northern Korea, and allowed them to seek refuge in safer areas in the south.\n\nIn addition, the establishment of the 38th parallel as a dividing line would have also prevented the complete occupation of Korea by Russian and American troops. Specifically, if the line had been accepted by the Russians, it would have divided the Korean peninsula in two, and allowed Japanese forces in the southern part of Korea to continue to fight against the Americans and Soviets. This would have provided a much-needed buffer between the two sides, allowing them to negotiate a peaceful settlement.\n\nUltimately, the outcome of Bonesteel's decision regarding the 38th parallel would have had a significant impact on the freedom and well-being of Korean people, and served as a crucial turning point in the history of the Korean peninsula.",

Sub- Saharan African relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.\n\nThe importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub- Saharan Africansin the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. cannot be overstated. While commercial relations between the two continents were complex and varied over time, they were essential for the development of African societies. European goods, such as food, guns, and slaves, were central to the sustenance of regional economies and the growth of agrarian and urban populations. European traders provided much-needed goods and resources, and their contact with African societies brought new ideas, technologies, and goods to the continent.\n\nIn many areas of Sub- Saharan Africa, the European presence was deeply influential in the political and economic development of societies. European powers such as Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands established colonies in the region and played critical roles in the wars, rebellions, and transitions to independence that characterized the period. European merchants also played crucial roles in the development of African economies, from the importation of goods to the promotion of local trade.\n\nIn conclusion, the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub- Saharan Africansin the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. cannot be overstated.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The historical background for Adolf Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles mentioned in Source 1 can be traced to Hitler's belief that Poland's territorial borders should not be violated. At the end of World War I, Germany was forced to cede territories beyond its initial borders, including the Polish Corridor. This was a particularly unsatisfactory outcome for Hitler, who believed that the Treaty of Versailles had been imposed on Germany without any guarantee of its restored territorial integrity.\n\nAdditionally, Hitler was also concerned about the growing number of ethnic and political minority groups in Germany, including the Jews and the Roma. He believed that these groups posed a threat to the state and that their presence needed to be addressed.\n\nAdditionally, Hitler was also influenced by a widespread belief in Germany that it had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I. This belief was fueled by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which gave France and Britain most of the territories they had occupied during the war and which imposed harsh economic sanctions on Germany.\n\nFinally, Hitler's attempt to collaborate with Italian leader Benito Mussolini also played a role in his stance on the Treaty of Versailles. Hitler saw Mussolini as a promising partner who could help him exert more influence over the Western European powers and alleviate some of the economic sanctions imposed on Germany.\n\nIn conclusion, the historical background for Adolf Hitler's criticism of the Treaty of Versailles can be summarised as his belief that the territorial boundaries of Poland should not be violated, his concerns about the growing number of ethnic and political minority groups in Germany, and his attempts to collaborate with Italian leader Benito Mussolini.",

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",
