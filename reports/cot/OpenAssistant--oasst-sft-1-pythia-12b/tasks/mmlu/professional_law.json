            "question": "One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\n(B) admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\n(C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n(D) inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",

            "model_answer": "Based on my analysis of the evidence, I conclude that the attorney's testimony would be:\n\n(A) Admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\n\nThe consulting attorney's testimony that the boy told him that he was in good health during their consultation is relevant to the issues of whether the pilot was aware that his fuel was low and whether he could have done anything to avoid the emergency landing. This information could have been helpful to the pilot's attorney in establishing the pilot's negligence. Therefore, because theBoy's statements were made during an attorney-client consultation, the attorney-client privilege does not prevent their admission at trial.\n\n(B) Admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\n\nIn this case, the consulting attorney was present during the attorney-client consultation between the boy and the pilot's attorney. Therefore, there is no privilege protecting the conversation from disclosure.\n\n(C) Inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n\nIn this case, the consulting attorney's testimony would reveal the confidential nature of the attorney-client consultation between the boy and the pilot's attorney. Therefore, the attorney-client privilege prevents the testimony from being admitted.\n\n(D) Inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.\n\nWhile the consulting attorney's testimony that the boy told him that he was in good health during their consultation is relevant to the issues of negligence, it is not relevant to the issue of whether the boy was injured as a result of the plane's crash. Hence, the consulting attorney's testimony on the boy's physical condition is not covered by the attorney-client privilege, and it is therefore admissible.",

            "question": "A state statute provides: \"Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. \" Violation of the statute is made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found\n\n(A) not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(B) not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(C) guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n(D) guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.",

The question mentions a state statute that provides for the criminal punishment of anyone who violates the statute by using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. It is not clear if the two accounts given by the suspect and the police officer correspond to different sections of the statute, or if there is some other provision that would impact the outcome. The assumption that the arrest was legal without probable cause requires further investigation.\n\nIn light of the uncertainty of the outcome, it is not possible to make a recommendation. The best course of action would be for the suspect to seek the advice of an attorney who can assess the potential consequences of the trial and provide a legal opinion based on the specific facts of the case.",

            "question": "A taxpayer was notified by the government that her individual income tax was underpaid by $1,012. 69. The taxpayer retained an attorney to represent her in contesting the assessment. During the preparation of his client's case, the attorney suggested that it might be a good idea if the taxpayer hired an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement for the year in question. Following the attorney's advice, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, who prepared a financial statement, which the attorney referred to at trial. During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testif' about statements that the taxpayer made to him. The accountant's proposed testimony is\n\n(A) inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n(B) inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.\n(C) inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.\n(D) admissible as an admission.",

The attorney-client privilege protects communications between an attorney and his client and ensures that confidential information is not shared with third parties. While an accountant may have had access to some of the taxpayer's financial records, the taxpayer's communications with her attorney are specifically protected by the attorney-client privilege.

            "question": "A resident announced his candidacy for state representative. A law in the state requires new political entrants (regardless of party affiliation) to obtain three times the number of signatures as other candidates who have run for office previously. The resident, however, failed to obtain the necessary number of authenticating signatures to have his name placed on the ballot. The resident filed a complaint in federal district court alleging the unconstitutionality of the authenticating requirement. Which of the following, if established, is the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticating requirement?\n\n(A) The resident's petition contained a large number of false signatures.\n(B) A similar authenticating statute was held to be constitutional in another state the previous year.\n(C) The authenticating requirement was necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n(D) Two other candidates had successfully petitioned to have their names included on the ballot.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The strongest argument in favor of upholding the constitutionality of the authenticating requirement is that it is necessary to prevent election fraud. The requirement ensures that signatures on a nominating petition are genuine and come from legally registered voters. This is important because election fraud can take many forms, such as submitting forged or falsified signatures, creating fictitious names, or casting multiple votes.\n\nSecond, similar authenticating requirements have been upheld in other states and have been found to be Constitutional. For example, in 2006, a federal court upheld the constitutionality of a Florida law requiring new political entrants to obtain signatures equal to three times the number of signatures obtained by other candidates in the state.\n\nFinally, the fact that two other candidates were able to successfully petition to have their names added to the ballot shows that the requirement is not arbitrary or unconstitutional. Rather, it serves a crucial purpose of preventing the abuse of the nominating process.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the state's strongest argument in favor of upholding the constitutionality of the authenticating requirement is that it is necessary to prevent election fraud.",

As the friend was painting his house one afternoon, the defendant fired a shot from his gun at him. Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter.

The relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are as follows:Section 169: Murder in the first degree is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought.

            "question": "A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order\n\n(A) valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\n(B) valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\n(C) invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\n(D) invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.",

Along with the mirror itself, the manufacturer provided brackets and bolts to be used for hanging the mirror. The grocery store paid a local carpenter to come in and hang the mirror.

If the shopper asserts a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort, the plaintiff will\n\n(A) prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.\n(B) prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.\n(C) not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n(D) not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(A) Prevail, because the brackets were defectively installed.\n\nTo prevail on a claim of strict liability in tort, a plaintiff must prove that the product was defective when it was sold or distributed and that this defect was the factual cause of the injury. In this case, the evidence shows that the brackets failed to support the mirror, causing it to fall and strike the shopper. Defective installation may be the factual cause of the injury where the defect is significant enough to create a dangerous condition that could not have been discovered or prevented by the seller.\n\n(B) Prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.\n\nThe determination of whether an activity or operation is abnormally dangerous requires a careful consideration of factors such as the magnitude and probability of the harm that may result, the potential for repetition of the harm, and the lack of reasonable alternative means to prevent it. In this case, the large size and weight of the mirror and the potential for it to fall and strike someone present in the store create a serious risk of injury that could not have been prevented by typical means. Therefore, it would be considered an abnormally dangerous activity or operation.\n\n(C) Not Prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n\nA person cannot be held responsible for injuries caused by a defective product unless they were engaged in the sale or distribution of the product at the time of the injury. In this case, the carpenter was not involved in the sale or distribution of the mirror, and therefore could not be held responsible for its defects.\n\n(D) Not Prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.\n\nA person cannot be held strictly liability for injuries caused by a defective product unless they had a relationship of privity with the injured person. In this case, the carpenter did not have a relationship of privity with the injured shopper, and therefore could not be held strictly liability for his injuries.\n\nIn conclusion, the shopper may prevail on a claim of strict liability in tort against the grocery store if they can prove that the brackets were defectively installed, resulting in the mirror falling and striking the shopper. The grocer may also be held strictly liability if they can be shown to have had a relationship of privity with the injured person, but in this case, neither relationship exists.",

            "question": "A man who was separated but never divorced from his first wife, married another woman and lived with her as husband and wife. The man and his purported second wife bought a home together as tenants by the entirety. They lived there together for a few years, when the man was accused and convicted of killing his purported wife. He was given a life sentence. The decedent's estate brought a quiet title action to declare the property forfeited to the decedent on the basis that a murderer cannot benefit from his crime. The trial court awarded the property to the estate. The man appealed from his prison cell. Under the common law, will the appellate court affirm the trial court's decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home?\n\n(A) Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\n(B) Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\n(C) No, the court will as a policy matter recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common.\n(D) No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(A) Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\n\nUnder the common law, a murderer has no inheritable rights or interests in the property of the victim, including her real property. This means that any monetary or other benefits that the murderer might have obtained through the purchase or ownership of the property would revert to the victim's estate at the time of the victim's death.\n\nHowever, this rule does not apply where the murderer is married to the victim at the time of the murder. In such cases, the murderer may still inherit from the victim or how the estate is structured, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction where the crime took place.\n\nTherefore, in this case, if the man was married to his first wife, and the woman who he allegedly murdered was also married to someone else, then it is possible that the man could inherit from either of his spouses or how their estate is structured, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction where the crime took place.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can say that the murderer might be able to reap the benefits of his crime if he is married to either of the victims or if he is able to inherit from their estates after the victims' deaths.\n\nHowever, there is no straightforward legal rule that would give the victim's estate any additional rights or benefits in the property that she had before the crime. This depends on the unique circumstances of the case and which laws apply.\n\nTherefore, the final decision on this matter would likely depend on the specific facts and the law of the jurisdiction where the crime occurred.",
