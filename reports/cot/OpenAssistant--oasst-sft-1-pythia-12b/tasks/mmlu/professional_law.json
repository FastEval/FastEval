            "question": "One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\n(B) admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\n(C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n(D) inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Option D is the correct answer. A client cannot invoke the attorney-client privilege to prevent his attorney from disclosing what he told his attorney during a consultation, where the presence of others does not compromise the confidentiality of the communication. And statements of physical condition are non-confidential, and thus are not protected by the attorney-client privilege.",

            "question": "A state statute provides: \"Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. \" Violation of the statute is made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found\n\n(A) not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(B) not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(C) guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n(D) guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.",

            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, the final answer to this question is:\n\n(D) guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n\nThe key evidence in this case is the testimony of the police officer, who has detailed his version of the events. The suspect, on the other hand, has denied hitting the officer and has offered a different account of what happened. Given the inconsistencies in the testimony and the possibility that the suspect's version may be true, the court should find the suspect guilty of assault regardless of which account the jury believes. This conclusion is consistent with the state law, which requires a person to resist an arrest if they know or should know that they are being arrested.",

            "question": "A taxpayer was notified by the government that her individual income tax was underpaid by $1,012. 69. The taxpayer retained an attorney to represent her in contesting the assessment. During the preparation of his client's case, the attorney suggested that it might be a good idea if the taxpayer hired an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement for the year in question. Following the attorney's advice, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, who prepared a financial statement, which the attorney referred to at trial. During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testif' about statements that the taxpayer made to him. The accountant's proposed testimony is\n\n(A) inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n(B) inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.\n(C) inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.\n(D) admissible as an admission.",

            "question": "A defendant was angry at his friend for marrying the defendant's former girlfriend. As the friend was painting his house one afternoon, the defendant fired a shot from his gun at him. Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter. The defendant is subsequently charged with the first-degree murder of the daughter. The relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are as follows:Section 169: Murder in the first degree is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170: Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. Which of the following, if established, would provide the defendant with his best defense?\n\n(A) He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.\n(B) He intended only to wound the friend.\n(C) He was unaware of the elements of malice.\n(D) The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.",

            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, (C) would provide the defendant with his best defense. While it is true that the friend was killed by the bullet, the defendant was not aware of the specific intention of the shooter, and therefore could not have formed the necessary intent to take the life of another. Additionally, the negligence involved in missing the friend could be deemed to negate any malicious intent on the part of the shooter. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that a charge of first-degree murder based on negligence would be a more appropriate outcome in this case.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "If the defendant's statement was made involuntarily, it would be ruled as inadmissible. An involuntary statement is one that is made without the proper mental state or regardless of the defendant's will. In this case, if the defendant'sstatement was made under police duress, for example, by using a threat or promise of leniency, it would be considered involuntary and ruled as inadmissible.\n\nOn the other hand, a statement that is made voluntarily is one that is made freely and without external coercion. This could include statements made under questioning, where the defendant is informed of their rights and is not under any duress. In this case, the statement would likely be considered voluntary and ruled as admissible.\n\nIn cases where the defendant was not in custody when the statement was made, it would also be ruled as inadmissible. This is because a statement made while the defendant is in custody implicates Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, and statements obtained in violation of these rights are automatically ruled as involuntary and considered inadmissable.\n\nLastly, a statement that is made in response to a known police interrogation would also be ruled as inadmissable. This is because an interrogation is a form of interrogation that involves the use of questions and answers to gain information or a confession. In this case, the statement would likely be ruled as involuntary and deemed inadmissable.",

            "question": "A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order\n\n(A) valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\n(B) valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\n(C) invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\n(D) invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: **A**.\n\nThe President, as head of the executive branch, has the authority to require all federal employees to participate in international relief efforts as an expression of national security and foreign policy. While participating in such operations in a foreign country would involve a considerable amount of personal risk and could put the lives of Americans and foreign citizens at risk, the President has the inherent power to take such actions in order to protect the nation and its interests. Additionally, the existence of a well-established legal framework for collaboration between governments around the world provides a necessary framework for addressing global emergencies such as these.\n\nThe claim that participating in international relief efforts is beyond the scope of a federal employee's job responsibilities is not compelling. Federal employees work closely with various government agencies and departments on a daily basis, and it is reasonable to expect them to be willing and able to assist in times of need, whether that need is global in scope or limited to their home country.\n\nIn conclusion, the President's executive order requiring federal employees to join international relief efforts is a valid exercise of the President's authority and is a necessary response to the devastating earthquake in a foreign country.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "None of the mentioned exceptions apply to a warrantless search. A search is considered warrantless if it was conducted without a valid search warrant, and without proper legal justification. \n\nFor example, in the case of \"stop and frisk\", the police can only stop and pat down someone if they have a reasonable suspicion that the person is engaged in criminal activity. The police cannot simply stop and search anyone they choose, without some sort of underlying justification. \n\nSimilarly, in the case of \"plain view\", the police cannot engage in a search unless they have a legal reason to do so. For example, if the police are lawfully in a location and observe something that they believe to be illegal, they may be able to conduct a plain view search. \n\nIn the case of \"cold pursuit\", the term \"cold pursuit\" refers to a pursuit where the police are in hot pursuit of a suspect, but the suspect has not committed a crime or posed a threat to public safety. In this case, the police may be able to conduct a warrantless search of the suspect's belongings, as long as they have probable cause to believe that the items contain evidence of a crime or are connected to the suspect.\n\nIn summary, none of the warrantless search exceptions mentioned apply to a warrantless search of a person or their belongings.",

Along with the mirror itself, the manufacturer provided brackets and bolts to be used for hanging the mirror. The grocery store paid a local carpenter to come in and hang the mirror. A few days after the carpenter installed the mirror, the mirror suddenly fell from the wall because of a defect in the brackets. It struck a shopper on the head, causing serious injuries to him. If the shopper asserts a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort, the plaintiff will\n\n(A) prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.\n(B) prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.\n(C) not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n(D) not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Since the mirror was purchased wholesale by the grocery store, and then installed by a third party, it would likely be inappropriate to hold the grocery store strictly accountable under the doctrine of strict liability in tort. Additionally, the carpenter's installation of the mirror was not a sale of the mirror, so he would not be strictly accountable as a seller under this doctrine. Given these factors, the most likely outcome in this case is that the shopper will not be able to assert a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort.",

The man and his purported second wife bought a home together as tenants by the entirety. They lived there together for a few years, when the man was accused and convicted of killing his purported wife. He was given a life sentence. The decedent's estate brought a quiet title action to declare the property forfeited to the decedent on the basis that a murderer cannot benefit from his crime. The trial court awarded the property to the estate. The man appealed from his prison cell. Under the common law, will the appellate court affirm the trial court's decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home?\n\n(A) Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\n(B) Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\n(C) No, the court will as a policy matter recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common.\n(D) No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is D. There is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide. The probate estate merely succeeds to the rights and interests that the victim had at the time of death, including any rights in the property that she had prior to being murdered. The murderer, having committed a crime that resulted in the death of his wife, is not legally entitled to keep the property that they shared as a married couple.
