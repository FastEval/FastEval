            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nWe can start by manipulating the equation to make it easier to solve. We divide both sides by 24 to get:\n\np = \\frac{2p}{24}\n\nThis means that p can be any whole number greater than or equal to 0. We can take the square root of each side to get:\n\np = \\frac{\\sqrt{2p}}{2}\n\nNext, we consider the case where p is equal to 0. We get:\n\np = \\frac{\\sqrt{2p}}{2} = 0\n\nThis means that p can only be equal to 0 or a whole number greater than or equal to 0. We can check each case to see which one makes sense:\n\np = 0: Then we get:\n\n24 = 2p\n\np = 4: Then we get:\n\n24 = 2p\n\np = 8: Then we get:\n\n24 = 2p\n\np = 12: Then we get:\n\n24 = 2p\n\np = 24: Then we get:\n\n24 = 2p\n\nTherefore, the answer is **D**.",

We can simplify the equation by adding 10 to both sides.\n\n1 + 10 over 11 = 2 over 11\n\nSince 2 is not divisible by 11 we can ignore the 2 and continue solving the equation.\n\n1 over 11 = 1\n\nSince 1 is an integer we can think of it as 1. To simplify the notation we can remove the 1 from the equation.\n\n11 over 11 = 1\n\nSince 11 is a prime number we know that any number divided evenly by it is also a prime number. Putting this into words any number evenly divisible by 11 is also a number evenly divisible by 1. This means that 1 is also evenly divisible by 11.\n\nSince 11 is a prime number and 1 is evenly divisible by 11 we can conclude that either both numbers are 1 or both numbers are 11.\n\nWe can check for a contradiction by adding 1 to both sides.\n\n11 + 1 over 11 = 12 over 11\n\nthis would imply that 12 is also evenly divisible by 11 which is a contradiction since 12 is not divisible by 11. Therefore 1 and 1 must be 1.\n\nTo summarize, we can think of 1 as 1 and 1 as 1. because 1 is evenly divisible by either 1 or 11 we can conclude that both 1 and 1 are equal to 1 and the question can be answered.",
