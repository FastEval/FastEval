            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer the question step-by-step, we need to first understand the functional consequences of the credit purchase.\n\nThe functional consequence of a credit purchase is that it changes the vendor balance sheet quantity in an asset account, while affecting neither the vendor balance sheet quantity nor other vendor balance sheet accounts in a debit balance. The effect of a credit purchase is realized at the time of the purchase transaction and is not reflected in the balance sheet until the item is sold or otherwise settled.\n\nBased on the functional consequences of the credit purchase, we can determine the likely effect on Arno's balance sheet:\n\nIf Arno did not record the credit purchase, it would not affect the company's assets, liability, or stockholders' equity.\n\nIf Arno recorded the credit purchase but understated its inventory, it would cause an understatement of its assets and a corresponding overstatement of its liability.\n\nIf Arno recorded the credit purchase and accurately stated its inventory, it would have no effect on its assets, liability, or stockholders' equity.\n\nBased on the functional consequences of the credit purchase, we can determine that the effect of the omission would depend on Arno's accounting policies and the specific circumstances of the credit purchase transaction.",

However, when the auditor applies sampling techniques to specific risks, there is always some uncertainty associated with the accuracy of the sample.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Let's start with (A). An auditor would likely inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end to ensure that the items were received in a timely manner and are physically present at the location where they were ordered. This is to ensure that the company received the goods it was expecting and to prevent inventory losses.\n\nNow let's consider (B). An auditor would likely test internal control activities that were previously reported as inadequate to ensure that they are properly implemented and functioning as intended. This might involve inspecting the controls to make sure they are properly trained and working as expected, reviewing the reports produced by the controls to identify any areas of weakness or errors, and performing follow-up procedures to ensure that the controls continue to be effective.\n\nLet's move on to (C). An auditor would likely review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end to ensure that the client's bank accounts were properly funded and that any money that was expected to be deposited has actually been deposited. This is to ensure that the client has sufficient funds to pay its obligations and to prevent financial fraud.\n\nFinally, let's consider (D). An auditor would likely compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited to ensure that the financial statements are in agreement with the company's recorded financial position. This is to identify any errors or discrepancies that may indicate fraud or other illegal activities.\n\nOverall, based on the information provided, it seems that the auditor would likely perform procedure (B), which involves testing internal control activities that were previously reported as inadequate.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Here's my thinking:\n\n1. To calculate the NPV, we need to first calculate the present value of the profits in year five and year ten.\n\ni. Present Value of Profit in Year 5 (PV5) = $500 / (1 + 10%) = $500 / 1.1 = $466.67\n\nii. Present Value of Profit in Year 10 (PV10) = $500 / (1 + 10%) = $500 / 1.2 = $472.50\n\n2. Calculate the difference between the PV10 and the PV5 (referred to as the Net Present Value or NPV).\n\ni. NPV = PV10 - PV5\n= $472.50 - $466.67 = $8.53\n\n3. To determine the answer, we need to look at the rule for determining the net present value of a project with a discount rate: NPV = investment amount / (discount rate + interest rate), where \"interest rate\" is the rate at which repayment of principal is made.\n\nIn this case, the investment amount is $500, and the discount rate is 10%, which means the interest rate is 0% (because there is no principal repayment).\n\nTherefore, the NPV is $500 / (10 + 0%), which is equal to $500 / 1, which is equal to $500. Therefore, the answer is A.",

            "question": "On July 1 year 7 Dean Co. issued at a premium bonds with a due date of July 1 year 12.

Bond carrying Retained amount earnings\n\n(A) Overstated Understated\n(B) Understated Overstated\n(C) Overstated No effect\n(D) No effect No effect",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question step-by-step, we need to calculate the amount of interest that was earned on the premium bonds during the year. We can use the bond's terms and conditions to calculate this.\n\nThe terms of the bond state that the premium is amortized using the effective interest method, which means that the interest is calculated based on the actual amount of interest paid by the company on its other bonds during the year.\n\nTo calculate the effective interest, we need to calculate the interest rate on the other bonds. The company has issued a total of $100 million in bonds during the year, with a maturity date of July 1, 2012. The interest rates on these bonds are as follows:\n\n4% Bond No 2, maturity date July 1, 2007\n4% Bond No 3, maturity date July 1, 2008\n4% Bond No 4, maturity date July 1, 2009\n4% Bond No 5, maturity date July 1, 2010\n3% Bond No 6, maturity date July 1, 2011\n\nUsing the given interest rates, we can calculate the effective interest rate on the premium bonds. The effective interest rate for Bond No 3 is 4% + (4% * 2) = 8%. The effective interest rate for Bond No 4 is 4% + (4% * 3) = 12%. The effective interest rate for Bond No 5 is 4% + (4% * 4) = 16%. The effective interest rate for Bond No 6 is 4% + (4% * 5) = 20%.\n\nNow we can calculate the amount of interest that was earned on the premium bonds during the year. The interest earned on Bond No 1, which has a premium of $10 million, can be calculated as follows:\n\n10 million * 0.04  = 40000000 / 12 = 400000\n\nThe interest earned on Bond No 2 can be calculated as follows:\n\n40000000 / 11 = 40000000 / 10 + 40000000 / 9  = 4 mangoes / 9 = 4000\n\nThe interest earned on Bond No 3 can be calculated as follows:\n\n4 mangoes / 8 = 4000\n\nThe interest earned on Bond No 4 can be calculated as follows:\n\n4 mangoes / 13 = 4000\n\nThe interest earned on Bond No 5 can be calculated as follows:\n\n4 mangoes / 16 = 4000\n\nThe interest earned on Bond No 6 can be calculated as follows:\n\n4 mangoes / 19 = 4000\n\nTherefore, the total amount of interest that was earned on the premium bonds during the year was $16000.\n\nBased on the error at June 30 year 12, the amount of interest that was overstated was $16000, and the amount of interest that was understated was $0.\n\nTherefore, the correct amount of interest that was earned on the premium bonds during the year was $16000.",

During a tax year, the corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income and distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders. Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson\u2019s individual tax return. If the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate, how much income would Carson have reported on Carson\u2019s individual return?\n\n(A) $28,000\n(B) $132,000\n(C) $160,000\n(D) $188,000",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Check if the corporation is an S corporation. An S corporation must have only one class of members, and the members are treated as a single entity for tax purposes.\n\nIf the corporation was not an S corporation, the next step would be to calculate the proportionate allocation of the dividend to shareholders. This can be done by dividing the amount distributed to shareholders (i.e., $70,000) by the total number of shareholders (i.e., 40%). This would give us the proportionate allocation for each shareholder.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the gross income for each shareholder.\n\nSince the distributions were made proportionate to the number of shares owned, each shareholder would have received a proportional share of the dividends. Therefore, we can calculate each shareholder's gross income by multiplying the proportionate allocation by the taxable income reported by the corporation.\n\nFor Carson, the proportionate allocation would have been 28%, so his gross income would have been $28,000 x (28%) = $12,400.\n\nStep 3: Deduct contributions to covered employees' medical savings accounts. If the corporation is a partnership, steps 1-3 still apply, but the partners would have to deduct contributions to their own medical savings accounts.\n\nStep 4: Deduct business expenses.\n\nFinally, we would need to deduct any business expenses from the gross income calculated in step 3. These expenses would typically include:\n\nBusiness taxes\nInsurance costs\nUtilities expenses\nDepreciation and amortization on equipment and improvements\nStep 5: Divide the remaining amount by the number of shareholders to calculate the individual tax liability.\n\nUsing the numbers we have calculated so far, we can calculate the individual tax liability for each shareholder like this:\n\n    For Carson: $12,400 \u00f7 40% = $3,120.\n\nTherefore, Carson would have reported an individual tax liability of $3,120 for the tax year in question.",
