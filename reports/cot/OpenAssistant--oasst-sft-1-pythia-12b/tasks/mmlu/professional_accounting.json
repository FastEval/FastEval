            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The estimated yearly yield on your investment can be calculated as follows:\n\nYearly Yield = ${ rentals / purchase price } \\times 100$\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n rentals = $245 * 2 = $490,000\n\npurchase price = $98,000\n\nyearly yield = ($491,000 / $98,000) * 100% = 164%\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the estimated yearly yield on your investment is 164%.\n\nOption A is incorrect because this calculates the yield based on the estimate that the limousine will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, which may not be the case. Option B is also incorrect because the yield is calculated based on the assumption that the daily costs are $50, which also may not be the case. Option C is also incorrect because the yield is calculated based on the assumption that the limousine will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, which also may not be the case. Option D is the correct answer because it calculates the yield based on the assumption that the limousine will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, which is the correct assumption for this problem.",

            "model_answer": "It is likely that an auditor would perform an (A) inspection. An auditor would want to ensure that any ordered inventory items were received before the year-end and were reflected in the inventory. A discrepancy between the inventory and the order could indicate that the inventory was not properly managed and an audit would be necessary to confirm this.\n\nRegarding (B), an auditor would typically perform a follow-up investigation after discovering that internal control activities had previously been reported as inadequate. This could include reviewing the relevant systems and policies, and ensuring that they are being properly implemented. If the auditor discovers any areas where the internal controls are not functioning properly, they would need to be addressed to prevent future issues.\n\nRegarding (C), an auditor would typically review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months following the year-end. This would allow them to identify any suspicious transactions that may indicate fraud or illegal activity. It is important to keep in mind that banks have different policies regarding how long they keep records, so it may be necessary to check multiple banks to find the most recent information.\n\nRegarding (D), an auditor would typically compare the latest available financial statements with the statements being audited. This would allow them to identify any differences between the statements and ensure that they are in agreement with the truth. If the statements do not match, an audit would be necessary to determine the cause and ensure that corrective action is taken.",

            "model_answer": "To calculate the price of a three-year bond, we first need to determine the face value of the bond, which is $100. We then need to determine the yield, which is 6%. The formula for the yield is y = (P*interest rate)/principal, where y is the yield, P is the price, and interest rate is the annual interest rate.\n\nTo calculate the price of the bond, we first need to determine the present value of the bond. The present value of a three-year bond with a face value of $100 at a 6% yield is calculated as follows:\n\n PV = (1+r)^(3 year) * 100 * (yield / 100)\n= (1.06)^3 * 100 * 6%\n= $10,600\n\nTherefore, the price of the bond is $10,600.\n\nThe final line of the solution should contain the letter \"A\" as the answer, with parenthesis around the letter. This is because the calculated price of the bond is $10,600, which is less than the claimed price of $100, and therefore the answer is \"A\".",

This is a correct classification. However, classified as a current asset does not necessarily mean the building is actively being sold.\n\n(C) It will no longer be Depreciated.
