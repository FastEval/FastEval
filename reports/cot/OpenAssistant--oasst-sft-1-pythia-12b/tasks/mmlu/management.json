            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The term for the \"rule of thumb\" type of bias in decision making is \"over-confidence bias.\"\n\nOver-confidence bias is a cognitive bias that occurs when people are overly confident in their abilities and decisions, leading them to believe that they are more capable than they actually are and to take more risks than they should. This bias is often influenced by our experiences in life and by ourconfidence in our abilities to make accurate predictions.\n\nFor example, if you have a high degree of confidence that you will pass a difficult exam, you may be prone to over-confidence bias and take unnecessary risks such as studying too much or cramming the night before the exam.\n\nAnother example of over-confidence bias is the \" athletes salesman effect ,\" which refers to the tendency for people to overestimate their abilities and the potential financial rewards of their achievements.\n\nTo overcome over-confidence bias, it's important to have a realistic understanding of your abilities and to engage in self-reflection and risk-taking exercises to build resilience in the face of challenges. Additionally, it's important to seek out feedback from others and to regularly challenge your assumptions and beliefs.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is \"C\". \n\nThe word \"normative\" means \"related to what is right or wrong\". In this context, a \"normative perspective\" is a way of looking at something that suggests what is right or wrong about it.\n\nThe word \"view\" means \"an opinion or opinion holder\". In this context, a \"normative perspective\" is a way of seeing or understanding something.\n\nA \"normative perspective\" is therefore a particular opinion or understanding about something. In this case, the thing being discussed is the way things are, or are going to be, or should be. This particular opinion or understanding is described using the phrase \"a normative perspective\".\n\nTherefore, the final sentence in the question, \"The way things should be,\" suggests that the person who is speaking has a particular \"normative perspective\" on the way things are. This \"normative perspective\" is described using the phrase \"a normative perspective\". Therefore, the correct answer is \"C\".",

            "question": "In the 'five forces model', what is the type of competitive activity that exists between organisations?\n\n(A) The potential for entry into the industry\n(B) The threat of substitute products\n(C) The power of customers\n(D) The level of rivalry",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Competitive activity between organizations can take many forms, and the type of competitive activity that exists between organizations depends on various factors such as the nature of the industry, the size and resources of the organizations involved, and the factors that shape the market environment.\n\nIn the five forces model, competitive activity can be classified as either entry or exit.\n\nEntry into an industry involves the potential for new organizations to enter the market and compete with existing players. This can occur through new product innovations, brand recognition, or through expansion into new markets. In this type of activity, organizations may seek to differentiate their offerings from competitors, build a strong customer base, and develop a competitive advantage.\n\nExit from an industry involves the potential for existing organizations to exit the market and leave competition to new entrants. This can occur due to a variety of factors such as increased competition, falling prices, or shifts in technology or consumer preferences. In this type of activity, organizations may seek to diversify their business models, minimize costs, or adapt to new market conditions.\n\nThe potential for entry into the industry is typically driven by the growth of the industry itself, as well as by changing consumer behavior and preferences. For example, as smartphone adoption rates continue to rise, new entrants may seek to capitalize on this trend by offering innovative mobile phone solutions. In contrast, the threat of substitute products is driven by the existence of alternative products that offer similar or better levels of performance or value, and can be caused by a variety of factors such as consumer trends, technological advancements, or changes in regulatory environment.\n\nThe power of customers is driven by the ability of customers to influence the purchase decisions of organizations, and can be affected by a variety of factors such as customer loyalty, brand awareness, and product quality. In this type of activity, organizations may seek to understand and cater to the needs of their customers, and may drop products or services that are not meeting their expectations.\n\nThe level of rivalry is driven by the intensity and competition between organizations, and can be affected by a variety of factors such as market share, pricing strategies, and differentiation strategies. In this type of activity, organizations may seek to outperform their competitors, obtain a larger share of the market, or establish themselves as the market leader.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\nThere are several types of leaders who can be described as transformational. A transformational leader is one who has the ability to change the course of a organization or society for the better. Some examples of transformational leaders are Abraham Lincoln, Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr., and Barack Obama.\n\nSince the question does not provide specific criteria to identify a \"transformational\" leader, it is difficult to narrow down the options to just one. Based on the descriptions provided, it is possible to infer that \"transformational\" leaders are those who have made significant contributions to society and shifted the course of history for the better.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that option D, Bill Clinton, is the best choice as he was a successful president who made significant contributions to American society and helped to define a new era of openness and inclusivity.",

The length of each bar represents the amount of time it takes to complete each task, and the height of the bar represents the amount of resources required to complete the task. \n\nThe Gantt chart is used to visually identify potential areas for schedule conflicts, resource shortages, and other issues that can affect the progress of the project.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The writer most associated with bureaucracy is probably Max Weber.\n\n\nWeber saw bureaucracy as a necessary evil in the modern world, where the pace of life and the complexity of society made it impossible for individuals to handle things on their own. He argued that a hierarchical system was necessary to coordinate activities and ensure that things got done efficiently.\n\n\nAnother important theoretical figure in the study of bureaucracy is Adam Smith. Smith saw bureaucracy as a way for governments to mobilize resources and manufacture goods for the country. He argued that a well-run government was essential for the successful development of a society.\n\n\nHenry Fayol, on the other hand, saw bureaucracy as a tool for improving efficiency and management. Fayol believed that the most effective way to manage a large organization was to break it down into smaller, more manageable units.\n\n\nMary Parker Follett was a proponent of organization theory, which argued that successful organizations were those that were efficiently organized and managed. She believed that the key to running a successful organization was to create a sense of belonging and encourage teamwork among employees.",

He saw the development of capitalism and scientific agriculture as key factors in the emergence of modern capitalist societies, but he also believed that these societies were characterized by a lack of communitarian spirit and a focus on individualism andmaterialism.\n\nWeber's work on social character and the development of modern capitalism has had a significant influence on modern social theory and anthropology. Today, social character is often seen as an important factor in understanding the dynamics of human societies and the development of strong social institutions.",
