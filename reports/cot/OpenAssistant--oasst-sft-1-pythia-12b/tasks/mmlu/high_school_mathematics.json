For n = 2, 2^2 is a factor of 2, so 2 is powerful. For n = 3, 3^2 is also a factor of 3, so 3 is powerful. For n = 5, 5^2 is a factor of 5, so 5 is powerful. And so on.\n\nWe can see that the first prime factor p of n is necessarily odd, because if p were even, p^2 would also be even, and it would not be a factor of n. We can also see that n is not powerful if any prime factor p of n is 2, because 2^2 is not a factor of n. This means that all even numbers are not powerful, while all odd numbers are powerful. Finally, we can verify that 300 is powerful, because 300 = 2*2*3*5, and each of these factors is a power of 2, so 300 is powerful.",
