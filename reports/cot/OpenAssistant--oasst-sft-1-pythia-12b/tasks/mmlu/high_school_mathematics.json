            "model_answer": "To answer this question step-by-step, we need to determine which of the vertices of P\u2019 is the reflection of one of the vertices of P.\n\nTo start, we need to find a reflection axis. This can be done by finding a line that is parallel to the y-axis and intersects the interior of P. Such a line would be defined by the equation y = x.\n\nNext, we need to find the point on this line that is closest to each of the vertices of P. We can do this by finding the intersection point of the line with each of the vertices, and then evaluating the distance between that point and each vertex.\n\nIf we let p1 be the intersection of the line with the vertex (\u20132, \u20134), then the distance between p1 and (\u20132, \u20134) is 5. Similarly, if we let p2 be the intersection of the line with the vertex (\u20134, 1), then the distance between p2 and (\u20134, 1) is 6. Finally, if we let p3 be the intersection of the line with the vertex (2, 4), then the distance between p3 and (2, 4) is 7.\n\nNow that we have found the closest points on the line to each of the vertices of P, we can use them to determine which vertex of P\u2019 is the reflection of one of the vertices of P.\n\nLet's consider the vertex (\u20132, \u20134). The point p1 on the line y = x that is closest to (\u20132, \u20134) is located at (\u20132, \u20133). Since p1 is on the line y = x and is closest to (\u20132, \u20134), it must be the reflection of (\u20132, \u20134) across the line y = x.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider the vertex (\u20134, 1). The point p2 on the line y = x that is closest to (\u20134, 1) is located at (\u20131, 4). Since p2 is on the line y = x and is closest to (\u20134, 1), it must be the reflection of (\u20134, 1) across the line y = x.\n\nFinally, let's consider the vertex (2, 4). The point p3 on the line y = x that is closest to (2, 4) is located at (3, 0). Since p3 is on the line y = x and is closest to (2, 4), it must be the reflection of (2, 4) across the line y = x.\n\nTherefore, the vertex of P\u2019 that is the reflection of one of the vertices of P is (\u20132, \u20133).",
