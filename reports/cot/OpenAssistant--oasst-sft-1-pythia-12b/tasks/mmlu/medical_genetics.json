            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(B) involves the control of translation\n\nZinc fingers and hairpin loops are structural motifs found in a variety of proteins that play important roles in protein-protein recognition, transcription, translation, and cell signaling. Zinc finger proteins bind to specific sequences of nucleotides in DNA, called consensus sites, and play a role in regulating gene expression. Hairpin loops are similar to zinc fingers in that they are composed of two finger-like motifs that form a pocket for binding to the DNA, but hairpin loops do not bind to DNA directly.\n\nHelix-turn-helix proteins are a family of DNA-binding proteins that play a role in gene expression and regulation. These proteins contain a large three-dimensional structural domain that forms a DNA-binding pocket, and a smaller domain with two alpha-helical structures that form a recognition loop. The recognition loop specifically recognizes DNA sequences that control the expression of genes.\n\nAll of the mentioned proteins are involved in important biological processes, and their structures and functions have been extensively studied. The answer B is therefore the correct choice.",

In other words, DNA mapping became more efficient as the technology improved, allowing smaller families to be studied.\nC) has determined that the number of linkage groups is about twice the number of chromosomes - this is because the number of chromosomes in humans is 2 x 2 = 4, while the number of marker locations is usually much larger, often 20,000 or more. So, the number of groups is approximately 8 (4 + 4).\nD) has demonstrated that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes - this is because the DNA in a cell is organized into a linear array, with genes located at particular positions. By studying the locations of DNA markers, we can find out where genes are located relative to each other, and thus determine which parts of the DNA are coding for which protein.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is \"D\".\n\nIntergenerational transmission to offspring can occur as a result of parental exposures to various environmental factors, such as war, natural disasters, hunger, and inadequate nutrition. This process allows the parents to pass on their geneticinformation to their offspring, potentially leading to changes in cellular function and metabolism that canresult in long-term health effects. Additionally, exposure to environmental factors during pregnancy or during early childhood canlead to changes in the functioning of the HPA axis, which can ultimately affect stress responsivity and behaviour in the offspring.",

Therefore, the risk of transmitting the disorder is 1% for each pregnancy.\n\n(B) 10%: This is an overestimation of the risk. While phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder, not all people with the disorder will develop symptoms. Additionally, because the condition is X-linked, it will affect only male children, not female children. Therefore, the risk of transmitting the disorder to a female child is much lower than 10%.\n\n(C) 25%: This is a more appropriate estimate of the risk. While the risk of transmitting phenylketonuria is lower for female children, it is still significant and should be considered by couples who are trying to have children.\n\n(D)Almost 100%: This is an incorrect estimate of the risk. While the risk of transmitting phenylketonuria is higher for females who are carriers of the disorder, the disorder is not harmless and can cause severe neurological and physical problems if left untreated.
