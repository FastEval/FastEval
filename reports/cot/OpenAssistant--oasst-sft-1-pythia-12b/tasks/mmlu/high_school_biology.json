            "question": "In a population of giraffes, an environmental change occurs that favors individuals that are tallest. As a result, more of the taller individuals are able to obtain nutrients and survive to pass along their genetic information. This is an example of\n\n(A) directional selection.\n(B) stabilizing selection.\n(C) sexual selection.\n(D) disruptive selection.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Directional selection.\n\nIn this case, environmental changes cause individuals with certain traits, which are beneficial, to flourish and reproduce more. This type of selection is often used to explain the evolution of traits such as height or facial structure.\n\nWhat does this have to do with giraffes? Well, tall giraffes have an advantage when it comes to obtaining nutrients and avoiding predators. This means that more of them will be able to survive and reproduce, which eventually leads to a greater number of taller giraffes in the population.\n\n(B) Stabilizing selection.\n\nThis type of selection is often used to explain the evolution of traits that are beneficial in both good and bad environments. For example, a trait that helps an animal to survive droughts may also make them more susceptible to predators in wetter environments.\n\nIn the case of giraffes, the favorable environmental conditions that allow taller individuals to prosper may also make them more susceptible to disease and injury, which could reduce their overall survival and reproduction. Therefore, the survivability of tall giraffes may depend on maintaining a balance between their advantages in good environments and the risks associated with living in bad environments.\n\n(C) Sexual selection.\n\nIn this case, the ability of an animal to reproduce successfully may be influenced by factors other than genetic variation. For example, when mating preferences are influenced by factors such as body shape or physical features, this can drive the evolution of exaggerated traits that may not be directly related to survival.\n\nThis type of selection is often used to explain the evolution of traits that increase the probability of mating and reproduction, such as elaborate decorations or songizations.\n\nIn the case of giraffes, sexual selection may have played a role in the evolution of exaggerated male characteristics, such as the long, curved necks that are used to attract females during mating season. Furthermore, female giraffes may be influenced by male characteristics such as size and strength, which could also result in the evolution of exaggerated male traits.\n\n(D) Disruptive selection.\n\nThis type of selection is often used to explain the evolution of traits that are detrimental in dense or competitive environments. For example, an trait that allows an animal to avoid being intercepted by predators may also make them vulnerable to cannibalism by other members of the same species.\n\nIn the case of giraffes, the dense habitat in which they live may lead to competition for resources, particularly water. The ability of taller giraffes to obtain more water may come at the cost of weaker or fewer individuals in the herd being able to survive. Therefore, the survival of taller giraffes may depend on being able to compete successfully for resources and avoid being dominated by stronger individuals.",

            "question": "Which of the changes below following the start codon in an mRNA would most likely have the greatest deleterious effect?\n\n(A) a deletion of a single nucleotide\n(B) a deletion of a nucleotide triplet\n(C) a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the first codon position\n(D) a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the third codon position",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The deletion of a single nucleotide at the startcodon of an mRNA is likely to have the greatest effect on the encoded protein's function. This results in the loss of the startSignal that is essential for translation initiation. This mistake could cause the translation of the mRNA to start at a different location, leading to the production of an incorrect protein.\n\nA deletion of a nucleotide triplet also has the potential to disrupt the reading frame, causing a frameshift mutation and the introduction of a premature stop codon. This could lead to the production of a defective protein or nucleotide sequence that could have serious consequences for the organism.\n\nA single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the first coding position is also likely to have a significant effect on the protein's function. This could alter the amino acid sequence of the protein, affecting its structure and folding. Additionally, a substitution of the first coding position could result in the creation of a new startSignal or the disruption of an existing one.\n\nFinally, a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the third coding position is also likely to have a significant effect on the protein's function. This could alter the amino acid sequence of the protein, affecting its structure and folding. Additionally, a substitution of the third coding position could result in the creation of a new stopcodon or the disruption of an existing one.\n\nOverall, the deletion of a single nucleotide at the startcodon of an mRNA, along with a substitution of the nucleotide occupying the first coding position, are the most likely to cause the greatest harmful effect on the protein product.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: (C) The wings of an insect and the wings of a bird.\n\nThe notochord is a structure found in chordate embryonic fossil records that is believed to be the evolutionary precursor to the notochord in living chordates. However, notochord development has been independently evolved in multiple evolutionary lines, including insects, birds, and mammals. This indicates that notochord development is not a uniqueachievement of chordates, but rather a general feature present in a diverse range of developmental contexts.\n\nInsect wings and bird wings are anatomically similar in that they both contain feathers and are used for flight. However, the evolutionary origin of insect wings and bird wings is different. Insect wings originated from the\u201cwings\u201d or \u201c membranous wings\u201d of ancient flying insects. They are lightweight and aerodynamic, and are used for rapid and agile flight. In contrast, bird wings are formed by the same developmental processes as human arms and legs, and are designed for long-distance travel and aerial surveillance. The feathers found on bird wings are not used for flight, but rather for insulation, thermoregulation, and display. Thus, the presence of a notochord in insect wings and the absence of a notochord in bird wings suggest that insect wings and bird wings are derived from distinct evolutionary lines and have different functions in the lives of their respective organisms.",

            "model_answer": "The most likely benefit of periodic natural wildfires in some forest ecosystems is D - the fires dry out the soil and decrease the chance of flooding after heavy rains.\n\nThe fires can reduce the amount of moisture in the soil by increasing heat and reducing humidity. The increased heat can also cause the soil to become less moist, which can prevent plant growth. The decreased humidity can also result in increased air temperatures, which can further dry out the soil.\n\nThe fires can also reduce the densities of some species of plants by removing competitors that may be able to establish themselves in the burned area. Additionally, the wildfires can help to homogenize the soil and remove any Hitchcock masking effects that may have inhibited the growth of some species in the ecosystem.\n\nThe fires can also increase the diversity of plant species in the ecosystem by providing an environment that is more conducive to the growth of a wide range of plant species. This can help to overcome the effects of habitat loss and degradation, which can also lead to the loss of species diversity.\n\nOverall, the benefits of wildfires in forest ecosystems include the removal of dead and decaying plant material, the moderation of fire severity, the reduction of habitat competition, the stimulation of biodiversity, and the maintenance of ecosystem resilience in the face of natural disasters.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Based on the available information provided, the best-supported conclusion is that selection for noctural algae-eaters (active only at night) should be observed in an algae-eater population subject to predation pressure from pike-cichlids. This conclusion is supported by the observation that noctural algae-eaters are better able to detect and respond to predators in their absence, and by the fact that predators that operate at night are more active and successful in predating algae-eaters than those that operate during the day. Additionally, larger female algae-eaters, which are capable of producing larger broods of offspring, would be more vulnerable to predators and would therefore be selected for if predation pressure were to increase. Finally, it is likely that selection for smaller sexually mature algae-eaters would not occur in the presence of predation pressure, as such young fish are more susceptible to capture by predators and do not tend to have the energetic resources required to successfully compete with algae-eating fish for food.",
