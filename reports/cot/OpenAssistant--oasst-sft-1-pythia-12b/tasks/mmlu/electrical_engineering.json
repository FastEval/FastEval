            "model_answer": "The Barkhausen criterion for an oscillator states that the loop gain of the feedback loop should be unity, meaning that the output signal equals the input signal. This can be achieved by adding a negative feedback loop to the circuit.\n\nLooping around the feedback loop, the input signal will gain some delay and may become audible as anechoic ringing. The feedback signal will try to bring the input signal back to its original value, but will be unable to do so if the loop gain is less than unity.\n\nResponse: B (Loop gain should be less than unity)\n\nA negative feedback loop will cause the gain of the loop to be less than one, meaning that the output signal will be smaller than the input signal. The phase of the feedback signal will be equal to the loop delay, which in this case is equal to the time it takes for the input signal to reach the feedback node.\n\nSince the input signal has already traveled down the feedback loop once, it will have picked up a phase shift of 180\u00b0. The output signal will also have picked up a phase shift of 180\u00b0 due to the loop delay, resulting in a total phase shift of 360\u00b0. This means that the feedback signal will be in phase with the input signal, meaning that the loop gain will be equal to one.\n\nResponse: B (Loop gain should be less than unity)\n\nHowever, if the loop gain was equal to one, the feedback loop would remain stable despite the amplification of the input signal, and the speaker would not produce any tones. This means that setting the loop gain to unity is necessary for the circuit to produce anechoic ringing and operate as an oscilliator.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The method of using a potentiometer to measure DC voltage is more accurate than using a voltmeter because it:\n\nLoads the circuit moderately: The potentiometer is connected in series with the circuit, loading it to a small degree. This reduces the error caused by the resistance of the circuit elements and results in a more accurate reading.\n\nUses a centre zero galvanometer: Instead of using a voltmeter that measures the voltage between two points on the circuit, the potentiometer uses a centre zero galvanometer that measures the voltage across the centre point of the potentiometer. This results in a more accurate reading as the readings are less likely to be affected by variations in the resistance of the circuit elements.\n\nDoes not load the circuit at all: Unlike a voltmeter, the potentiometer does not measure the voltage directly. Instead, it uses a small signal to measure the voltage. Therefore, it does not load the circuit as heavily as a voltmeter would, reducing the error caused by the circuit elements.\n\nOverall, using a potentiometer to measure DC voltage is more accurate than using a voltmeter because it allows for a more accurate measurement and reduces the risk of errors caused by variations in the resistance of the circuit elements.",
