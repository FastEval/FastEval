When the server receives the request, it attempts to connect directly to the user's computer using a protocol such as TCP/IP. If the connection is successful, the server sends the requested file to the user.

The server repeatedly attempts to connect to the user's computer until a connection is established. Once a connection is established, the server sends the requested file to the user.\n\nTherefore, Option D best describes how the file is sent to the user in this scenario.",

Here, 14 is represented as 10*2 + 4, and 3A is represented as 10*2 + 3*2 + A.\n\nThe rule for multiplying two hexadecimal numbers is the same as the rule for multiplying two decimal numbers: multiples of 16 are added, while multiples of 100 are multiplied by 10.\n\nTherefore, 10*2 + 4 is equal to 20 and 10*2 + 3*2 + A is equal to 50.

The mean is calculated by dividing the sum of all grades by the number of students who took the course.\n\nWe can find the mean of the grades for computer science majors at a specific school by calculating the sum of the grades for all computer science majors divided by the number of computer science majors at that school.\n\nHere is the SQL code to calculate the mean of the grades for all computer science majors at a specific school:\n\n```\nSELECT school, AVG(grade) AS average_grade\nFROM students\nJOIN courses ON students.id = courses.student_id\nWHERE courses.area = 'computer science'\nGROUP BY school;\n```\n\nThis code uses the `AVG` function to calculate the mean of the grades for all computer science majors at a school. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include rows where the student is majoring in computer science and the course is in the `computer science` area.\n\nThe `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by school, so that each school's average grade is calculated separately.\n\nThe resulting SQL result will contain two rows: one for each school. The first column contains the school name and the second column contains the average grade for all computer science majors at that school.\n\nThe final line of code contains the answer as a single letter (i.e., `A`) with parenthesis, without anything else.
