            "model_answer": "Let's first look at statement 1:\n\nLinear regression is an example of a linear model, which seeks to find a function f(x) that best fits a given set of data points {x1, x2, . . . , xn}. Linear regression seeks to find a function f(x) of the form f(x) = w0 + w1x1 + w2x2 + ... + wnxn. The parameter vector w contains the weights for the data points.\n\nThe least squares solution to the ordinary least squares problem is given by (x-x_mean)T(x-x_mean) = 0, where x_mean is the mean of the training data. This solution provides us with a linear estimator of the parameters w.\n\nWe can see that the least squares solution minimizes the sum of the squared errors, which is a measure of how well the estimated parameters fit the training data. This therefore suggests that the least squares solution is a good candidate for an unbiased estimate of the parameters.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the least squares solution is not the only unbiased estimate of the parameters. Other unbiased estimates include the maximum likelihood estimate and the Bayesian estimate.\n\nNext, we look at statement 2:\n\nAdaBoost is a machine learning algorithm that involves training multiple classifiers iteratively in order to improve the accuracy of the final classification result. The AdaBoost algorithm is based on a training algorithm called \"boosting.\"\n\nIn boosting, each classifier is trained on a reduced training set that is created by combining the training data with a random subset of the training data. The training data is then sorted based on the predicted class labels, and the probabilities of the training data points belonging to each class are calculated.\n\nThe AdaBoost algorithm then takes advantage of the ordered probabilities and uses them to train a new classifier. The new classifier is trained using the same process as the original classifiers, but with a slightly larger training set that includes the most likely training data points from the previous classifiers.\n\nThe AdaBoost algorithm is designed to handle cases where the class labels are not evenly distributed in the training data. By focusing on the most likely training data points, the AdaBoost algorithm is able to improve the accuracy of the final classification result compared to other algorithms.\n\nBased on statements 1 and 2, we can conclude that:\n\n(A) True",

Statement 1 says that RoBERTa is pretested on a corpus that is approximate 10x larger than the corpus BERT was pretested on. This implies that the RoBERTa model is trained on a much larger dataset that provides a more comprehensive view of language.\n\n2. Statement 2 suggests that ResNeXts in 2018 usually used tanh activation functions.

Increasing the amount of training examples will decrease the variance of the model, until it saturates at the largest possible value determined by the amount of training data.
