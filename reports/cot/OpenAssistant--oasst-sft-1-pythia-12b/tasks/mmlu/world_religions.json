            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Here is my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n    325 CE is a gracious estimate for the founding date of the Buddhist temple in Nara. However, it is not the earliest such Buddhist temple that has been archaeologically confirmed. For example, the H\u014dry\u016b-ji temple complex was founded around 713 CE. temples would not have existed during the Heian period (c. 684-1185 CE), so the first temple would have been built in the early Nara period (c. 603-645 CE).\n\n    119 CE is the date that the Asoka edicts were publicly displayed for the first time in India. The Asoka edicts were a series ofHiren NPRA records discovered buried at the Hariodandaya site in Gandhara, Pakistan in 1968. The edicts date to the reign of Ashoka, who was a celebrated king of India and Gandhara, and provide valuable information about the circulation of Buddhism in India under his rule.\n\n    451 CE is the date that the Tanab\u014d-in Shinto Shrine was first built, according to Japanese historical records. Tanab\u014d-in is located in Nara Prefecture and is considered one of the oldest buildings in Japan. The foundation stone for the Shrine was laid on the 5th day of the 1st month in 451 CE and it was completed in 457 CE. Therefore, the Shrine dates to this period and can be considered the oldest shrine in Nara Prefecture.\n\n    596 CE is the date that the H\u014dryu-ji temple was completed, according to Japanese historical records. The H\u014dryu-ji temple was built in Nara Prefecture during the Nara period and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The completion date for the temple is recorded in various historical records and is considered the most reliable date. Therefore, 596 CE is the date of completion for the H\u014dryu-ji temple and can be considered the earliest Buddhist temple in Japan.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Here is your answer:\n\nThe name of the ten day New Year festival that celebrated Babylon's culture is Akitu.\n\nThe reasoning behind this answer is as follows:\n\nThe festival is called \"Akitu\" in Babylonian, which is the ancient language of the region. The word \"Akitu\" is composed of the elements \"ake-\" meaning \"New\" and \"tu\" meaning \"Day.\" Therefore, the festival is a celebration of the start of a new 10-day cycle in which new beginnings are sought and honored.\n\nThe word \"Akitu\" is also associated with the god Enuma Elish, who is known as the god of the new year and creation in Mesopotamian mythology. According to Enuma Elish, the god Akitu created the world out of nothing and controlled the day and night cycles. He is also associated with the concept of progress and renovation, and is seen as a symbol of hope and change in the new year.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n\n\"Wag and Thoth\" is a word play that plays on the sounds the words \"ake\" and \"tu\" make together. However, the word \"Akitu\" is the official name of the festival, so this option is not supported by the information provided.\n\nBast is the name of another deity in Mesopotamian mythology, but it does not appear to have any relevance to the festival.\n\n\"Nehebkau\" is the Babylonian word for \"New Year,\" but it does not contain the elements \"ake-\" or \"tu\" and is not a proper name for a festival.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The word that Guru Nanak referred to as the \"divine word\" is usually considered to be the Guru Granth Sahib, which is a collection of writings that includes teachings, poems, and other spiritual texts compiled by Guru Nanak.\n\nGuru Nanak's teachings are focused on the idea that God is beyond words and can only be experienced through direct experience and spiritual searching. He believed that the divine word is a secret word that can only be revealed to those who have v\u00e9rtayam, which is a deep spiritual intuition that allows them to perceive the truth about God.\n\nIn one of the Gurmukhs' teachings, he states that the divine word is not a physical sound or word, but a spiritual energy that is present in all beings and can be experienced through spiritual practices such as meditation and worship.\n\nBased on this interpretation, the answer to the question is \"D\". The word \"shabad\" is used in a similar context in some of Guru Nanak's writings, but it is not explicitly defined as the divine word in the same way as the Guru Granth Sahib.\n\nIt's worth noting that different scholars and sects of Sikhism have different opinions regarding the nature of the divine word and its importance in Sikhism.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is **\"A\"**.\n\nThe mi'raj is a term in Islam that refers to the Journey of Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem and back, during which he is said to have encountered 40 divinely inspired words of knowledge and to have had supernatural encounters with angels and other creatures. The story of the mi'raj is a central aspect of Islamic belief and has been the subject of many popular works of literature, art, and music.\n\nBased on the context of the question, I believe that **\"A\"** is the most likely answer because it specifically references the famous encounter with the angel Gabriel that is described in the Islamic scripture, the Quran. The verse that is most often cited as evidence of the mi'raj is verse 17:44, which states:\n\n\"And He is the obedient servant of God, His Lord, who caused His Prophet (Muhammad) to descend from His Mountain, the Mountain of Questions, with Himself; and He isPrecious as the Pearl, But those who do not see (Him) - They are the heedless.\"\n\nThis verse suggests that Muhammad saw God while descending from the mountain, and that this vision was a defining moment in his life and a moment of spiritual enlightenment. In addition, the phrase \"the mountain of questions\" is often interpreted to refer to a spiritual realm or a test of faith, which could be an explanation for why Muhammad was given this divine vision.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of a \"miraculous ascent to heaven\" is a common trope in Islamic culture, and it is often used to describe the events of the mi'raj. The Quran mentions numerous instances of Muhammad ascending to heaven in a supernatural manner, and these stories are often seen as evidence of the divine nature of Muhammad and the importance of following him in this life and in the afterlife.\n\nOverall, I believe that **\"A\"** is the correct answer to the question \"What is the mi'raj?\" because it provides a clear and accurate description of the central events of the Islamic holy book and of the importance of the mi'raj in the lives of Muslims.",

            "model_answer": "The term \"Qur'an\" refers to the Islamic scripture, which is written in Arabic and has been central to the Islamic faith for more than a thousand years. The Quran is a collection of God's messages to humanity through the Prophet Muhammad, who is considered the highest authority on Islam.\n\nThe Quran is divided into four sections: the Introduction, the Meccan Chapter, the Medinan Chapter, and the surah (chapter). Each surah begins with the phrase \"In the Name of God, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful,\" which is a clear indication that the surah is a message from God.\n\nThe Quran instructs people to live according to God's teachings, which include the principles of kindness, compassion, and equality. It also provides guidance on how to worship God, such as the importance of prayer and fasting.\n\nOverall, the term \"Qur'an\" refers to the sacred text of Islam, which is a central aspect of the Muslim faith and serves as a source of religious and spiritual nourishment for millions of people around the world.",
