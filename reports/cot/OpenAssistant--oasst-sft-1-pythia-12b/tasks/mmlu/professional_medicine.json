            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Based on the provided information, it is likely that the patient's decreased sensation is related to the complications of the IVC filter placement. Specifically, the filter may be causing compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, which can cause numbness and tingling in the affected area. It is important for the patient to have further evaluation and treatment for this condition.",

She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated.

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Determine the patient's medical history and any relevant risk factors.\n\nThe patient is a 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female. She had a previous cesarean section and has a history of irregular contractions.\n\nStep 2: Perform a physical examination.\n\nExamination of the patient shows no signs of distress and no evidence of an emergency condition. The fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is fully effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the patient's progress in labor.\n\nThe patient's contractions have become intermittent and weak, and she has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. This suggests that the patient's labor is becoming more stalled or reflected. She should be monitored closely and receive additional intrapartum support as needed.\n\nStep 4: Determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\nBased on the patient's history, physical examination, and evaluation of her labor progress, the most likely diagnosis is lower uterine retraction ring (B). This diagnosis is based on the presence of contractions that push the cervix and the fetal head down, leading to the patient's symptoms of vaginal bleeding, reduced fetal movements, and decreased fetal heart tones.\n\nStep 5: Make appropriate medical decisions.\n\nBased on the diagnosis of lower uterine retraction ring, further treatment may include the insertion of an obstetrical forceps to protect the fetal head and the administration of medications to assist in the progression of labor and delivery. The patient should be closely monitored and transferred to a hospital capable of managing obstetrical emergencies if her condition becomes more serious.\n\nAnswer: B",

            "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of a low-grade fever, cough, and runny nose. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold.

            "model_answer": "The most appropriate interpretation of these study results is: B, the findings are statistically significant but not necessarily clinical.\n\nThe study was designed to have apower of 0.80 to detect a difference in mean time to resolution of symptoms of 0.6 days, which is a moderate effect size. However, due to chance, the observed difference between the two treatment groups was 0.4 days, which is smaller than the desired effect size. Therefore, the probability of observing this difference simply by chance is larger than 0.8, which is the required threshold for statistical significance.\n\nHowever, the observed difference is concordant with the predicted difference of 0.6 days, based on the statistical model, and is therefore unlikely to be due to chance. Hence, the observed difference is most likely due to the effect of the treatment, and is therefore a positive trial result.\n\nTherefore, while the study did not demonstrate statistical significance at the traditional 0.05 level, the observed difference is a plausible and therefore scientifically valid result under the current evidence material.",

The median nerve supplies sensation to the majority of the skin of the palm, wrist, and fingers, as well as sensation to the first digit (the little finger). Therefore, the numbness and weakness in the hand and pain and tingling in the ring and small fingers would be consistent with entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist.\n\nTo confirm this diagnosis, the physician should perform a thorough examination of the patient's hand to identify the specific site of the entrapment and diagnose any additional related conditions, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or Raynaud's disease. If further tests or treatments are necessary, the physician should refer the patient to an appropriate healthcare professional for further evaluation and management.",

Physical examination shows a 1.5-cm mass on the apex of the tongue. Further evaluation of the mass confirms squamous cell carcinomas.\n\nWe can start by determining the primary tumor. The tongue is a very common site of oral cancer, so it is likely that the patient has a primary tumor in the tongue. Squamous cell carcinomas are the most common type of tongue cancer, so we can be confident that the lump on the tongue is a cancerousmass.\n\nNext, we need to consider the patient's presentation and medical history. The patient has a 6-month history of a lump on his tongue that is interfering with his speech and eating, which could indicate cancerous growth. He also has had a significant weight loss, which could indicate a poor general health state. Finally, he has a history of smoking and consuming alcohol, which are known risk factors for tongue cancer.\n\nBased on the information we have collected, we can conclude that the most appropriate next step is to evaluate the patient's neck for evidence of metastasis. The inferior deep cervical nodes are the most common sites for metastasis in tongue cancer, so they are the first node that should be evaluated in this patient.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (D), thesubmental nodes.",

In particular, we can note that the appropriate dose of furosemide (a loop diuretic) for the treatment of decreased renal function in an adult should generally be less than 80 mg daily, and even as low as 40 mg daily in severe cases (this can increase the risk of magnesium wasting).
