            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "According to the provided information, the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh is a compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.\n\nThe lateral femural canal is a surgically created opening in the spine that serves as an exit for the lateral branch of the obturator nerve and the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. If the nerve is compressed or entrapped within the canal, it can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the affected leg.\n\nIn this case, the patient reported a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness in her left leg, which is consistent with a potential compressed nerve. Additionally, she reported improvement in the sensation over the past week, which could suggest that the nerve has begun to recover.\n\nBased on the history, examination, and other relevant factors, it is reasonable to believe that compression of the lateral femural canal is the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh.",

            "question": "A 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female is admitted to the hospital at 39\u00a0weeks' gestation in active labor. She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated. The most likely diagnosis is\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions\n(B) lower uterine retraction ring\n(C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction\n(D) primary dysfunctional labor",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Here is my explanation step-by-step:\n\n1.  Consider the fetal heart tones: A 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female is admitted to the hospital at 39\u00a0week's gestation in active labor. She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0 minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. However, fetal heart tones are normal, which suggest that the fetus is not in distress.\n\n2.  Examine the cervix: The cervix should be fully effaced and closed (7\u00a0cm dilated). If the cervix is not fully effaced and transparent, this may indicate the presence of a cervical lesion, such as a tumor, cervical ectopy, or infection, which could be a cause of dystocia.\n\n3.  Consider the membranes: The membranes should be intact, which suggests that the fetus is not in cephalopelvic orumbilical dystocia.\n\n4.  Consider the fetal position: The fetal position should be safely engaged and the fetal head is properly positioned, which suggests that the fetus is not in undue stress or danger.\n\n5.  Consider the APGAR scores: The APGAR scores, which are the seven scores that are obtained at one minute after birth, should be within the normal range, which suggests that the fetus is not in distress.\n\n6.  Explain your reasoning: Based on the presence of a normal fetal heart tones, fully effaced cervix, intact membranes, gentle fetal position, and normal APGAR scores, the most likely diagnosis is that the patient is having Braxton Hicks contractions. Braxton Hicks contractions are common during pregnancy and are often associated with proper progression of labor. The presence of hypotonic uterine dysfunction, primary dysfunctional labor, and cervical lesion are less likely diagnoses in this case.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "A) Atrial fibrillation\n\nAtrial fibrillation is a common complication of left heart disease and valve disease. The patient has left heart disease and a grade 3/6 left-sided murmur, which makes a diagnosis of left-sided valve disease very likely. Systemic hypertension is a more common finding in patients with valve disease, and it is possible that the patient has developed high blood pressure as a result of the valve disease. However, this cannot be ruled out completely without further testing. Finally, a radiofemoral delay is also a common finding in patients with left-sided valve disease and can be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the risk of complications associated with the patient's condition is significantly increased, and an evaluation forAtrial Fibroma and Pulmonary Embolism should be completed to rule out other potential etiologies.",

They are strategically located near important regional nerves, such as the facial nerve and maxillary nerve, and are frequently used for determining the spread of head and neck cancers. Tumor growth in the parotid gland typically occurs from a primary tumor in a neighboring organ, such as the oral cavity, thyroid, or parathyroid, and can spread to regional nodes through the facial, inferior deep cervical, or retropharyngeal routes.\n\nIn this patient, the mass found on the tongue is likely to be a primary tumor of the tongue, which is known to frequently spread to the parotid nodes. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the lump on the tongue could have spread to the parotid nodes, leading to the observed symptoms of speech difficulty and weight loss.\n\nRegarding the site of the metastasis, the retropharyngeal node is the most common metastasis found in parotid carcinomas, and cases of metastasis to this node have been reported in literature. Other nodes such as the inferior deep cervical and parotid nodes may also be involved, especially in more advanced stages of the disease.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and medical history, it is most appropriate to evaluate the parotid nodes for evidence of metastasis in this patient.",

            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for the 42-year-old man with a renal calculus and increased calciumuria is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.\n\nTo understand why, we first need to know a bit about the mineral metabolism. Calcium is a mineral that is essential for proper bone development and maintenance. However, too much calcium in the body can cause problems, such as hypercalcaemia.\n\nThe kidney plays an important role in maintaining a healthy level of calcium in the body. It removes excess calcium through the urine, and it also regulates the amount of dietary calcium that is absorbed. When the renal calculus is present, it can interfere with the normal removal of calcium from the body.\n\nCarbonic anhydrase (CA) enzymes are involved in the regulation of pH and the balance of carbon dioxide and water in the body. CA inhibitor drugs can block the activity of these enzymes, causing an increase in blood carbon dioxide levels and a decrease in blood pH. This can help to increase the urine pH and promote the removal of excess calcium from the body.\n\nAnother important reason to use a CA inhibitor as therapy for the renal calculus is to prevent further urinary calcium losses. Calculi can grow and become more complex over time, which can lead to increased stone symptoms and an increased risk of complications. By using a CA inhibitor to increase the urine pH and promote the removal of excess calcium, the man can help to prevent this from happening.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, a CA inhibitor such as acetazolamide or hydrochlorothiazide is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for the 42-year-old man with a renal calculus and increased calciumuria. controlling the urine pH and promoting the renal elimination of calculi",
