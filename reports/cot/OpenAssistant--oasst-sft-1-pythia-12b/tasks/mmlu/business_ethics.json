            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The typical advertising regulatory bodies suggest, for example, that adverts must not: encourage unsafe practices, cause unnecessary distress or fear, and must not cause offence.\n\nAdverts that encourage unsafe practices, such as smoking or drink- driving, may be illegal. Offensiveness and distress are subjective and can vary depending on cultural norms and personal values. Hence, to ensure consistent and effective regulation, it is essential to use clear and objective criteria to determine what constitutes acceptable advertising.\n\nIn this case, the suggested criteria are:\n\n    the adverts must not encourage dangerous or illegal practices.\n    they must not cause unnecessary distress or fear.\n    they must not cause offence to any group or individual.\n\nTo determine whether the adverts meet these criteria, one must consider the text, images, and sounds in the adverts in the context of the audience and the purpose of the ads. For example, a humorous cartoon may not cause offence to some people, while it may cause offence to others. The same goes for severe or offensive language.\n\nTo ensure consistency and effectiveness, the typical advertising regulatory bodies should work with expert panels and consult with relevant stakeholders, including the public, to establish clear and objective standards for acceptable advertising.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Based on my analysis of the information provided, the correct answer is \"D\".\n\nAs an AI language model, my responses are based on patterns found in large amounts of text data. During the training process, I was exposed to a wide variety of employment related legal and regulatory concepts, which helped me develop a basic understanding of the different obligations that workers and employers have towards each other.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, a worker has several rights under employment law, including the right to join a union, the right to form a union, the right to collective bargaining, and the right to strike. These rights are protected by law and are derived from the basic human right to engage in economic activity, which is protected by the International Labor Organization's Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nOn the other hand, an employer has certain duties toward its workers, including the obligation to provide employment and to provide reasonable terms and conditions of employment. These duties are also protected by law and are derived from the basic human right to work.\n\nBased on this analysis, the conclusion is that employer duties are more closely aligned with the concept of \"employer obligations\" and are less closely aligned with the concept of \"employee rights.\" As such, the correct answer is \"D.\"",
