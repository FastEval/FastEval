            "model_answer": "(A) Large and clumsy to manage\nThe access matrix approach to protection is based on the idea of creating a grid or table that describes all possible combinations of access rights for resources and processes. Each entry in the matrix represents a specific protection requirement for a resource, and the corresponding permissions granted to a process.\n\nThe matrix can become quite large, especially for complex protection requirements. This can make it difficult to manage and maintain. Additionally, the size of the matrix can make it difficult to quickly determine whether a process has access to a resource, as the process would need to examine each entry in the matrix.\n\n(B) Not capable of expressing complex protection requirements\nOne of the limitations of the access matrix approach to protection is that it is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements. For example, it may not be able to express the need to restrict access to certain resources based on the concept of sensitivity information or the expression of political views.\n\nIn contrast, other approaches to protection, such as role-based access control (RBAC), can handle complex protection requirements more effectively. RBAC defines roles and rules that can be used to grant or deny access to resources based on the activities of a user or group. This allows for more fine-grained control over access rights and can better express complex protection requirements.\n\n(C) Decision whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable\nAnother limitation of the access matrix approach to protection is that it is not capable of determining whether a process has access to a resource in all possible scenarios. In some cases, this can make it difficult to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive resources.\n\nIn contrast, other approaches to protection, such as access control based on attribute-based encryption (ABE), can handle this issue more effectively. ABE involves using attribute-based encryption to encrypt sensitive data, and then applying access control rules based on the attributes of the data. This can allow for more precise control over access and can make the decision whether a process has access to a resource more accurate.\n\n(D) There is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself\nFinally, the access matrix approach to protection does not offer a way to express who has the right to change the access matrix itself. In some cases, this can make it difficult to ensure that changes to the access matrix are made in a controlled and consistent way.\n\nIn contrast, other approaches to protection, such as role-based access control (RBAC), can provide a way to control who has the right to change the access matrix. RBAC defines roles and rules that can be used to grant or deny access to resources, and these roles can be assigned to individuals or groups, giving them the right to make changes to the access matrix.",

The directory structure is designed to minimize the amount of disk space used. The file system divides the disk block assigned to a file into multiple pages, and stores the pages in separate directories. The directory entries for the shared files point to the page directories for those files, so that only the directory structure and the pages themselves are stored on the disk.\n\nBased on these characteristics, we can identify a primary drawback to the approach to sharing used in the directory structure:\n\n1. If the owner of a file modifies the file, the modification will be visible to all other users who share the directory structure. This could be a potential security concern, as it could enable users to modify files without being detected.\n\n2. If the owner of a file renames the file, other users who share the directory structure may not be able to access the renamed file.
