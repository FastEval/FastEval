The value of the flag is 0 for no access and 1 for access.\nConditional access: in order to express complex protection requirements, the access matrix is augmented with rules that specify when a process has access to a resource. The rules are expressed using the binary flag and some condition. For example, a process can have access to a resource if it has the flag 1 and the condition is true.\nMechanisms: ownership and permissions are mechanisms that can be used to control access to resources. For example, ownership can be used to control who can access a resource. Permissions can be used to control what a process can do with a resource.\nExample: consider a protected dataset that is stored in a database. If the dataset is owned by a user, the owner can access the dataset. If the dataset is accessible to everyone, any user can access the dataset. However, the dataset may also be protected by a permission system that allows only a subset of users to access the dataset. In this case, the permission system can be used to control who can access the dataset.",
