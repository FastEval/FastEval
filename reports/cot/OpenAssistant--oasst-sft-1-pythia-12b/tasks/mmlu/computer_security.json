            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Answer: (D) Mutation-based\n\nExplanation:\nA generational fuzzer starts by creating a set of seeds, or starting points, for the program. These seeds are used to explore a small portion of the program at a time. The seeds are then mutated and used to explore a larger portion of the program. As the fuzzer explores more of the program, it creates more seeds and mutates them.\n\nIn this case, a mutation-based fuzzer would likely be effective at exploring paths through the program, as it can randomly modify the seeds it generates to create new paths. However, a generational fuzzer may also be effective in this case, as it can start by exploring a small portion of the program and gradually expand its search area as it discovers more paths.",

What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",

Modulo is one way to do this.\n\nWhen you want to send a message to several people, you can use a modular sum. For example, to send a message to five people who each get a different part, you would calculate five modulo 4. (ore our example, you would send the first part to person 1, the second to person 2, and so on). In this case, person 1 would get 2, person 2 would get 1, and so on.\n\nThe modulo operator allows you to calculate a value without having to know the whole value at once.

The validator only checks that the code cannot perform operations that would escalate the privileges of the program.\n\nRegarding Ben Bitdiddle's concerns about the segregation of memory, it is true that segmentation can be used to control access to memory. However, the validator does not fully enforce memory segmentation policies, as it only checks that memory accesses are within the bounds of the sandboxed module's data area and do not access memory outside of the module's code area.\n\nRegarding Ben Bitdiddle's concerns about the isolation of code, NaCl uses Intel x86 segmentation to ensure that the sandboxed module does not read or write memory outside of its own data area. However, even with these measures in place, it is possible for an attacker to gain control of the sandboxed module's execution environment by exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying system.\n\nIt is important to note that security cannot be achieved solely through mitigation measures such as segregation and isolation of code. Instead, it requires a combination of these and other measures, such as proper code review and testing, to identify and prevent security vulnerabilities.",
