            "model_answer": "Here is my reasoning:\n\nAdults 18 years or older: This includes adults aged 18-65, as they would have had time to gain and lose weight during their adult life.\nOverweight: I will use the term overweight to refer to having a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 25. According to the World Health Organization, a BMI greater than 25 is overweight and a BMI greater than 30 is considered obese.\nNumber of adults: There are approximately 325 million adults in the US.\nEstimated percentage of overweight adults: According to the most recent data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), about 38% of US adults had a BMI greater than 25. So, we can estimate that about 127 million adults are overweight.\nTotal number of adults: 325 million + 127 million = 458 million\nEstimated percentage of overweight adults among adults: 458 million / 326 million = 12.8%\nAnswer: Option B (20%)",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 when adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices, we need to first adjust the values for inflation and PPP.\n\nInflation: To adjust for inflation, we need to use the consumer price index from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI is an index that measures changes in the prices of consumer goods and services over time. We can use the inflation rate for 1850, which was approximately 4% per year, to calculate the adjusted value of each year's money.\n\nPPP: PPP is a method for adjusting per-capita income levels when purchasing power changes over time. For 2011 prices, the PPP is calculated by dividing the total consumer spending in the United States by the country's total population. We can use the PPP for 1850 to calculate the adjusted per-capita income.\n\nOnce we have adjusted the values for inflation and PPP, we can calculate the GDP per capita by dividing the adjusted total GDP by the adjusted population.\n\nBased on the data available, the most likely answer to the question is (C), about $8k. The adjusted values for inflation and PPP indicate that $8k in 1850 would have had the same purchasing power as $300 in 2011 prices.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "According to a 2019 Gallup poll, about 52% of people from the United States say that same-sex marriage should be accepted by society. This estimate is based on a sample size of 1, repeating interviews with a random sample of 1,035 U.S. adults.\n\nThis estimate is relatively close to the actual figure of 59% of all Americans who support same-sex marriage, according to a Pew Research Center poll taken in 2018. However, it is important to keep in mind that these polls are based on a sample size of only 800 or 1,200 people, respectively, and that the results may vary based on the exact methodology and questions used.\n\nIn addition, the Gallup poll asked specifically about attitudes toward same-sex marriage, while the Pew Research Center poll also included other questions related to attitudes toward LGBTQ+ people and issues. It is possible that the results of the two polls are not directly comparable.\n\nOverall, while the exact percentage of people from the United States who support same-sex marriage may vary depending on the sample size, poll methodology, and other factors, the median estimate suggests that a strong majority of people in the country support same-sex marriage.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The biggest cause of death in children under five years old (as of 2017) is due to lower respiratory infections. This is primarily caused by respiratory viruses such as pneumonia, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Influenza, and adenovirus. These infections can lead to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia, which can be fatal in young children.\n\nPreterm birth complications, such as spontaneous preterm labor and low birth weight, are also a major cause of death among children under five. Children born prematurely have an increased risk of hospitalization and death from respiratory infections and other childhood diseases.\n\nDiarrheal diseases, such as diarrhea caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites, are another significant cause of death among children under five. Diarrheal diseases can lead to dehydration and death if not treated quickly.\n\nMalaria, a mosquito-borne disease, is also a concern for children in developing countries, where it can cause severe and costly illness and death. The absence of proper insecticides and other measures to prevent mosquito bites can lead to increased transmission of malaria and increased risk of death among children.\n\nOverall, lower respiratory infections, preterm birth complications, diarrheal diseases, and malaria are the biggest causes of death in children under five years old in 2017. By understanding the risk factors and taking steps to prevent these infections, we can work to reduce the number of child deaths in this age group.",
