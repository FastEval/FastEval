            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The number of human polyomaviruses is unknown as they have not yet been fully characterized. At present, there are four known human polyomaviruses: BKPyV (BK virus), JCV (JohnCott virus), KIV (K isolate virus), and Merkel cell virus (MCV).\n\nBKPyV is a widespread virus that is commonly detected in the urine of healthy adults. JCV is a virus that is primarily transmitted through contact with contaminated soil or water, and is typically found in the brains of aging people. KIV is a virus that is commonly found in the saliva of people who smoke or chew tobacco, and is also associated with head and neck cancer. MCV, on the other hand, is a virus that is typically found in the stomach of patients with gastric cancer.\n\nTo date, none of the four human polyomaviruses has been linked to any specific disease, although BKPyV has been found to be responsible for several renal diseases in adults. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of human polyomaviruses in human health and disease.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The AIDS activism in the U.S. resulted in the following changes:\n\n1.\tFood and Drug Administration (FDA) reforms: The AIDS crisis led to significant reforms at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was created in 1938 to regulate the sale of goods intended for human consumption. The reforms included increasing the number of slow-moving products that go through the approval process, as well as mandating that all new drugs be proven to be effective and safe before they can be sold.\n\n2.\tEasier access to investigational drugs: The creation of the FDA also resulted in increased access to investigational drugs, which are also known as \" compassionate use.\" These drugs are not yet approved by the FDA and are typically used to treat advanced cases of AIDS or other serious diseases. Before the reforms, it was difficult for patients to gain access to these drugs, but under the new system, it is much easier for patients to request access to investigational drugs.\n\n3.\tChanges in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S.: The AIDS crisis also led to changes in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S. Physicians began to adopt a more aggressive approach to treating AIDS, and new courses were offered to train medical professionals to care for people with AIDS. As a result, the way medicine was practiced in the U.S. has changed significantly, and many medical professionals now have specialized training in caring for people with AIDS.\n\n4.\tAll of the above: Finally, the AIDS activism in the U.S. resulted in all of the above changes. The reforms at the Food and Drug Administration, the increase in access to investigational drugs, changes in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S., and the increased awareness and understanding of the impact of the AIDS crisis on society have all been important factors in the progress that has been made in the fight against AIDS.",

            "model_answer": "My reasoning is as follows:\n\n- Malaria is a tropical disease that is spread by mosquitos and other insects. mosquitos can transmit the infection to humans via a bite, thus making it a direct cause of death.\n- Tuberculosis is a bacteria that is spread through the air and can cause death if left untreated.\n- Respiratory infections like flu and pneumonia can cause death in older or sick individuals, as well as those with underlying medical conditions.\n- Diarrheal diseases can cause dehydration and other health issues, which can lead to death in young children or people with weakened immune systems.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that **A)** respiratory infections, **B)** diarrheal diseases, and **C)** tuberculosis are the most significant causes of death globally, and that **D)** malaria is a notable exception due to its transmission through mosquitos.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Innovators\nTo achieve effective change in a community requires adoption of innovative practices and development of new solutions to address the challenges facing the community. Innovators are typically individuals who are highly creative and have a deep understanding of the community's needs and problems. They are often willing to take risks and invest in new ideas and technologies to address the challenges.\n\n(B) Early adapters\nEarly adapters are individuals who are early adopters of new technologies, ideas, and practices. They are willing to try new things and are often the first to embrace new ideas and innovations. They are often risk-takers and are willing to take on the responsibility of experimentation and innovation.\n\n(C) Middle adapters\nMiddle adapters are individuals who are comfortable with the current state of the community and are not yet ready to fully adopt new practices or technologies. They are often thekeepers of the community's traditions and culture, and are resistant to change. However, they may be willing to experiment with new ideas and technologies under certain conditions.\n\n(D) Late adapters\nLatAdapters are individuals who are late adopters of new technologies, ideas, and practices. They are often resistant to change and are uncomfortable with the intrusion of new ideas and technologies into their community. They are often thestoppers of innovations and may prevent change from occurring in the community.\n\nThe final answer is A.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is \"C\". Contingency management is a strategy of last resort for reducing high-risk behaviors such as needle sharing andsyphilis transmission among intravenous drug users (IVDUs). This strategy involves paying IVDUs monetary incentives or rewarding them with redeemable vouchers for completing clinic visits, drug screens, and testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nContingency management has been shown to be effective in reducing high-risk behaviors among IVDUs. For instance, a study in Australia found that IVDUs who received monetary incentives for completing regular medical checks were less likely to share needles and engage in high-risk behaviors compared to those who received standard care.\n\nIn addition, contingent management has been shown to improve STI outcomes among IVDUs. A study in the United States found that IVDUs who received vouchers for practicing safe sex were more likely to use condoms consistently compared to those who received standard care.\n\nOverall, contingent management is a promising strategy for reducing high-risk behaviors and improving STI outcomes among IVDUs.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is \"C\".\n\nAstroviruses are a group of viruses that are relatively common in human populations and can cause a variety of symptoms, including diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Although some cases ofastrovirus infection can be severe and lead to hospitalization, most cases of infection are relatively mild and can be managed with supportive care and antibiotics.\n\nIn contrast to other coronaviral infections, such as SARS and MERS, astroviruses are typically not transmitted between humans, and the disease can be transmitted through contaminated food or water. The symptoms of astrovirus infection can vary depending on the type of virus that is involved, but typically include acute symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.\n\nInfiltrativeenteritis is a form of autoimmune enteritis that primarily affects the small intestine and causes inflammation and damage to the walls of the small intestine. This type of autoimmune enteritis is often associated with celiac disease and other autoimmune conditions, and can be caused by a variety of factors, including inflammation of the bowel from other diseases and medications.\n\nIn conclusion, given the symptoms of astrovirus infection and the association with other autoimmune conditions, infiltrativeenteritis is a likely diagnosis in a patient who presents with symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting.",
