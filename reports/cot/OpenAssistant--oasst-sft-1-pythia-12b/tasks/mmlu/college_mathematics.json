            "model_answer": "Sure. To solve for x in the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0, we can apply the substitution method. We will start by moving all constants to the right hand side and all x terms to the left hand side. This gives us the following equation:\n\ne^x + x - 2 = 0\n-2e^x + x = 0\nx^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\n\nWe can now apply the quadratic formula to solve for x. The solutions are:\nx = -0.5 \u00b1 \u221a(1.5)i\nx = 0.5 \u00b1 \u221a(1.5)i\n\nBased on the choices provided, we can determine that (C) is the only valid solution. The number of real solutions that are not in [0, 1] is equal to the number of roots that are outside of the interval [0, 1], which in this case is 1.",

A compact space is a metrizable space, meaning that it has a compatible covering by open sets that Approach Zero.\n\nA complete space is a space that is complete with respect to some topology.
