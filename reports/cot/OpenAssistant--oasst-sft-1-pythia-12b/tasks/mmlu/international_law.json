            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "A. Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders. It means that if there is a violation of a right, there is a possibility for the relevant rights holders to bring an action in the courts to enforce that right. The meaning of justiciability is similar to that of enforceability, which refers to the ability of the courts to hear and decide cases.\n\nB. Justiciability refers to the just nature or cause of a particular right. It means that the right must have somejust cause or reason for not being enforced. For example, a right may not be justiciable if it is not supported by any evidence or if it is arbitrary or intentional.\n\nC. Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular rights conforms to principles of justice. This means that the courts may consider factors such as the nature of the right, the harm caused by its non-enforcement, and the interests of all parties involved in the dispute.\n\nD. Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular Right. It means that a State has a legal duty to protect and guarantee the rights of its citizens, and failure to do so may result in legal action.",

            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is a concept in international law that underscores the right and responsibility of states to protect their citizens from genocide, war crimes, and other serious human rights abuses committed by other states or non-State actors.\n\nIn contrast to humanitarian intervention, which is a reactive measure to protect human lives in war zones, R2P involves proactive steps by states to prevent or respond to conflics or crises when their citizens are at risk of genocide, war crimes, or other human rights abuses.\n\nThe differences between R2P and humanitarian intervention lie in the nature of the conflict, the level of international cooperation required, and the rules and standards that govern the use of force. In a R2P scenario, the state in question often requests assistance from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) or other international organizations, and the use of force may be authorized if the state demonstrates a failure to take necessary steps to protect its citizens. In contrast, humanitarian intervention is a unilateral measure that is often carried out without the authorization of the UNSC or other international organizations, and the use of force may be authorized if it is deemed necessary to protect human lives in a specific conflict zone.\n\nOverall, R2P is different from humanitarian intervention in that it involves a more proactive and structured approach to preventing and responding to serious human rights abuses, and it requires international cooperation and authorization to use force.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "We can consider the answer choices A, B and C together as forming a set of mutually exclusive options.\n\nUnder the logic of A, the principle would state that unless a state has explicitly prohibited jurisdiction via a legal instrument, then that jurisdiction is valid for all states. This could include territories like the high seas. However, it is important to note that only a few states have explicitly prohibited jurisdiction on the high seas.\n\nUnder the logic of B, the principle would state that States are free to choose the court that they will submit their disputes to. In other words, there is no inherent right to a certain court and States are free to select one that they believe is suitable. However, it is important to note that there are certain international tribunals that have been established specifically to hear disputes involving States.\n\nUnder the logic of C, the principle would state that customary law is derived from the combination of State practice and opinio juris. This could mean that customary law is a hybrid of both regulatory law and legal positivism. On the one hand, it is derived from State practice and is based onVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. However, on the other hand, it is also grounded in international opinio juris, which allows States to expand or contract the scope of customary law based on their own interests and values.",

It was adopted by the people of the United Kingdom in a referendum on 6 June 1922 and came into force on 1 October 1922. It is made up of four main parts: the Treaty of Union (between the UK and Ireland), the British Common Law, the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nIn terms of the powers of the UK Constitution, it commits the government to certain fundamental principles such as the rule of law and the protection of individual liberties, but does not specify exactly how these powers should be exercised. Instead, the powers are delegated to the various institutions of the UK, such as the House of Commons, the House of Lords, the judiciary and the monarch, through a series of laws and constitutional amendments.\n\nIt is important to note that while the UK Constitution forms the basis of the political and legal systems in the UK, it is not a legislative document and does not have the power to make law itself.

Rocks are the islands that are less than 10 square miles.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\nUnder the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), \"rocks\" are defined as islands that are less than 10 square miles in area. This definition reflects the general understanding that islands that are less than 10 square miles in area are not capable of supporting significant human populations or economic activity.\n\nAdditionally, article 121(3) of UNCLOS provides that, in the case of islands that cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own, their territorial waters and exclusive economic zone shall be determined according to their governing law or conventions. In the absence of any governing law or convention, the territorial waters and exclusive economic zone of such islands shall be determined based on their size and their ability to sustain human habitation or economic life.\n\nBased on these factors, it is clear that rocks are not included among the categories of islands defined in UNCLOS as those that can sustain human habitation or economic life, and therefore the best choice is **A**.",
