            "question": "Which State ordinarily exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels?\n\n(A) The coastal State\n(B) The flag State\n(C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction\n(D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C). All States enjoy such jurisdiction aboard vessels registered in the flag State. The term \"such jurisdiction\" is a reference to the Hamburg visualization principle, which holds that \"the jurisdiction of a state extends to the high seas as far as the limits of its territorial sea.\" The territorial sea of a state is the area of ocean within its sovereignty, including all inland bodies of water up to three nautical miles from its coastline.\n\nThe Hamburg visualization principle arose as a result of the Minihane Treaty of 1974, which recognized the sovereign jurisdiction of states over their waters and airspace, and established the principle that states must exercise jurisdiction in their waters in a uniform and consistent manner. The treaty applies to all vessels, including those flying under the flag of another state.\n\nThe United Nations International Court of Justice has also recognized that all States have jurisdiction over crimes committed aboard vessels registered in their territory. In the case Human Rights in the Sea, the Court emphasized that \"the flag State has jurisdiction over the vessel and its crew under international law, and is responsible for ensuring [that] the vessel and its crew are treated humanely.\"\n\nTherefore, all States exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels registered in their territory, regardless of the flag state of the vessel.",

            "question": "What is the meaning of justiciability?\n\n(A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders\n(B) Justiciability refers to the just nature or cause of a particular right\n(C) Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular rights conforms to principles of justice\n(D) Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular Right",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: (C) Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of Whether the non-enforcement of a particular rights conforms to principles of justice.\n\nThis is because \"justice\" is a broad concept that can relate to a wide range of legal principles, including the rights of individuals and the principles of fairness and equality. When a court assesses whether a non-enforcement of a particular right conforms to principles of justice, it is making a legal determination about how the law should be applied in a specific situation. This involves considering whether the non-enforcement of the right is justified under the law, and whether it violates any of the rights of the affected parties.\n\nIn other words, justiciability is a legal concept that examines the basis for judicial action and the court's power to address legal issues. It is concerned with ensuring that courts have the ability to enforce and protect rights and promote justice in a given situation.",

            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D). R2P is a more formal process that involves UNSC authorization and the use of force when needed to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, or other crimes against humanity. It differs from humanitarian intervention in that it is a more targeted and controlled approach, with a longer timeline and a greater emphasis on legal accountability.",

            "question": "What is the 'Lotus principle'?\n\n(A) The so-called Lotus principle is that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', or, as it has been construed, 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law'\n(B) The so-called Lotus principle is that States are free to choose the Court that they will submit their disputes\n(C) The so-called Lotus principle is that States are not prohibited to assert their enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas\n(D) The so-called Lotus principle is that customary law derives from the combination of State practice and opinio juris",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The so-called Lotus principle is that States are free to choose the Court that they will submit their disputes.\n\nThere are three aspects of the question that can be analyzed:\n\n1. The meaning of the term \"Lotus principle\".\n2. What is meant by \"submit their disputes\".\n3. Whether the principle applies to all disputes, including those occurring on the high seas or only those involving States.\n\nOn the first aspect, the Lotus principle is claimed to be a maxim of international law by which States are free to choose the Court that will hear their disputes, without being inhibited by domestic or international legal principles. The premise of the maxim is that resolving conflicts through international courts is often the most effective and efficient means of addressing them.\n\nOn the second aspect, the term \"submit their disputes\" can be interpreted in various ways. One possible interpretation is that States are free to submit their disputes to any international court that is willing to hear them, regardless of the court's jurisdiction or the merits of the dispute. Another interpretation is that States are free to submit their disputes to any court that is established under a Geneva Convention or other international treaty, regardless of the court's jurisdiction or the merits of the dispute.\n\nOn the third aspect, the Lotus principle may not apply to all disputes. Some argue that it only applies to disputes between States and that non-State entities, such as corporations or individuals, are not bound by the principle. Others argue that the principle applies to all disagreements, regardless of their origin or location, and that it represents a fundamental principle of international law that is universally recognized.\n\nIn summary, the meaning of the \"Lotus principle\" is a matter of debate and interpretation, with different interpretations differing on its scope and application. Whether the principle applies to all disputes, including those occurring on the high seas or only those involving States, is also a matter of debate.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D).\n\n Protocol 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which entered into force on November 4, 1953, gave the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) the power to examine requests for intervention by national courts and to determine whether or not they comply with the European Convention.\n\nPrior to Protocol 14, the Committee of Three (COT) heard requests for intervention and made recommendations to the European Commission of Human Rights (ECoH) on whether or not to grant them. The COT was chaired by a judge from each of the member states, with one judge appointed as prosecutor and the other as rapporteur.\n\nUnder the new treaty, however, the ECtHR was established as the sole court with jurisdiction to hear and determine requests for intervention. The Court is now composed of 26 judges, who are appointed by the Council of the European Union on the recommendation of the President of the European Commission.\n\nThe addition of a new criterion foradmissibility was intended to ensure that requests for intervention are submitted in a prompt and organized manner, rather than being submitted at a late stage of the proceedings. This criterion requires that requests for intervention be submitted within a reasonable period of time after the incident or infringement of rights in question.\n\nThe abolition of the Commission of Human Rights was intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Court's work. The Commission was established in 1993 and was charged with promoting and monitoring the implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nHowever, many human rights activists and observers have criticized the Commission of Human Rights, arguing that it is inefficient and often fails to act upon complaints. They argue that the Commission's work is biased in favor of politically sensitive cases and that its recommendations are often ignored or rejected by the member states.\n\nIn conclusion, Protocol 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights abolished the Commission of Human Rights and established the ECTHR as the sole court with jurisdiction to hear and determine requests for intervention. The addition of a new criterion foradmissibility was intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Court's work, while the abolition of the Commission of Human Rights was intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Court's work.",
