Despite this, he pursued the help, taking unnecessary risks and putting himself in danger in order to help his friend. This shows a lack of loyalty and trust toward his friend, and may indicate that the main character is not operating according to his own moral principles.\n\nOverall, given the specific circumstances of this case, it seems that the main character has done something that is morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
