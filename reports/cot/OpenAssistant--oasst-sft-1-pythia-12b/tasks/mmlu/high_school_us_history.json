In its magnificent domain of space and time, the nation of many nations is destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles; to establish on earth the noblest temple ever dedicated to the worship of the Most High\u2014the Sacred and the True. Its floor shall be a hemisphere\u2014its roof the firmament of the star-studded heavens, and its congregation a Union of many Republics, comprising hundreds of happy millions, calling, owning no man master, but governed by God's natural and moral law of equality, the law of brotherhood\u2014of 'peace and good will amongst men.'\"\nJohn L. O'Sullivan, \"The Great Nation of Futurity,\" 1839\nBy what means did the United States take possession of the Oregon Territory?\n\n(A) The United States was granted the territory in a postwar treaty with France.\n(B) The United States bought it from the Native Americans who lived there.\n(C) U.S. settlers were the first to arrive in the region; they claimed it for their country.\n(D) Great Britain ceded it to the United States as part of a negotiated treaty.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: **C**.\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the United States was eager to secure its western territories and expand its borders. One of the approaches the U.S. government took was to encourage settlement in the Oregon Territory, which was then under the control of the British Empire.\n\nIn 1819, the U.S. Congress authorized the purchase of land from the Native American tribes in the area, with the intent of transferring ownership to U.S. citizens and establishing permanent settlement. Later that year, however, the British government declared that it would no longer recognize American claims to the region, and would instead defend its interests in the area.\n\nIn response, the U.S. government purchased the land from the British directly, using money from the federal treasury. This effectively left the United States in control of the territory, and marked the beginning of U.S. settlement in the region.\n\nOver the next several years, U.S. settlers began to arrive in the area, and by 1843, the region had become home to several small settlements. In 1846, the U.S. government established the Oregon Territory as a separate territory, and in 1848, it became the home of the first U.S. territorial legislature.\n\nToday, the Oregon Territory remains an important part of the United States, serving as the site of several military bases and as a center for trade and industry. Its place in American history as the site of the first permanent settlement by the United States and as a center for exploration and settlement serves as a reminder of the importance of expansion and the determination of the United States to secure its borders and maintain its territorial interests.",

The Charters affirmed the right of Pennsylvania citizens to freely exercise their religious beliefs and practices, and provided new protections against religious persecution.\n\nOne of the key aspects of the Charters was the guarantee of religious freedom, which stated that \"no Person or Persons, inhabiting in this Province or Territories, who shall confess and acknowledge One almighty God, the Creator, Upholder and Ruler of the World; and profess him or themselves obliged to live quietly under the Civil Government, shall be in any Case molested or prejudiced, in his or their Person or Estate, because of his or their conscientious Persuasion or Practice, nor be compelled to frequent or maintain any religious Worship, Place or Ministry, contrary to his or their Mind.\"\n\nThis guarantee of religious freedom was revolutionary for the time, and it helped to lay the foundation for the eventual Establishment of the United States of America as a Christian nation. By reserving the right of people to freely exercise their religious beliefs, Penn and his agents established a precedent that would be important for future generations as they worked to protect the right to religious freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, the Penn Charters of Privileges were significant for guaranteeing the right of Pennsylvania citizens to freely exercise their religious beliefs, and for laying the foundation for the eventual Establishment of the United States as a Christian nation.",

Among other things, the law established a national quota system for immigration and made it much more difficult for aliens to become citizens.

            "model_answer": "A. President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced that he would not run for re-election in 1940. This decision played a major role in the outcome of the presidential election and helped boost Harry S. Truman's chances of becoming president.\n\nB. Launching the Second New Deal, a series of legislative acts including Social Security, was one of President Roosevelt's most significant actions during his time in office. The act provided assistance to individuals affected by the Great Depression and established the Social Security program, which provides retirement benefits to current and former workers.\n\nC. Diverting people's attention by allowing the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor was a controversial move that polarised opinion during the war. While it was a strategic mistake, it did serve to distract the US from its involvement in Europe and helped to prevent mid-1941 US entry into the war.\n\nD. Urging Congress to cut taxes and deregulate the economy was one of President Roosevelt's most popular policies during the Great Depression. His effort to reduce the burden of taxes and regulations on businesses led to significant economic growth and helped to pull the USA out of the Great Depression.\n\nOverall, President Roosevelt's response to the challenge posed by Senator Long was a combination of actions that addressed the shared concerns of the American people and helped to maintain the momentum of the New Deal.",
