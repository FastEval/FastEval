            "model_answer": "Type Ia supernovae are an important type of supernova that plays a key role in the evolution of the stars in our galaxy and the universe. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the different statements in the question:\n\nA: This statement is true for a type-Ia supernova (SN Type-Ia). Type-Ia supernovae are known for their distinctive properties, such as the high peak brightness and the bright afterglow that persists for several days. They are believed to result from the collapse of a white dwarf (WD) in a binary system, where the primary star supplies the material for the WD to consume and eventually turn into a SN.\n\nB: This statement is not true for a type-Ia supernova. Young galaxies, such as star-forming regions, contain a lot of young stars and are therefore likely to witness many SN Type-Ia. However, not all galaxies have a recent history of star formation, and old galaxies like the Milky Way do not contain any young stars that could potentially trigger a SN Type-Ia.\n\nC: This statement is not true for a type-Ia supernova. GRBs are intense bursts of high-energy radiation that are typically associated with the collapse of a very massive star into a black hole. While Type-Ia supernovae are also violent events that involve the collapse of a massive star, they are not as intense or short-lived as GRBs.\n\nD: This statement is not true for a type-Ia supernova. X-rays are high-energy radiation that are typically produced by gas heated by the collapse of a massive star. While Type-Ia supernovae can produce large amounts of X-rays, they are not the only source of X-rays. Other sources of X-rays include black holes, pulsars, and active galaxies.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C). The sky appears blue because the Rayleigh scattering effect causes light with shorter wavelengths to be scattered more than light with longer wavelengths. This is due to the fact that shorter wavelengths are quickly scattered in all directions, while longer wavelengths are scattered in a smaller angle. The result is that blue light from the sky is scattered more than other colors, making the sky appear blue.",

            "model_answer": "(A) Titan is the only outer solar system moon with a thick atmosphere\n\nTitan is the only moon in the outer solar system known to have a thick atmosphere, composed primarily of nitrogen and methane. This is in contrast to the other four moons in the outer solar system, including Earth, which have thin atmospheres composed of nitrogen, oxygen, and other gases. The thick atmosphere of Titan is thought to be due to a process called atmospheric collapse, which occurred early in its history when its original atmosphere was destroyed by the impact of a smaller moon.\n\nThere is some evidence that Titan may have experienced recent geologic activity, including geologic mapping and evidence of lava flows on its surface. Additionally, there are several potential impact sites on Titan caused by the collision of small bodies with the moon, including areas currently covered in ice.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that Titan is the only outer solar system moon with a thick atmosphere, and that its atmosphere was likely formed as a result of atmospheric collapse following the destruction of its original atmosphere.",

Multiplying both parts together gives us the total energy released, m*v.\n\n(B) 0.5*m/(R^3)\nThe second part of the equation, m/(R^3), contains a division that results in a quantity equal to 0.5.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is **C**.\n\nTo answer this question, we first need to understand how we can determine the age of rocks on the Moon and Earth. There are several methods for measuring rock age, but one of the most common is radiometric dating. Radiometric dating uses the radioactivity present in rocks to measure their age.\n\nLunar rocks are made up of many small pieces of rock that have been pulverized by many impacts. Because of this, lunar rocks are highly contaminated with radioactive elements, such as carbon-14 and oxygen-16. By measuring the amount of these radioactive elements in lunar rocks, we can determine their age.\n\nRadioactive dating works on the principle that as radioactive elements decay, they produce other elements, such as carbon and oxygen. By measuring the amount of carbon and oxygen in lunar rocks, we can determine how much of each element has decayed over time.\n\nThe decay rates of radioactive elements are known, and we can use these rates to calculate the age of lunar rocks. By measuring the amount of carbon and oxygen in lunar rocks, we can determine their age, which is older on the Moon than on the Earth.\n\nOne reason for the difference in age is that the Moon is a much smaller object than the Earth, and therefore has experienced a greater number of impacts over time. This has caused the Moon to be significantly contaminated with radioactive elements, which helps to explain why its rocks are older than those on the Earth.\n\nAdditionally, the Moon's surface is more heavily eroded than the Earth's surface, and this has further contributed to the difference in age of lunar rocks. The intense erosional activity on the Moon's surface has caused many of the lunar rocks to break down into smaller pieces, which makes them easier to measure and analyze.\n\nOverall, we can conclude that the Moon's rocks are older than those on the Earth's surface, due to the greater number of impacts and the more heavily eroded surface of the Moon. This provides strong evidence for the theory of lunar rock formation and decay, which is one of the key insights that led to the discovery of the Moon.",

Based on current data, the most likely explanation for this curious phenomenon is the digestion of Comet 67P/Cpone by the sun's UV radiation. While the exact details remain a subject of scientific discussion, the consensus is that the release of methane gas via dehydration reactions within the comet's nucleus has caused its rotation to gradually accelerate over time.",

            "model_answer": "The source of the material that causes meteor showers is most likely asteroid impact. Near-Earth asteroids are a common source of meteoroids, and they occasionally impact the Earth. When an asteroid enters the Earth's atmosphere, it can fragment into many smaller pieces that travel at high speeds. When these pieces enter the Earth's atmosphere, they create a meteor shower.\n\nAsteroid impact can occur either when the asteroid enters the Earth's atmosphere directly, or when it passes through the Earth's gravitational field and falls back to the ground. The impact itself can create a cloud of dust and debris that is visible from Earth as a meteor shower.\n\nBased on the available information, I conclude that the source of the material that causes meteor showers is asteroid impact.",
