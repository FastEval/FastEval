What should you recommend?\n\n(A) Quickly investigate to make certain your product is definitely the cause of the illness.\n(B) Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product.\n(C) Stop sales of the product in the Albany, New York, market and issue a recall for that product.\n(D) Issue a press release to the Albany, New York, market explaining how to treat the symptoms.",

            "model_answer": "The best course of action in this situation is to immediately fully investigate the situation and take all necessary corrective actions. This should include contacting the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure that the recall process is proceeding as safely and efficiently as possible. \n\nIf it is determined that your product is indeed the source of the illness, then the appropriate course of action is to stop all sales of the product and issue a recall. \n\nIf you determine that your product is not the source of the illness and that it is safe to continue selling it, then a press release to inform the general public of that fact would be appropriate. This would prevent unnecessary public panic and concerns, and provide a clear and concise explanation of the situation.",

The people who hold these opinions may be afraid to share them for fear of being ostracized or criticized, or they may simply not want to engage in discussions that may be difficult or conflictual.\n\nIn contrast, the other three definitions may be more appropriate in certain situations, such as when dealing with sensitive or confidential information or when seeking to align beliefs or opinions with a majority.
