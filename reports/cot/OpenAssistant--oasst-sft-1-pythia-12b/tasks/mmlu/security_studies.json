            "model_answer": "The principle that responsibility for preventing harm lies with the person or entity that creates the danger is not a principle of the responsibility to protect. Responsibility for preventing harm is a fundamental responsibility of individuals, organizations, and societies, and it falls outside the scope of the responsibility to protect.\n\nThe principles of the responsibility to protect are:\n\nThe duty to protect\nThe duty to provide assistance\nThe duty to intervene\nThe duty to submit to authority\nThe duty to account for damages\nThe duty to prevent harm.\n\nThe responsibility to protect does not include the role of preventing harm, but rather the responsibility to respond to harm when it occurs and to take measures to prevent further harm. Taking action to prevent harm requires responsibility and accountability, whereas implementing preventative measures does not.\n\nTherefore, the principle that responsibility for preventing harm lies with the person or entity that creates the danger is not a principle of the responsibility to protect.",

            "question": "Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\n\n(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Option A is correct. Economic factors can play a role in determining military power, and environmental changes can put pressure on economic growth and create job vacancies in industries related to environmental protection and conservation. Decision-makers may use these opportunities to diversify their economies and develop new technologies that can contribute to military modernization.\n\nOption B is incorrect. The relationship between the environment and national security is complex and multifaceted, and environmental challenges can have both positive and negative effects on national security. In some cases, environmental changes can create economic stress and distract from defense priorities, but in other cases, they can provide opportunities for innovation and development that can enhance military capabilities.\n\nOption C is incorrect. International cooperation and collaboration can play a critical role in addressing environmental problems, and countries can work together to develop and implement policies and initiatives that promote sustainability and protect the environment. However, the external nature of environmental challenges means that they cannot be fully resolved without addressing broader international issues, such as poverty, inequality, and political instability.\n\nOption D is partially correct. While all of the options listed address the relationship between the environment and national security, Option D focuses on the economic factors that can impact national security and does not address the broader international issues that are necessary to fully address environmental problems. Additionally, the final line of Option D contains unnecessary information, as a single letter with parenthesis is sufficient to convey the correct answer.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Security studies is a broad interdisciplinary field that studies security, broadly defined as the interdependence and interactions among political, economic, social, ecological, and technological systems. The academic disciplines that fall under the security studies umbrella include political science, international relations, economics, and other social sciences. \n\nSecurity studies has been marked by a gradual shift towards the study of security through the lens of international relations and political science. Rather than focusing exclusively on strategic issues such as military capabilities and policy decisions, security studies investigates the interdependence of political, economic, social, ecological, and technological systems, and how these systems interact with one another. This has resulted in the development of new frameworks and theories, as well as the integration of different academic disciplines.\n\nIR has also played a significant role in the development of security studies. International relations has provided a context for the study of security, as it focuses on the relationships and interactions among states and nations. Additionally, IR has helped to develop a cross-disciplinary understanding of security, as different academic disciplines can contribute to the study of security through their unique perspectives and areas of expertise.\n\nOverall, the institutionalization of academe-policy interaction has led to the development of a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary understanding of security, as well as the integration of different academic disciplines within the field.",

Conversely, social constructivists regard this as an unhelpful regression to positivist binary frameworks of analysis.\n\nTo elaborate on my answer:\nSocial constructivism is a theoretical framework that equally values both social reality and the subjective experiences of individuals. The starting point of social constructivism is the recognition that people do not live in objective reality but in their subjective interpretations of that reality. A central concept in social constructivism is the idea that social reality is created and maintained through language, social interaction and collective beliefs.\nThe approach to social constructivism varies depending on the theoretical perspective of the researcher. constructivists can be classified into two main groups: those who believe that social reality can be best understood as a product of the (re)actions of social actors and those who believe that social reality is defined by a shared social understanding.\ncritical constructivists argue that the notion of social reality as being 1) objective and 2) created through the actions of social actors is ahistorical and simplistic. They argue that social reality is made up of a complex web of interconnected meanings and that the meaning of social reality is not discovered but created through social discourse and practice. Central to the critical constructivist approach is the rejection of any attempt to create a dichotomous distinction between \u2018objective\u2019 and \u2018subjective\u2019 reality.\nOn the other hand, social constructivists recognize the importance of using the scientific method and positivistic methodologies in their work. They argue that social science research provides valuable knowledge about social reality and that positivistic techniques can help to generate testable theories and explanations.\nIn conclusion, critical constructivists argue that the notion of social reality as being created and maintained through language, social interaction and collective beliefs is ahistorical and simplistic, while social constructivists recognize the importance of using the scientific method and positivistic methodologies in their work.",
