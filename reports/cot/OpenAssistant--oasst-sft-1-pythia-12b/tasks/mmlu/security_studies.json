            "model_answer": "(B) The responsibility to react.\n\nThe principle of responding to danger is an essential aspect of responsibility, but it does not on its own imply a responsibility to protect. As long as an individual or entity can respond to a danger without placing themselves in further danger, they have fulfilled their responsibility to react but not their responsibility to protect.\n\nProtecting others requires a broader, proactive approach that involves taking steps to minimize the risk of harm and to respond to any potential threats or crises. This may involve providing assistance to those in need, promoting public safety and security, and advocating for policies and laws that promote safety and protection.\n\nIn short, while responding to danger is important, protecting others requires a deeper commitment and a broader set of responsibilities.",

            "question": "Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\n\n(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",

This however both bolsters national security and foreign policy and is not a clear distinction. B) doesn't take into account that the environment can be disrupted in a way that has unpredictable consequences. While a long-term negative impact on an economy may result in technological advancements that are helpful in national security It does not necessarily follow that environmental changes that have predictable negative consequences on a specific sector of the economy will also have predictable positive consequences on national security. C) is a worst case scenario that could have negative impacts on both national interests and foreign policy. While it may be true that external environmental challenges will result in an erosion in a countries natural capital base there is little indication that that will result in an erosion of their foreign policy, particularly if external challenges evaporate or are mitigated without serious cost to the country. D) acknowledges that there are complications with considering internal and external environmental challenges but does not provide much aid in resolving them.\n\nBased on the clarification I would answer option D).",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Based on my understanding of the concept of human security, I would say that option (C) is a common criticism. Human security is often criticized for being too broad and encompassing a wide range of issues, including poverty, inequality, and environmental concerns. This can make it difficult to define and implement a clear and effective strategy to protect human security. Additionally, some argue that humansecurity ideas can perpetuate outdated and harmful forms of colonialism and capitalism. It is important to recognize the limitations of the human security concept and work to refine and improve it in order to effectively address the needs and concerns of people around the world.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "A) Business networks\n\nBusiness networks traditionally consists of networking equipment such as routers and switches which provide the infrastructure for routing data between different devices in an organization. An attacker targeting a business network would not necessarily need to be a computer expert or professional as they may be able to gain unauthorized access to the network using tools and techniques commonly available to anyone with access to the network.\n\nB) Computer experts\n\nComputer experts are individuals with specialized knowledge and skills in the fields of computer science, network technology, and other related areas. They are often employed by corporations, organizations, and government entities to develop and implement security policies, designs, and systems to prevent cyber-attacks. However, computer experts are not required to form part of the technical discourse on cyber-security and are not typically involved in day-to-day operations of cyber-security systems.\n\nC) Anti-virus industry\n\nThe anti-virus industry is a sector of the technology industry which provides software and other computer tools designed to detect and remove viruses and other malware from computer systems. While it is true that the anti-virus industry plays an important role in preventing computer attacks, the concept of cyber-security is much broader and involves a range of measures designed to protect against various forms of cyber-attacks, including those that do not involve the use of computer viruses.\n\nD) Computer networks\n\nComputer networks, on the other hand, are the infrastructure that connects computing devices, such as servers, workstations, and printers, together to form a network. An attacker seeking to target a computer network would likely be a computer professional or expert who would have knowledge of network security and the latest threats and vulnerabilities. In contrast, the technical discourse on cyber-security typically refers to the specific systems, processes, and policies used to protect computer networks and their operating systems and software against cyber-attacks.",

Conversely, critical constructivists argue that this approach simply reproduces the binary distinctions that characterize positivist methodology.\n(B) Critical constructivism regards the strength of social constructivism to be its ability to bridge rationalist and reflectivity approaches. Conversely, social constructivists regard this as an unhelpful regression to positivist binary frameworks of analysis.\n(C) Conventional constructivism refers to the earlier works of social constructivist theorists that are characterised by a rejection of positivist methodology. Critical constructivists challenge these theories, embracing positivist methodologies in their work.\n(D) Social constructivism is best understood as a uniform approach to the construction of social identities and security; although distinctions exist within the field, these are not easily defined as distinctive separate approaches.",

Social constructivists acknowledge that there are multiple discursive realities that cannot be reduced to binary categories and that there can be multiple interpretations of reality.\n\n\nOption B is incorrect because social constructivism is not solely a rejection of positivist methodology. Social constructivists propose that knowledge is constructed through interaction and that scientific knowledge is just one type of knowledge that is constructed through particular social processes and conventions.\n\n\nOption C is incorrect because there is no such thing as a uniform approach to the construction of social identities and security. Social constructivists emphasize the role of power, ideology, and symbolic meaning in shaping social reality and the impact of policies, stereotypes, and other forms of social differentiation on the lives and identities of individuals.\n\n\nOption D is incorrect because critical constructivists do not regard social constructivism as a uniform approach to the construction of social identities and security.
