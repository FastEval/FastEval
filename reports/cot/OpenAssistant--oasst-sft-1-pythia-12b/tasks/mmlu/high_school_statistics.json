            "model_answer": "In order to find the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders, we need to calculate the probability that the ride takes less than a certain amount of time.\n\nWe can calculate this probability using the distribution function of the waiting times. The distribution function is given by:\n\nf(x) = N(x; 35, 10), where N(x; parameters) is the normal distribution with mean parameter x and standard deviation parameter parameters\n\nWe can use this distribution function to calculate the probability that the ride takes less than a certain amount of time. For example, the probability that the ride takes less than 31.7 minutes is given by:\n\nP(T < 31.7) = f(31.7) = N(31.7; 35, 10)\n\nWe can then calculate the values of x where the probability is equal to 0.5 (50%), 0.1 (10%), 0.01 (1%), and 0.001 (0.1%). These values are:\n\nx = 31.7, 28.7, 25.3, and 24.3\n\nNow we can use these values to find the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders. The shortest time interval is the one that corresponds to the value of x that gives the highest probability. In this case, the shortest time interval is 25.3 to 35 minutes.",

Additionally, the mean, which is an average of the possible outcomes, must also be numerical. This rules out statement (A).\n(B) Statement (B) ensures that the possible outcomes are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one outcome can occur at a time.\n(C) The formula for the expected value can be written as:\n\nE(X) = \u03a3(Xi)p(Xi)\n\nHere, Xi represents the possible outcome for random variable X and p(Xi) is the probability of this outcome. Since the mean is the average of the possible outcomes, we can replace X with mean(X) in this formula to get:\n\nE(X) = \u03a3(Mi)p(Mi)\n\nwhere Mi is the average of the possible outcomes. From this, we can see that the formula for the mean assumes that the probabilities add to 1, which is not always the case for discrete random variables. This eliminates statement (C).\n(D) Statement (D) relates the mean and standard deviation of a sample of observations to the population mean and standard deviation. It states that for a large enough sample size, approximately 95% of the observations will be within two standard deviations of the population mean.\n\nHowever, discrete random variables do not have a population mean or standard deviation, as the mean and variance only apply to samples of observations drawn from the distribution. For a discrete random variable X, the mean is simply the integer midpoint of the range of possible outcomes, and the variance is 0. This eliminates statement (D) as well.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that remains true for all discrete random variables is (E), which states that the probabilities of the possible outcomes must add to 1.",

A larger power means that we are more confident in our findings and are more likely to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.\n\nTo answer the question, let's first define our terms:\n\nThe null hypothesis is, in fact, false. This means that the researchers are NOT expecting to find a true effect and are simply performing an experiment to test their null hypothesis.\n\nThe significance level is set at 0.05.
