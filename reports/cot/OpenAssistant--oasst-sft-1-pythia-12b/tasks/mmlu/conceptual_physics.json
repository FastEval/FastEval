            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Let's start with A. A completely submerged object always displaces its own weight of fluid. Fluid is an amnestic that do not remember it's state after being in a different state. Therefore a submerged object will not push down on the fluid that it displaced, and thus it's weight will remain at it's initial state.\n\nB. This one makes no sense. A volume of fluid is the space that it occupies, but a completely submerged object does not occupy any space. Furthermore a completely submerged object would not cause a change in the volume of the fluid since it would not push on the fluid in the first place.\n\nC. Density of fluid refers to the amount of mass per unit volume. Since a submerged object does not take up space and since fluid does not remember its state after being in a different state, the density of the fluid would be the same no matter whether the object was submerged or not. By the logic above, the weight of the submerged object would also be the same.\n\nTherefore the only way to answer this correctly is to say A.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0 on a three-dimensional sphere, including on planet Earth. This is because the sphere is curved, and each angle is defined as the sum of the angles opposite to it on the same plane. On a flat surface, however, the angles of a triangle add up to less than 180\u00b0 \u2013 in particular, if two of the angles are 90\u00b0 or 270\u00b0, the third angle must be less than 90\u00b0.\n\nIn order to prove this, we can use the law of cosines:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 \u2013 2abcos(C)\n\nwhere c is the length of the hypotenuse, a is the length of one of the legs, and b is the length of the other leg. Setting C to be the angle between the two legs that are opposite to the hypotenuse, we have:\n\ncosC = a/c, a^2 + b^2 \u2013 2abcosC = c^2 \u2013 b^2 = c^2 \u2013 (b^2 \u2013 a^2)\n\nTherefore, cosC is either equal to 1 (if a and b are the same length) or less than 1 (if a and b are unequal lengths). Since the sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180\u00b0, it follows that the angle between the hypotenuses must be less than 180\u00b0 in the case where the legs are unequal lengths. So option (C) is the only option that can satisfy this condition.\n\nIn conclusion, on a four-dimensional sphere, the angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0 for any triangle, including on planet Earth.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Overall, the effects of massive objects on spacetime and the behavior of light near a black hole are described by general relativity. Specifically, the theory predicts that massive objects will deform the spacetime around them and that light will be bent by the massive object's gravity. The exact influence of gravity on light will depend on the distance between the observer and the massive object.\n\nIn Question (A), the idea that mass distorts spacetime is a fundamental aspect of general relativity. However, this does not mean that mass in itself is responsible for spacetime curvature. Rather, it is the presence of matter or energy that drives the curvature of spacetime.\n\nFor example, if you were to hold a piece of rubber in your hand, it would not deform spacetime due to its mass. Instead, the mass of the rubber would actually act as a source of gravity, causing the surrounding fabric of spacetime to bend in its presence.\n\nSimilarly, in Question (B), it is the presence of gravity, rather than the mass of the object, that is causing the observer's clock to run slower than it would be in a vacuum. This is due to the influence of gravity on the motion of clock hands and other objects within the gravitational field.\n\nQuestion (C) is based on a misunderstanding of general relativity. According to the theory, light can travel through a black hole's event horizon, the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. However, this statement does not mean that light will be completely trapped inside the black hole. Instead, the black hole will act as afilter that will gradually reduce the intensity of the light rays as they pass through.\n\nQuestion (D) is incorrect because general relativity does not make any claims about the behavior of light near a black hole. The theory only describes the gravitational effects of massive objects on spacetime and the behavior of light within that context.",

The metallic material is typically metallic Nickel-alloy, but other materials such as Titanium, Zinc and Aluminum are also used. Shells are usually made from thin, curved sheets of metal that are welded together. The satellites are designed to maintain their shape and integrity even when subjected to the extreme forces of gravity created by their orbit. \n    \nIn general, satellites are designed to last for many years, regardless of the harsh environmental conditions they face. The metallic nature of the materials used in satellites makes them highly resistant to radiation, chemical attack and temperature changes. \n    \nThe spectral lines of the metals used in satellites are a critical factor in determining their design and performance. \n    \nIn orbit, the satellites are exposed to a wide range of electromagnetic radiations, including solar radiation, cosmic rays, and radio waves. The presence of spectral lines in the satellite's metallic materials can absorb or scatter these radiation particles, significantly affecting the satellite's overall performance and life cycle. \n    \nIn particular, the energy levels and quantum charges of the spectral lines can interact with the radiation particles and cause transformations, such as ionizing, dispersing or modifying the spectral lines themselves. \n    \nFor example, certain spectral lines of Nickel-alloy are known to be very susceptible to the absorption of high energy radiation, which could cause the satellite to puncture or deform. \n    \nOn the other hand, the presence of certain spectral lines can also help protect the satellite from harmful radiation. \n    \nFor example, the presence of Cobalt-alloy lines in the satellite's metallic materials can absorb much of the harmful energy from solar radiation, protecting the satellite from damage. \n    \nThe precise nature of the interaction between the radiation and the satellite's metallic materials is the subject of ongoing research and development in the field of space engineering. \n    \n\nThe final line of your answer should contain a single letter (A, B, C, or D) and a parenthesis without anything else.",
