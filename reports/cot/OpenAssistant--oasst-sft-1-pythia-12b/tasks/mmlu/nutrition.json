            "model_answer": "A. If the incidence rate of the disease falls, the prevalence of the disease in the population will increase, all else being constant. This is because the number of individuals who are affected by the disease will continue to rise, even though the overall population size might remain the same.\n\nB. If survival time with the disease increases, the prevalence of the disease in the population will increase, all else being constant. This is because individuals who survive the disease will be counted as affected, even if they do not develop symptoms.\n\nC. If recovery of the disease is faster, the prevalence of the disease in the population will increase, all else being constant. This is because individuals who recover will be counted as affected, even if they do not develop symptoms again.\n\nD. If the population in which the disease is measured increases, the prevalence of the disease in the population will increase, all else being constant. This is because the population size will continue to increase, leading to a greater number of individuals who are affected by the disease.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **A**.",

Processing such as chopping, cooking, and blending does not change their digestibility or bioavailabilty. They are used in the body to synthesize Vitamin A.\n\nItem C is false. \u00df-Carotene and lycopene are not considered provitamin A. Provitamin A is a group of carotenoids and vitamins that are converted in the body to vitamin A. Provitamin A is essential for vision, and is found in plant foods such as carrots and tomatoes. Processing such as chopping, cooking, and blending can destroy provitamin A. Only dietary vitamin A, found in animal products, can be converted into vitamin A.\n\nItem D is false. Carotenoids and flavonoids are not considered the same class of compounds. Carotenoids are a diverse group of compounds, including carotenes, lycopenes, and xanthones, while flavonoids are a larger group of compounds that includes flavones, flavans, and bibenzalones.

            "model_answer": "(A) Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor is a contributing factor to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults.\n\n\n intrinsic factor is a hormone produced by the stomach that helps ferry vitamin B12 from the small intestine to the liver. As we age, our stomachs can become less efficient at producing intrinsic factor, which can result in vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n\n Older adults are at increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency due to multiple factors, including reduced dietary intake, decreased calorie intake, declines in stomach acid production, and increased prevalence of gastrointestinal diseases such as gastritis. Additionally, some medications, including proton pump inhibitors, may also interfere with the production of intrinsic factor.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nThe risk of endometrial cancer increases with BMI, body fat percentage, and waist circumference. Among post-menopausal women, higher levels of estrone, estrone sulphate, and free estradiol are associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Obesity is associated with elevated levels of hormones related to weight gain, including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and lower levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG).\n\nTestosterone, oestrogen, and thyroid hormones are all hormones that affect the endometrium, but based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine which hormone is likely to be responsible for the increased risk of endometrial cancer in obese women. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the link between obesity and endometrial cancer, and to develop new strategies for reducing the risk of endometrial cancer in obese women.",

            "model_answer": "Calcium absorption in the small intestine is primarily a process of passive diffusion, facilitated by the presence of vitamin D and an Ion Exchange Column.\n\nVitamin D is required for the activation of Calcium Binding Protein which binds to Calcium andhelps to move it out of the intestinal cells and into the bloodstream.\n\nVitamin K is also involved in Calcium transport as it is necessary for the activity of Protein Kinase C which is involved in the phosphorylation of Calcium Sensitive Protein, leading to its release from the Ion Exchange Column and its entry into the bloodstream.\n\nTherefore, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, and Vitamin K are all required for Calcium absorption from the small intestine.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Let me first argue for answer (C). Protein turnover is the daily synthesis and degradation of proteins. The rate at which these processes occur is influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, body composition, and metabolism. However, the need for amino acids is generally regarded as an obligatory nutrient, meaning that the body requires them in large amounts regardless of the current state of the body. This is because protein synthesis requires the presence of amino acids, and the body cannot perform cellular processes without them. Additionally, the body is not able to store excess amino acids, and a shortage of amino acids can lead to declines in cellular function and development.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is likely that the metabolic demand for amino acids involves consumption of them by a number of irreversible pathways, such as those involved in protein synthesis. This implies that the body requires a large amount of amino acids, which must be supplied from the diet. Therefore, it is most accurate to conclude that the metabolic demand for amino acids involves consumption of them by a number of irreversible pathways and that these are either obligatory or adaptive.",

            "model_answer": "(D) The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children.\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nHuman amino acid requirements in human nutrition are the amounts of amino acids necessary to provide the body with the essential amino acids. Essential amino acids are those that the body cannot produce by itself and must ingest through food. The amino acid requirements for adults are determined based on scientific evidence and are considered to be the same for all ages. The requirements for maintenance, which are the amounts of amino acids the body needs to function properly, are also determined for adults. The amino acid patterns in breast milk and human tissue protein are based on scientific evidence and are assumed to be the same for all infants and young children.\n\nNote: The amino acid pattern of breast milk may be different from the pattern in human tissue protein, depending on the individual's diet and other factors.
