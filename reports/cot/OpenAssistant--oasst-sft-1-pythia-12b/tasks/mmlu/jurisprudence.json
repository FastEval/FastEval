            "model_answer": "(C) It explains the nature of power-conferring rules.\n\nThe idea behind the distinction between \"being obliged\" and \"having an obligation\" was that obligatory rules create a power relationship between the obligee and the obligor. In other words, although the obligor is not necessarily obliged to comply with the rule, if the obligor does not comply, the obligee has the ability to enforce the rule.\nIn this sense, \"being obliged\" refers to the intrinsic nature of the rule, while \"having an obligation\" refers to the ability to enforce the rule.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "I would say that the most compelling criticism of Llewellyn's distinction between the grand and formal styles of legal reasoning is D. While it is true that judges are often required to apply legal principles to specific facts in order to reach a decision, there is also a significant amount of interpretive work involved in any legal ruling. Judicial reasoning often involves a careful examination of the language and purpose of the law, as well as a consideration of the broader legal and social context. While there may be some instances where a judge may need to use a more formal style of reasoning, this does not necessarily mean that all judicial opinions must be written in a fancy, verbose manner. In fact, a focus on clarity and simplicity can often improve the readability and understanding of judicial opinions, even for those who are not law scholars. In conclusion, while the formal/grand style of legal reasoning may have some advantages, it is not the only way to approach legal reasoning and it should not be used as an excuse to write unnecessary or confusing legal opinions.",

If the POP fails to form a well-ordered society, it may not be consistent with Rawls' principle of equal access to distribute wealth and equality equally.",
