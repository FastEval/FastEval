When white light is incident on a solution of oil and water, the wavelength distribution of the reflected light is dependent on the refractive indices of the two media.\n\nIf white light is incident on a solution of water and oil, some of the radiation will be reflected at the interface between water and oil. The fraction of radiation that is reflected will be proportional to the difference in refractive indices between the two media.\n\nIf we assume that the refractive indices of both media are constant, then the fraction of reflected light will be proportional to the index of refraction of the oil layer. Because the index of refraction of oil is 1.5, the fraction of reflected light will be highest for a layer of oil with a refractive index of 1.5.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can predict that the most strongly reflected wavelength will be either 500 or 600 nm, depending on the exact refractive indices of the oil and water solution.",

            "model_answer": "The observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state can be understood in terms of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the position and the momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. This means that in a quantum system, the uncertainty in the position of a particle is proportional to its velocity, and the uncertainty in the momentum of a particle is proportional to its mass.\n\nIn the case of the helium atom, the para- state has the highest possible energy, while the ortho- state has the lowest possible energy. This can be seen from the fact that the energy levels of the atom are determined by the arrangement of the electrons, and the electrons in the para- state have a higher energy because they are arranged in a spatial configuration that minimizes the electron-electron repulsion. On the other hand, the electrons in the ortho- state are arranged in a more compact way, which requires them to spend more energy to move around, and hence have a lower energy.\n\nTherefore, the observation that the ortho- state has lower energy than the para- state can be seen as a result of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that the uncertainty in the position of a particle is proportional to its velocity, and the uncertainty in the momentum of a particle is proportional to its mass.",

This means that after a certain time T, the proton will have covered a distance d = vt = (0.6c)t. Now, we want to work out how much work has been done on the particle during this time.\n\nWork is calculated via the formula W = pdV, where W is the work done, pd is the pressure difference, V is the volume change and d is the distance changed.\n\nWork is calculated as W = mv^2, where m is the mass of the particle and v is its velocity.\n\nSetting W = dmv^2, we have:\n\nW = mv^2 = (0.6c)^2 * v^2\n\nNote that 0.6c is the initial speed of the proton, not its eventual speed. Also, because we are working with celsius temperatures, we need to use the squared velocity to take into account the speed being squared. Finally, we need to divide by the mass of the proton to get the work done.\n\nChoices (A), (C) and (D) all give the correct answer of 0.67mc^2.
