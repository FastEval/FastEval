Each bird is either to the left or right of the previous bird. If bird B1 is to the left of bird B2, then bird B2 is to the right of bird B1.\nParagraph 2 states that the robin is located fourth from the left. Since it is located fourth from the left, we can start counting to the right and add one to get the location of bird B4. Since bird B4 is to the right of bird B3, we can start counting to the left and add one to get the location of bird B5. Bird B5 is located fifth from the left.\nParagraph 3 states that the owl is located fourth from the left. Since it is located fourth from the left, we can start counting to the right and add one to get the location of bird B6. Since bird B6 is to the right of bird B4, we can start counting to the left and add one to get the location of bird B7. Bird B7 is located seventh from the left.\nParagraph 4 states that the quail is located third from the right. Since it is located third from the right, we can start counting to the right and add one to get the location of bird B8. Since bird B8 is to the right of bird B6, we can start counting to the left and add one to get the location of bird B9. Bird B9 is located fifth from the left.\nParagraph 5 states that the falcon is located left of the robin. Since it is located left of the robin, we can start counting to the right and add one to get the location of bird B10. Since bird B10 is to the right of bird B7, we can start counting to the left and add one to get the location of bird B11. Bird B11 is located second from the left.\nParagraph 6 states that the hummingbird is located fourth from the left. Since it is located fourth from the left, we can start counting to the right and add one to get the location of bird B12. Since bird B12 is to the right of bird B11, we can start counting to the left and add one to get the location of bird B13. Bird B13 is located third from the left.\nParagraph 7 states that the cardinal is located fourth from the right. Since it is located fourth from the right, we can start counting to the right and add one to get the location of bird B14. Since bird B14 is to the right of bird B12, we can start counting to the left and add one to get the location of bird B15. Bird B15 is located fifth from the left.\n\nTo summarize, bird B15 is the answer because bird B15 is the fourth from the left and bird B12 is to the right of bird B11, who is second from the left, meaning that bird B12 is the third from the right.",
