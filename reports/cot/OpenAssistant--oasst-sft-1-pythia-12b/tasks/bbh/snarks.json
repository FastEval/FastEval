While light rail may be a more comprehensive and efficient form of public transportation, it is not a viable alternative to the trams that are currently serving the city.

The statement is designed to be insulting or provocative, and it suggests that the speaker is not interested in fighting on the enemy's terms, but rather in his own objectives.\n\nThe final line of the statement, \"the answer is [A],\" plays on the ambiguity of the original question and suggests that the answer is not exactly what it appears to be.
