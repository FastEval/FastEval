To solve this problem, we can use the 2008 Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nSo, let's start by calculating the lengths of the three sides of the triangle:\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse is determined by the formula:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nHere, c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nc^2 = 10^2 + 8^2\nc^2 = 100 + 64\nc^2 = 162\nc = 6\n\nThe length of the left side (the side opposite the right angle) is determined by the formula:\n\na^2 = c^2 - b^2\n\na^2 = 162 - 64 = 134\na = 13\n\nThe length of the right side (the side closer to the right angle) is determined by the formula:\n\nb^2 = c^2 - a^2\n\nb^2 = 162 - 134 = 28\nb = 2\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the possible times that Emily could have gone to the soccer field:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\nc^2 = 162 + 2^2\nc^2 = 184\nc = 10\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n2^2 = (10 + 2)^2\n2^4 - 10^2 = 16^2 - 100\n2^6 - 16^4 + 100^2 = 16^6 - 16^2 + 100^2\n16^6 - 100^2 = 15400\n15400 - 100^2 = 14400\n14400 = 12800",

This is likely 7pm because that is when she arrives at the Leaning Tower of Pisa and has time to take photos before it closes at 9pm.\n\nNow, to determine the actual time that Ashley went to the bookstore, we have to subtract the earliest time that anyone could have seen her buying a bike at the bike shop (11am) from the latest time that anyone could have seen her working out at the gym (4pm).
