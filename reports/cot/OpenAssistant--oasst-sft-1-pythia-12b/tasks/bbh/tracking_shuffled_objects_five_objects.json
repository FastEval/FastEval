We can do this by coloring the cells of the table based on the friend's status. Let's say we want to figure out who has read each of the books. We can do that by looking at the cells that correspond to the friend's read status. For example, since Eve has read Catch-22, we will color her cell blue. Similarly, we can circle the friends who have not read each book. In this case, Bob has not read Hound of the Baskervilles, and we circle him.

Explain the rules of the exchange: Each friend will have one book they acquire for themselves, and another book they give to the other friend as a trade. They will only trade books that they have read and like. Additionally, they will keep their original books and never trade them back.\n\n2. Assign books to each friend: Based on the rules above, each friend will be assigned one book to keep, and another book to trade. I will assign the books in order from highest to lowest score on a scale from 1 to 5:\n1. The Great Gatsby\n2. Moby Dick\n3. Frankenstein\n4. Catch-22\n5. The Fellowship of the Ring\n\n3. Compute the final score for each friend: Each friend will Total their score for each book they received and give the same score to their book they keep. Their final score will be the average of their scores (rounded to the nearest integer) for their traded books.\n\n4. Choose the best book for each friend: Based on their final scores, I will choose one book as the best book for each friend. This will be the book they keep.\n\nSo, the final answer will be \"E\" for Eve. She enjoyed Catch-22 the most and gave it to Dave as a trade, so she got the better book in the exchange.",
