This can be attributed to the fact that the peaches are less mature and therefore have a lower price per pound.\n* The mangoes are the least expensive fruits, and they are also the cheapest per pound.

In the second statement, \"The orange book is the second from the left.\", the statement means that the orange book is on the left side of the yellow book.\n\nTherefore, the statements are logically consistent. However, they are not necessarily true or false depending on the specific arrangement of the books on the shelf.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationships between the statements.\n\nThe statements do not contain any relationship between themselves, so we need to analyze the relationships between them.\n\n- The statements are concerned with the relative positions of the books on the shelf.\n\n- The statements are not concerned with the specific identities or locations of the books.\n\n- Therefore, the statements do not make any claims about the identities or locations of the books.\n\n- Therefore, the statements are not interconnected in any way.\n\nStep 3: Choose a hypothesis and determine whether it is supported or contradicted by the statements.\n\nThe most straightforward hypothesis is that the statements are either all true or all false. Under this hypothesis, the statement \"The blue book is to the right of the yellow book.\" would be supported, and the statement \"The orange book is the second from the left.\" would be contradicted.\n\nHowever, this hypothesis is not necessarily true or false, as the statements are not related to one another. Therefore, we need to consider other possiblehypotheses.\n\nOne possible hypothesis is that the statements are either both true or both false. Under this hypothesis, the statement \"The orange book is the second from the left.\" would be supported and the statement \"The yellow book is the second from the left.\" would be contradicted.\n\nAnother possible hypothesis is that the statements are not all true or all false. Under this hypothesis, the statements could be partiallytrue or partially false, with some statements being true and some statements being false. Under this hypothesis, the statement \"The blue book is to the right of the yellow book.\" would be supported, and the statement \"The orange book is the second from the left.\" would be contradicted.\n\nAfter considering these three possiblehypotheses and analyzing their relationships with the statements, we can choose the most likelyhypothesis and determine whether it is supported or contradicted by the statements.\n\nIn this case, the most likely hypothesis is that the statements are not all true or all false. Under this hypothesis, the statements could be partiallytrue or partially false, with some statements being true and some statements being false.
