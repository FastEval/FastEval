At the start of a song, they each have a partner: Alice is dancing with Helga, Bob is dancing with Patrick, and Claire is dancing with Sam.\nThroughout the song, the dancers often trade partners. First, Claire and Alice switch partners. Then, Claire and Bob switch partners. Finally, Alice and Bob switch partners. At the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with\nOptions:\n(A) Helga\n(B) Patrick\n(C) Sam",
            "correct_answer": "(A)",
            "model_answer": "(A) Helga\nUnder the assumption that the partners switch only once per song, the dancers can be processed in the following way:\n1. Alice and Helga start the dance.\n2. Bob and Patrick start the dance.\n3. Bob and Patrick switch partners.\n4. Alice and Patrick switch partners.\n5. Alice and Helga start the dance.\n6. Bob and Patrick switch partners.\n7. Bob and Sam start the dance.\n8. Alice and Sam start the dance.\nSince Bob and Patrick switch partners twice, it can be deduced that Patrick is Bob's partner after the first switch and Helga is Bob's partner after the second switch. Similar reasoning can be used for the other two partnerships. That gives us the following possible pairings for the four dancers: \nBob-Helga\nPatrick-Helga\nAlice-Patrick\nBob-Sam\nAlice-Sam",

This book is known for its sprawling nature and complex characters, and would be a suitable choice for a sophisticated reader.\n\nBased on the choices provided, we can eliminate (C) Ulysses as a possible answer because it is a very different type of book than the other two books.
