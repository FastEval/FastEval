Check which other items are still present:\n- The only other items that are not a keychain or a puzzle are the three brown crayons.\nTherefore, we can conclude that all the keychains have been removed, but the three brown crayons are still present on the nightstand.\n\n3. Calculate the number of silver items:\n- There are three brown crayons and potentially 12 silver items in total.\n- However, because we have removed all the keychains the possible items on the nightstand are reduced to just the silver crayons and the puzzles.\n- So, the final answer is 3 (the number of crayons).",
