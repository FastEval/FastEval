            "model_answer": "The following is a step-by-step explanation of how to calculate the date tomorrow (tomorrow's date in MM/DD/YYYY format) given today's date (December 25, 1937) in a parsimonious way, without using any outside information or calculators:\n\nStep 1: Convert December 25, 1937 to a military time date:\nDecember 25, 1937 is a Saturday, which is the last day of the month December. Military time is a system of timekeeping that commonly used in certain regions, where weekend days are treated as full days instead of half days. To convert December 25, 1937 to a military time date, we need to determine the number of full days between December 25, 1937 and Saturday, January 2, 1938, which is the first Sunday following the 25th.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of full days between December 25, 1937 and January 2, 1938:\nUsing the formula `DateDiff(Date, EndDate, [Number of days])`, we can calculate the number of full days between December 25, 1937 and January 2, 1938:\n\n```\nDateDiff(Date, EndDate, [Number of days]) = DateDiff(Date, StartDate, [Number of days]) + [Number of days]\n```\n\nwhere `StartDate` is December 25, 1937, and `EndDate` is January 2, 1938.\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of weekend days between December 25, 1937 and January 2, 1938:\nThere are 52 weekend days in a year, so we can multiply the number of full days between December 25, 1937 and January 2, 1938 (Step 2) by 52 to get the number of weekend days.\n\nStep 4: Convert the number of weekend days to a date format:\nWe can convert the number of weekend days to a date format by selecting a date format that agrees with the number of weekend days. For example, if we want to display the date as \"Saturday, January 2, 1938\", we would select the `Date()` function with a format code of `d` (for a Saturday) and `/17/1930` as the date argument (the number of weekend days).\n\nStep 5: Select the date where tomorrow's date occurs:\nTo select the date where tomorrow's date (tomorrow's date in MM/DD/YYYY format) occurs, we can use the `DateAdd()` function with a `Date()` function and the number of days that separate today's date (December 25, 1937) from tomorrow's date. The formula for tomorrow's date is:\n\n```\ntomorrow = Today + NumberOfDays('tomorrow', 'yyyy-MM-dd')\n```\n\nwhere `NumberOfDays()` is a function that returns the number of days that have passed since a specified date, and `yyyy-MM-dd` is the date format for tomorrow's date.\n\nStep 6: Output the answer:\nFinally, we can output the answer by selecting the `Output()` function with the desired date format and returning the result. For example, if we want to output tomorrow's date as a single letter with parenthesis, we would use the following formula:\n\n```\nAnswer = DateAdd(Date(), NumberOfDays('tomorrow', 'yyyy-MM-dd'), 'd')\n```\n\nwhere `Answer` is the tomorrow's date in the desired format.\n\nThis method provides a concise and efficient way to calculate tomorrow's date in MM/DD/YYYY format given today's date, without using any outside information or calculators. However, this method assumes that the user selects a specific date format for tomorrow's date and that the number of weekend days will remain the same on January 2, 1938 compared to today's date.",
