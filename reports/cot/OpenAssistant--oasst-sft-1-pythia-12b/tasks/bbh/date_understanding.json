We can calculate the date one year ago from today using the formula (Today's Date) - 1. We will calculate this for each day in the current month and then find the day with the fewest decimal places. But before we start, it is important to note that for February 29th, we need to add 1 to January 1st, since 29th is a Leap Day and not a regular day.\n\n2. February 29th has a day of the week of 0 and a day of the week of 6, so we will start with February 26th: (Today's Date) - 1 + 1 = 26th\n\n3. February 26th is a Wednesday, so there is a possible date of February 23rd that falls on a Wednesday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 2 = 23rd\n\n4. February 23rd is a Monday, so there is a possible date of February 20th that falls on a Monday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 20th\n\n5. February 20th is a Sunday, so there is a possible date of February 18th that falls on a Sunday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 18th\n\n6. February 18th is a Saturday, so there is a possible date of February 16th that falls on a Saturday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 16th\n\n7. February 16th is a Friday, so there is a possible date of February 14th that falls on a Friday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 14th\n\n8. February 14th is a Thursday, so there is a possible date of February 13th that falls on a Thursday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13th\n\n9. February 13th is a Wednesday, so there is a possible date of February 12th that falls on a Wednesday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 7 = 12th\n\n10. February 12th is a Tuesday, so there is a possible date of February 11th that falls on a Tuesday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 8 = 11th\n\n11. February 11th is a Monday, so there is a possible date of February 10th that falls on a Monday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 9 = 10th\n\n12. February 10th is a Sunday, so there is a possible date of February 9th that falls on a Sunday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 10 = 9th\n\n13. February 9th is a Saturday, so there is a possible date of February 8th that falls on a Saturday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 11 = 8th\n\n14. February 8th is a Friday, so there is a possible date of February 7th that falls on a Friday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 12 = 7th\n\n15. February 7th is a Thursday, so there is a possible date of February 6th that falls on a Thursday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 13 = 6th\n\n16. February 6th is a Wednesday, so there is a possible date of February 5th that falls on a Wednesday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 14 = 5th\n\n17. February 5th is a Tuesday, so there is a possible date of February 4th that falls on a Tuesday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 15 = 4th\n\n18. February 4th is a Monday, so there is a possible date of February 3rd that falls on a Monday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 16 = 3rd\n\n19. February 3rd is a Sunday, so there is a possible date of February 2nd that falls on a Sunday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 17 = 2nd\n\n20. February 2nd is a Saturday, so there is a possible date of February 1st that falls on a Saturday: (Today's Date) - 1 + 2 + 3 + 18 = 1st\n\nNow that we have found all possible dates for February 8th in the current year, we can look at the first date that falls on a day other than a Wednesday, Thursday, or Saturday: Wednesday, February 5th. Thursday, February 6th. Or Saturday, February 8th. Because all previous dates had a day of the week that was one higher than the day of the week for February 8th, February 5th, February 6th, or February 8th, respectively, they are not valid dates.

To do this, we need to determine the day of the week that week one week ago was. For this, we can use the day of the week function, which returns an integer value ranging from 0 to 6 representing the day of the week.\n\n    week ago = datetime.datetime.now().week - 1\n    day_of_week = datetime.datetime.now().dayofweek\n\nNext, we need to calculate the difference between the current date and the date one week ago. This can be done using the subtracting operators in Python.\n\n    one_week_ago = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=7)\n\nNow that we have the dates, we can calculate the difference between them to get the number of days that have passed since one week ago.\n\n    days_passed = one_week_ago.days\n\nFinally, we can convert the number of days that have passed since one week ago to a single letter using the string formatting functions in Python.\n\n    result = 'A' if days_passed < 7 else ('B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F')[days_passed - 7]\n\nWe now have the desired result, \"A\", for an answer of one week ago that was in the month of June, the day of the week of Monday, and the year of 2021.

October 2009 is the 10th and 16th of the month, which gives us two days in the month. November 2009 is the 11th and 23rd, which also gives us two days. Finally, December 2009 is the 12th and 30th, which also gives us two days.\n\nSo, starting from the October of 2009 and moving forward, each month will have exactly four days. We can then count the number of visits Jane has made to the bookstore during each month. We'll start from October 2009 and add one to the number of visits each time we find a day that matches the ones in our month list.\n\nFor October 2009, there are five days in the month: October 1, October 2, October 3, October 4, and October 5. So we have five visits to the bookstore during that month.\n\nFor November 2009, there are nine days in the month: November 1, November 2, November 3, November 4, November 5, November 6, November 7, November 8, and November 9. So we have nine visits to the bookstore during that month.\n\nFor December 2009, there are 16 days in the month: December 1, December 2, December 3, December 4, December 5, December 6, December 7, December 8, December 9, December 10, December 11, December 12, December 13, December 14, December 15, and December 16. So we have 16 visits to the bookstore during that month.\n\nHowever, the visits aren't always on the same day each time. For example, November 1st may correspond to a visit on November 3rd, while November 3rd may correspond to a visit on November 4th. So we need to account for that.\n\nWhen we add up the number of visits for each month, we get the following:\n\nOctober 2009: 5 + 1 = 6\nNovember 2009: 9 + 1 = 10\nDecember 2009: 16 + 1 = 17\n\nTherefore, the date today in MM/DD/YYYY is November 23rd, 2009.
