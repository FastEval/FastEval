The character's name is a humorous take on the concept of a 'third man' - someone who is not involved in the main events of a story, but who has important knowledge or influence.

In the film, the characters are led on a dangerous journey through different cultures and civilizations, encountering numerous obstacles and enemies along the way.\n\nIn the humorous edit, \"raiders of the lost ark\" is an attempt to parody the film's memorable name and the obstacles the characters must overcome.
