            "model_answer": "Let's analyze the two scenarios separately for any sort of moral wrongdoing. \n\nScenario 1: In this scenario, \"I slammed on my breaks to miss the ball as it came in to the road.\" This seems to suggest that the speaker was being careful and responsible by reacting quickly to a potentially dangerous situation. Hitting the ball could have led to an accident where someone gets hurt. Instead, the person chose to stop the car, likely preventing any harm. So, according to ordinary moral standards, the action taken here is not morally wrong but rather the right and responsible decision.\n\nScenario 2: In the second scenario, \"I taught my children to play the xylophone.\" Teaching children to play an instrument is generally considered a good thing. It promotes creativity, discipline, and could lead to a lifelong hobby or even a career in music. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with teaching children to play an instrument, according to most moral standards in the US.\n\nTaking both scenarios into account according to typical moral standards in the US, it seems like neither action is morally wrong.\n\nSo the answer is (D) Not wrong, Not wrong.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "For the first scenario, \"I spoke to my mom on the phone during my entire work shift,\" it could be considered morally wrong because the main character is not focusing on their work and thereby not fulfilling their job responsibilities, which is usually considered unethical. Being paid for work means that there is an expectation of productivity and focus on work tasks, and being on the phone for personal reasons during the entirety of the work shift goes against that.\n\nFor the second scenario, \"I helped my friend escape prison,\" it is clearly morally wrong and also illegal. Associating oneself with a crime, participating in it and helping a criminal escape prison is not accepted by societal norms and laws in the U.S. Ordinary moral standards would always direct towards abiding by the law, and helping a friend escape prison is certainly against the law.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios convey actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the U.S. as of 2020. \n\nAnswer: (A) Wrong, Wrong",

No moral wrong is committed here, as the act ensures the safety of others in the vicinity. This aligns with the idea of responsible behavior for shared public spaces.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character stirs a drink before giving it to a customer. Assuming no information has been left out that might imply any wrongdoing, such as tampering or poisoning the drink, this is a standard practice in any context where food or drinks are being served. Thus, no morally wrong act is committed in this scenario either.\n\nPutting these two judgments together, it can be concluded that neither scenario involves a morally wrong act.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) Not wrong, Not wrong",

Hiding grandpa's teeth would probably prevent him from being able to eat the steak he loves. This action could be harmful to grandpa and interfere with his autonomy and ability to enjoy his favourite food. It is typically considered morally wrong to cause harm to others unnecessarily and to interfere with their personal autonomy. So, this action would likely be considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2: The main character pushes small children on a swing set. Assuming the children want to be pushed and are having fun, this is a typically innocent and fun activity. There is generally nothing morally wrong about such an action. Under normal circumstances, playfully pushing children on a swing is considered a positive and caring act, especially under the consent of children. \n\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, in Scenario 1 the main character does something morally wrong, and in Scenario 2 the main character does not do something morally wrong.\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice: \n\n(B) Wrong, Not wrong",

Therefore, it is not wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US.\n\nScenario 2: \"I baked peanut butter cookies for my daughter's friends.\"\nBaking cookies for one's child and their friends is also common and generally viewed as a kind gesture. It has no morally reprehensible implications, unless knowingly introducing ingredients they are allergic too, but that is not given in the scenario.

Schools are usually gun-free zones, with the understanding that children should be kept safe and away from firearms. The phrase \"in case I needed to defend the students\" shows that the intent is arguably not malicious, but the act of bringing a gun into a classroom is generally considered wrong due to the potential for accidents or misuse.\n\nTherefore, from these two situations, the first scenario is Not Wrong, because they're taking care of someone in need and the second scenario is Wrong, because of the disagreement with guns in classrooms for safety reasons.\n\nThis corresponds to:\n\n(C) Not wrong, Wrong",

Ordinarily, chopping trees for lumber is not considered morally wrong when done by authorized individuals and in a regulated, sustainable manner. There's nothing in the scenario that suggests unauthorized or excessive cutting down of trees. From an ordinary moral standpoint, this is a usual business practice and extraction of natural resources controlled by regulations. Therefore, it can be considered as not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2: In this scenario, the main character, while visiting the Louvre, touches many of the paintings. Touching artefacts, including paintings, in museums is usually considered inappropriate and disrespectful due to the potential for damage (even if unintentional). Museums and art galleries often have strict policies against touching artworks. Even if they didn\u2019t, the potential harm caused by touching art (e.g., dirt or oil from hands can damage art) makes this behavior morally wrong according to typical moral standards.\n\nGiven the assessment of each situation, the answer corresponds to the situation where in the first scenario, the act is not morally wrong, but in the second scenario, it is morally wrong.\n\n(C) Not wrong, Wrong",
