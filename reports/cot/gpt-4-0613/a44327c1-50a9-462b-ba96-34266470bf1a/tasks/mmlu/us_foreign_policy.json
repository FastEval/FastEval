            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The United Nations Security Council is an important body of the United Nations that is responsible for maintaining international peace and security. Its structure is unique and is comprised of both permanent and non-permanent members.\n\nThere are five permanent members in the United Nations Security Council. These five countries are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These five countries were the victorious powers in World War II and have remained as permanent members since the formation of the United Nations.\n\nIn addition to these five permanent members, the Security Council also includes ten non-permanent members. These members are elected by the United Nations General Assembly for a term of two years.\n\nThe key difference between the permanent and non-permanent members is that the permanent members have veto power. This means that they can block any substantive resolution from being passed by the Security Council. This veto power is not extended to the non-permanent members.\n\nTherefore, the structure of the United Nations Security Council is:\n\n(A) 5 permanent members with veto power, 10 rotating members with no veto power.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The Gulf of Tonkin resolution was an important event during the Vietnam War. After alleged attacks on U.S. naval ships by North Vietnamese forces in the Gulf of Tonkin, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson sought and received approval from Congress for the resolution.\n\nThe resolution gave the President the authority to \"take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression.\" In essence, it gave the president broad powers to wage war without a formal declaration of war by Congress.\n\nThis resolution did not have much to do with public opinion on US foreign policy; rather, it was a governmental response to perceived aggression by North Vietnam. Therefore, option B is unlikely.\n\nThe Gulf of Tonkin resolution did not enhance Congressional control over the Vietnam War. Instead, it gave the executive branch, specifically the president, more authority to conduct the war, as already explained. Therefore, option C is not correct.\n\nSimilarly, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution did not curtail U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Quite the opposite, it escalated U.S. involvement in the war. Thus, option D cannot be correct.\n\nConsidering the respective roles of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, we can conclude that the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution's primary significance was that it empowered the U.S. to amplify its commitment in Vietnam. Thus option A appears to be correct.\n\n(A) It allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what a nonstate actor is. Nonstate actor refers to groups or organizations that have significant political influence but are not affiliated with any established institution of a nation. This means they operate outside the formal state system and can potentially be involved in a range of activities that pose a threat to a country\u2019s security such as terrorism, organized crime, and drug trafficking.\n\n(A) Terrorists fall into this category as they are extremists who use violence for political purposes and are not part of any official state institution.\n\n(B) Organized crime is another nonstate actor, as this refers to structured groups that carry out illegal activities. They function outside the state's infrastructure.\n\n(C) Drug traffickers also qualify as nonstate actors. These are groups or individuals involved in the distribution of illegal substances and are not associated with any nation's formal institutions.\n\n(D) China, however, is a state actor as it is an established nation with its own government institutions. Hence would not be considered a nonstate actor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is China. \n\n(D) China",

            "model_answer": "First, let's look at the timeline. Prior to the 1970s, US-China relations were virtually non-existent due to the Korean War and the US's refusal to recognize the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the legitimate government of China.\n\nThe breakdown of the Sino-Soviet alliance in the 1960s signaled an opportunity for the US to influence a shift in the balance of power during the Cold War. Richard Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, spearheaded the move towards a rapprochement with China.\n\nThe legendary trip of President Richard Nixon to China took place February 21\u201328, 1972. This historic visit marked the first time a U.S. President had visited the PRC, who at that time considered the U.S. one of its staunchest foes.\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan all served as president after Nixon. Although they visited China during their terms as president, they were not the first to do so. \n\nAs a result, the answer must be (A) Richard Nixon.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, also known as START, was a bilateral treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on the reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms. The treaty was signed on 31 July 1991 and entered into force on 5 December 1994. Therefore, the options B and C can be eliminated, as the treaty was not about cutting conventional arms in Europe and it was not rejected by the U.S. Senate.\n\nBetween options A and D, both could technically be correct, though the treaty's primary objective was to reduce and limit strategic arms specifically. The treaty did indeed mandate the elimination of many long-range nuclear missiles, which are a part of strategic offensive arms. However, its main distinguishing feature is the fact that it was the first major arms control agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union that not only limited the number of offensive arms, but also significantly reduced them.\n\nSo while D is partly correct, A fully captures the essence of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. \n\nThe final answer is (A) on nuclear weapons signed between the United States and the Soviet Union.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The term \"American exceptionalism\" refers broadly to the belief that the United States is fundamentally different from other nations\u2014usually due to its unique history, political institutions, or values. \n\nDuring the Cold War, the United States positioned itself as a global leader, specifically as the champion of democracy and capitalism against the repressive ideologies of Communism spearheaded by the Soviet Union. This amplified the notion of American exceptionalism.\n\nOption (B) that states \"Exceptionalism was enhanced by America's status as the 'leader of the free world'\" is therefore a plausible implication of the Cold War for American exceptionalism. The Cold War's global dynamics corroborated America's sense of itself as an exceptional nation, distinct in its political, economic and moral leadership.\n\nAt the same time, the extension of American influence and power across the globe often involved interventionist policies and actions that challenged core assumptions of American exceptionalism, such as the belief in self-determination and a hands-off approach to international affairs.\n\nIn other words, while the US was propagating its exceptionalism, it was also acting in ways that contradicted some of the principles associated with it. Therefore, option (C) \"The extension of American power globally challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism\" is also a plausible implication.\n\nSeeing that both options (B) & (C) have feasible implications of the Cold war on American exceptionally, the answer should be (D) Both b and c. \n\n(D) Both b and c",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Franklin D. Roosevelt initially favored an isolationist stance because he believed in taking care of domestic issues first, particularly the economic problems plaguing the US during the Great Depression era. This is to say, he wanted to focus more on internal reforms to improve the economy of the US. This concept was embodied in his New Deal policies, which aimed at addressing the economic crisis in the country, rather than engaging in international political conflicts.\n\nOption B cannot be correct. Roosevelt certainly did not believe that German domination of Europe would be in the best interests of the U.S. Indeed, he later led the U.S. into World War II against Germany.\n\nOption C is also incorrect. Roosevelt was not always an isolationist. As mentioned, his initial stance was more isolationist due to the imperative of domestic economic reform. But as World War II continued in Europe and the threats to international peace and security escalated, he recognized the necessity of the U.S. involvement, leading the country into the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nSo the correct answer, based on above explanation, is:\n\n(A) He believed that internal reform rather than international negotiation was the key to economic regeneration of the US.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The 'New Populism' is a term that often relates to political movements which aim to represent the interests and perspectives of ordinary people. This usually means a emphasis on public opinion and the needs of the everyday person. This is often acclaimed by increased dialogue with the public and as such, is often seen in forms of democratic decision-making or platforms that attempt to bridge the gap between the public and the government. \n\nSo, from the options provided, the 'New Populism' is most likely reflected in the \"Increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making\". This is because populism as a political idea or movement often values of public opinion and desires, and it attempts to apply them in policy making. Hence, it is a tendency of populist movements to increase the incorporation of public opinion into policy-making processes. This can happen in various fields, including foreign policy making.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) Increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The impact of World War I on the shift of economic power from Europe to the United States can be explained as follows:\n\n(A) Although the war led to a decline in the population of Europe, the reduction in population levels did not directly translate to economic power shift.\n\n(B) While some resources of Germany and its allies were seized after the war, not all of these resources ended up in the United States. Thus, the United States did not gain much economic power through this method. \n\n(C) European countries did pay the US for assistance, mainly in the form of loans and purchase of war supplies, which contributed to economic growth in the US. However, it was the repayment of these loans after the war ended that substantially shifted economic power to the US.\n\n(D) The United States indeed gave loans to European countries and sold them war supplies during World War I, making the country a leading international creditor. The massive spending of European countries resulted in robust growth in the United States. Consequently, the United States was recognized as a new financial center. This point particularly highlights the shift of economic power from Europe to America following World War I.\n\nConsidering the given choices, the most influential factor in the shift of economic power was the United States becoming a creditor nation and a global financial center due to Europe's war spending which boosted the US economy. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The process of declaring war in the American government is defined by the U.S. Constitution. In this founding document, it is clearly stated that the power to declare war rests with Congress, not the president, nor the secretary of defense, nor the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \n\nEven though the president is the commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces, this does not grant him or her the authority to declare war. That power is exclusively given to Congress, as stated in Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the U.S. Constitution. This clause, also known as the War Powers Clause, specifically provides that the Congress has the power \"To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land and water.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the powers of the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are primarily advisory and administrative. They have a role in the execution of decisions made by the president in his/her capacity as commander-in-chief, but they do not have the power to decide when the country goes to war. \n\nThe process of war declaration typically involves significant debate and deliberation in both the Senate and House of Representatives. If a majority of both houses vote in favor of war, then a declaration of war is issued. The president then has the responsibility to manage and conduct the war that Congress has declared.\n\nTherefore, the power to declare war rests with (D) Congress.",
