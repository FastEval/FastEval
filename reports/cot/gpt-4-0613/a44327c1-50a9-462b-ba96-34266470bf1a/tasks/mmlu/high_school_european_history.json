            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Firstly, Huxley defines \"Protoplasm\", translated as \"the physical basis of life\". He seems to explore the idea of there being a physical or material aspect to life, which could be a novel concept to many. This indicates that his interpretation of \"life\" is not divorced from the realm of tangibility or matter.\n\nAdditionally, he mentions the widespread conception of life as something that \"works through matter\", suggesting that there's a common understanding of life being interconnected with matter, in a way that it either manipulates it or utilizes it. \n\nFinally, he describes the \"matter of life\" as breaking up into certain compounds which only possess properties of \"ordinary matter\". This suggests he believes life is not a special or supernatural phenomenon, but is instead closely tied with and perhaps dependent upon standard physical matter.\n\nCombining these points, it appears that Huxley argued \"life\" was not a supernatural or solely philosophical concept, nor merely a force that works through matter. Rather, he presents life as being inextricably linked with or derived from a specific type of matter.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate inference from the passage is that Huxley argued that \"life\" was:\n\n(C) merely a property of a certain kind of matter",

He rather seems to be questioning and criticizing the underlying principles of religious intolerance, such as the Inquisition, which suggests some level of reform rather than complete rejection of religion. This eliminates option C.\n\n(D) This leaves us with option D. In the passage, Voltaire suggests that a rational, objective, and, particularly, more tolerant approach to the social issue of religious intolerance is needed.

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him.
