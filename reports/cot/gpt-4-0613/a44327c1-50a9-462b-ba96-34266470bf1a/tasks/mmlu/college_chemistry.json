Some molecular bonds do not show absorption in the infrared region due to symmetry or low polarity. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n(B) The intensity of an IR peak has nothing to do with the molecular mass. The intensity of an IR peak depends on the change in dipole moment during vibration and also the number of molecules that are in the same vibrational state. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n(C) The absorption of infra-red radiation by a molecule is specific to certain types of bonds, and thus, different functional groups with their own specific set of bonds will absorb IR radiation at different frequencies within the spectrum. This range of frequencies for a given functional group is usually consistent, and produces a characteristic peak in an IR spectrum. Hence, functional groups can be identified by their IR spectra. This ticks logical statement.\n\n(D) While it's true that different elements absorb radiation at different frequencies, IR spectroscopy is more concerned with bond vibrations within a molecule, not the individual elements. So, this option is incorrect. \n\nSo the correct answer is (C). Most organic functional groups absorb in a characteristic region of the IR spectrum.",

Enthalpy (H) is a measure of total energy in a thermodynamic system. It is the sum of the internal energy (U) added to the product of pressure (P) and volume (V).

These are properties of materials that relate to the behavior of their electrons in the presence of a magnetic field, and not to their chemical reactions with oxygen or other oxidants.\n\n(B) Low-spin electron configuration: This can vary depending on the particular paramagnetic or ferromagnetic material. In some cases, a low-spin configuration might be present, but this is not a universal requirement for all such materials.\n\n(C) Metallic physical properties: Not all materials that show paramagnetism or ferromagnetism are necessarily metals. Both properties are rather a matter of the electron configuration, particularly the presence of unpaired electrons. \n\n(D) Unpaired electrons: This is a key factor in both paramagnetism and ferromagnetism. Materials can't be paramagnetic or ferromagnetic if their electrons are all paired up, because the magnetic moments of the electron pairs cancel each other out.

A 1H NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance) spectrum shows the relative amounts of different types of hydrogen atoms in a molecule. The relative intensities of the lines in the 1H NMR spectrum are proportional to the relative amounts of the hydrogen types in the mixture.\n\nDimethylsulphoxide, often abbreviated as DMSO, has 6 equivalent protons. This means that when it contributes to the NMR spectrum, all of these protons contribute to the same signal (because they are in the same chemical environment).\n\nAcetonitrile, or AN, has 3 protons. Similar to DMSO, they are equivalent and would contribute to the same signal in the NMR spectrum.\n\nGiven that the relative intensity of the DMSO signal is \u03b1 and that of AN signal is 3\u03b1, we can conclude that the ratio of DMSO protons to AN protons in the mixture is \u03b1/3\u03b1 = 1/3.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the ratio of the concentration of DMSO and AN, not the ratio of the number of protons. Therefore, we need to adjust this ratio to account for the different number of protons in each molecule.\n\nSince DMSO has twice the number of protons as AN (6 vs 3), we multiply the calculated ratio by 2 to get the ratio of the concentrations, which gives 1/3 * 2 = 2/3.\n\nThus, the ratio of the concentrations of DMSO to AN in the mixture is 2:3.\n\nThe answer is (D) 2:3.",

It is primarily affected by interactions between neighboring nuclear spins.\n\nMolecular motions can influence both T1 and T2 relaxation times. However, molecular motions at very low frequencies, also known as slow molecular motions, primarily influence T1 relaxation rates, as the energy is transferred from the nucleus to the surrounding lattice more effectively.\n\nOn the other hand, molecular motions at frequencies near the Larmor frequency tend to influence T2 relaxation rates more. This scenario is referred to as rapid molecular motions, where energy is interchanged among the spins themselves leading to dephasing and thus affecting T2 more.\n\nTherefore, T1 could be longer than T2 because it is more sensitive to slow or very low-frequency molecular motions.
