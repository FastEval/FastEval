Therefore, the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is nothing more than Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n\nStep 2: Notice that sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both not in the base field Q, and sqrt(2) is not a multiple of sqrt(3), nor is the converse true. Therefore, Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is a 2-dimensional vector space over Q(sqrt(2)) and also a 2-dimensional vector space over Q(sqrt(3)).\n\nStep 3: Recall that for any field extensions K \u2286 F \u2286 E, we have that [E:K] = [E:F][F:K]. Consider K = Q, F = Q(sqrt(2)), and E = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).

            "model_answer": "The problem asks for the index of <p> in S_5. The term \"index\" in this context refers to a measure of the size or length of a group or set in relation to another. By definition, if H is a subgroup of G, then the index of H in G is the number of left or right cosets of H in G. This is equivalent to the order of the group G divided by the order of the subgroup H.\n\nIn this case, G is the symmetric group S_5 and H is the group generated by the permutation p, denoted <p>. \n\nThe symmetric group S_n is the group of all possible permutations of n elements, so its order (or number of elements) is n! (n factorial, or the product of all positive integers up to n). In this case, since S_5 is the symmetric group of 5 elements, its order is 5!=120.\n\nNow let's find the order of the group generated by the permutation p. The order of a group generated by an element is the smallest positive integer n such that p^n=e where e is the identity. In other words, it's the minimum number of times you must apply the permutation to return to the starting configuration.\n\nThe permutation p is given as a product of two disjoint cycles, (1,2,5,4) and (2,3). The order of a product of disjoint cycles is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the cycles.\n\nIn this case, the lengths of the cycles are 4 (for (1,2,5,4)) and 2 (for (2,3)). The LCM of 4 and 2 is 4.\n\nHence the order of subgroup H generated by p is 4. \n\nTherefore, the index of <p> in S_5 is the order of S_5 divided by the order of <p>, which is 120/4=30.\n\nHowever, 30 is not an option in the given multiple choice answers, which suggests there may have been a mistake in the step where we calculate the order of <p>. Indeed, let's take another look at the cycle (2,3). Due to the structure of disjoint cycle notation, this tells us that 2 is switched with 3, and vice versa. Since 2 is already mentioned in the first cycle (1,2,5,4), the cycle (2,3) doesn't actually bring any new information, and as such, the order of <p> is simply the length of the first cycle, which is 4.\n\nTherefore the index of <p> in S_5 is still 120/4, but now we understand why the answer is:\n\n(A) 30",

The properties of the factor group are not solely determined by whether the original group is Abelian or non-Abelian. In particular, if we form the factor group with the group and its center, which is always a normal subgroup, the resulting factor group is always Abelian, irrespective of whether the original group is Abelian or non-Abelian. So, we can certainly have a factor group of a non-Abelian group that is Abelian.

To show it, we can use the following argument: If we start with an element g in G, then (since H is normal in G), we have gH=Hg. Further, since K is normal in H, we have hK=Kh for every h in H. Therefore, (gH)K=K(gH) and H(gK)=(gK)H. This implies that gK=Kg, which is the definition of K being a normal subgroup of G. So, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\n(D) False, True",

In group theory, the existence of an element of a certain order does not necessarily imply the existence of some particular number of elements of that order.

This statement is essentially saying that a ring homomorphism is injective if and only if the only element that maps to zero is the zero element itself.\n\nThis is indeed a well-known result in abstract algebra. It comes straight from the definition of injective (or one-to-one) functions: a function is called injective if it never maps distinct elements to the same element. So if our ring homomorphism mapped some non-zero element to zero, it would not be injective, because zero also maps to zero.

The simplest way to do this is by examining the elements 1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), and sqrt(6) to see whether they are linearly independent over Q. \n\nIf these four elements are linearly independent, that means each of these four elements cannot be written as a linear combination of the others, and thus they form a basis for the extension field Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) as a vector space over Q. \n\nThis would mean the degree of the field extension is 4, since there are four elements in the basis.\n\nWe can prove the independence by showing that no solution exists for the equation a*1 + b*sqrt(2) + c*sqrt(3) + d*sqrt(6) = 0, unless a, b, c, and d are all zero. \n\nAssume if possible a solution (a, b, c, d) exist with not all of them are zero, but since a, b, c, and d are all rational, and sqrt(2), sqrt(3) and sqrt(6) are irrational, the equation can only be true if all the coefficients are zero.\n\nSo, these four elements are linearly independent over Q and hence form a basis for the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q.
