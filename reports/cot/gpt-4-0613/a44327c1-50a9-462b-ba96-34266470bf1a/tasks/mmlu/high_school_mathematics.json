            "model_answer": "First, we need to determine how many pins John gave to his brother.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, \"he gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.\" \n\nLet's consider the pile of pins as X, then the number of pins he gave to his brother would be 1/2 * 1/3*X = 1/6*X pins.\n\nIt is also given that after giving the pins to his brother, he had 66 more pins left. \n\nThis indicates that what he gave to his brother is the difference between the total number of pins he had and the 66 pins he had left.\n\nWe can create an equation as follows \nX - 1/6*X = 66\n\nSolving the equation:\nWe'll first make the fractions easier to work with by multiplying by 6 (which is the least common multiple of the denominators):\n\n6X - X = 396\n\nThis simplifies to 5X = 396\n\nSolving for X, we find X = 396/5 = 79.2\n\nBut remember X represents the number of pins in one pile. We know he had two piles of equal number, so let's multiply by 2\n\n2 * 79.2 = 158.4\n\nBut the number of pins should be an integer (as you can't have a fraction of a pin), so it seems like there might be a mistake in computation. It's also surprising that 66 pins is not a factor of the total number of pins and the pins he gave to his brother. \n\nLet's recheck our computation.\n\nWe said the amount of pins that were given to his brother is 1/6 of one pile. Since we have 66 pins left, the remaining in one pile is 5/6. \n\nSo, we say 5/6*X = 66, solving for X now gives X = 79.2\n\nBut we have 2 piles, multiplying by 2 gives us 158.4 again. \n\nOn reconsideration, it appears that there is an error in the problem, as the number of pins should be a whole number, and the solution we have is not. The original problem stated \"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left.\" It is reasonable to assume that each pile contained an integer number of pins and that John could not have given his brother a fractional number of pins, making our above calculation incorrect. \n\nLet's adjust our calculations based on this assumption. \n\nIf John had 66 pins left after he gave his brother some, those 66 pins represent 5/6th of one pile (after 1/6 was given away). So if 5/6th of a pile equals 66 pins then one full pile is 1/(5/6)*66 = 79.2 which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to assume that after giving the pins, John had TWO piles left. So those 66 pins would be half the total amount. \n\nSo, if 1/2*X = 66, then your total X would be 2 * 66 = 132 pins.\n\n(B) 72",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we first need to know what $1200$ factors into. We are interested in this because we want to find integer values $n$ such that $n^2$ divides evenly into $1200$, which means that $n^2$ and $1200$ must share at least a common factor. \n\n$1200$ is equal to: $2^4 * 3^1 * 5^2$\n\nNow, we want to find all possible $n^2$ that can divide into from these factors. \n\nA square number composed of these factors will have an even power for every base. That is, if we represent our number as $2^a*3^b*5^c$, $a$, $b$, and $c$ would all need to be even so that it is a square number.\n\nSince each base in the prime factorization of $1200$ has an even exponent, there are three possibilities for the exponent for each prime factor in $n^2$: two less than the exponent in $1200$ (for example, from $2^4$ we can get $2^2$ and $2^0$), the same as the exponent in $1200$, and zero.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $n^2$ are created by selecting 0, 2 or 4 as the power for 2, 0 or 1 as the power for 3, and 0 or 2 as the power for 5. This gives a total of 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 possible values for $n^2$.\n\nNow we need to find the unique values of $n$ because if two different values of $n$ give the same $n^2$, we only count that $n^2$ once. We will count the number $1$ (which is $n^2$ when $n=1$) only once. \n\nSo we list the actual values of $n$ and then sum them up:\n\n$2^0 * 3^0 * 5^0 = 1$\n$2^1 * 3^0 * 5^0 = 2$\n$2^2 * 3^0 * 5^0 = 4$\n$2^0 * 3^1 * 5^0 = 3$\n$2^1 * 3^1 * 5^0 = 6$\n$2^0 * 3^0 * 5^1 = 5$\n$2^1 * 3^0 * 5^1 = 10$\n\nWe see that there are no duplicates in this list, so simply sum these up:\n\n1 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 5 + 10 = 31\n\nBut there are also larger values including $2^2 * 3^1 * 5^0=12$, $2^2 * 3^0 * 5^1=20$ and $2^1 * 3^1 * 5^1=30$\n\nAdding these to our total gives us:\n\n31 + 12 + 20 + 30 = 93\n\nThis number is not included among the answer choices. We have either made a mistake or the problem is incorrectly written. Checking again, we see that several of the above numbers should have had their square roots taken in order to calculate $n$ instead of $n^2$, as the question asked for the values of $n$ for which $n^2$ is a factor of $1200$.\n\nLet's find n instead of n squared,\n\n$2^0 * 3^0 * 5^0 = 1$\n$2^1 * 3^0 * 5^0 = 2$\n$2^2 * 3^0 * 5^0 = 4$, $n = \\sqrt{2^2 * 3^0 * 5^0} = 2$\n$2^0 * 3^1 * 5^0 = 3$\n$2^1 * 3^1 * 5^0 = 6$, $n = \\sqrt{2^1 * 3^1 * 5^0} = \\sqrt{6} - not~an~integer$\n$2^0 * 3^0 * 5^1 = 5$\n$2^1 * 3^0 * 5^1 = 10$, $n = \\sqrt{2^1 * 3^0 * 5^1} = \\sqrt{10} - not~an~integer$\n$2^2 * 3^1 * 5^0 = 12$, $n = \\sqrt{2^2 * 3^1 * 5^0} = 2*3 = 6$\n$2^2 * 3^0 * 5^1 = 20$, $n = \\sqrt{2^2 * 3^0 * 5^1} = 2*5 = 10$\n$2^1 * 3^1 * 5^1 = 30$, $n = \\sqrt{2^1 * 3^1 * 5^1} = not~an~integer$\n\nn could be 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10. \n\nLet's add these numbers together: 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 10 = 29\n\nThis sum still isn't included among the answer choices. At this point I realize that I have double-counted $n = 2$. \n\nSo the correct sum is 29 - 2 = 27, which is not in the option.\n\nSo, the question seems to be incorrect as 27 is not listed as an answer. Since the closest option listed in the answer choices is D, 39, but this is not the correct answer. \n\nIn fact, there was a mistake in doing exercise. The error is that for any prime factor $p$ of $1200$, we have to take the powers less or equal to the corresponding power in the factorisation of $1200$. In other words, for each prime $p$, we must take all the divisors of the power of $p$ in the factorisation of $1200$ as possible powers of $p$ in $n^2$.\n\nLet's correct the above calculations. \n\nFor prime 2: the power of 2 in factorisation of $1200$ is $4$, and the divisors of $4$ are $1, 2, 4$. For a perfect square, the power of each prime factor must be even, so possible power of 2 in $n^2$ can be $0, 2, 4$.\n\nFor prime 3: the power of 3 in factorisation of $1200$ is $1$, and the only even divisor of $1$ is $1$ itself. So, possible power of 3 in $n^2$ can be $0$ only and we can't consider $3^n$.\n\nFor prime 5: the power of 5 in factorisation of $1200$ is $2$, and the divisors of $2$ are $1, 2$. For a perfect square, the power of each prime factor must be even, so possible power of 5 in $n^2$ can be $0, 2$.\n\nSo the possible values for $n$ are:\n\n$2^0 * 3^0 * 5^0 = 1$\n$2^1 * 3^0 * 5^0 = 2$\n$2^0 * 3^0 * 5^1 = 5$\n$2^2 * 3^0 * 5^0 = 4$\n$2^0 * 3^0 * 5^2 = 25$\n$2^2 * 3^0 * 5^2 = 100$\n\nIf we sum these up we get our answer:\n\n1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 25 + 100 = 137\n\nThis sum still isn't included among the answer choices.\n\nOh, indeed, there is still one mistake when trying to find all the possible values of $n$. The powers of 2, 3 and 5 in $n$ should always be even (or zero), because $n^2$ gives all the prime factors double of their original power. So, $n$ is created by squaring all our potential options for $n^2$ and then taking the square root - and it must still be an integer. So, if $n^2$ has, for example \"one\" 2, i.e., $2^1$, then $n$ would have to be $2^{1/2}$ - but that is not an integer, so we cannot include it.\n\nSo we ignored that values $n$ could only take like $2^{2*1}=4$, $2^{2*2}=16$, $3^{2*0}=1$, $5^{2*0}=1$, $5^{2*1}=25$.\n\nNow let's write down and add up all distinct possible values of n:\n\n$n = 2^0 * 3^0 * 5^0 = 1$\n$n = 2^1 * 3^0 * 5^0 = 2$ ($2^1$ is not an even power, so $n$ shouldn't be $2$)\n$n = 2^2 * 3^0 * 5^0 = ",
