            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, it's important to understand what London dispersion forces are. They are the weakest intermolecular forces and occur as a result of the temporary shifts in the density of the electron clouds of individual atoms. \n\nOption (B) suggests that this force is due to three-dimensional intermolecular bonding present in all covalent substances. While London dispersion forces do occur in covalent substances, they are not due to three-dimensional bonding, but rather temporary charges developing on atoms as electrons move around. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect. \n\nOption (C) suggests that the London dispersion forces are caused by an uneven electron-to-proton ratio found on individual atoms of a molecule, but this is not correct. Uneven electron-to-proton ratio results in ions, not temporary dipoles. So this is also incorrect.\n\nOption (D) is about the differences in electronegativity between individual atoms. Electronegativity differences lead to polar covalent bonds, not to London dispersion forces. Therefore, also this option is not correct.\n\nOption (A) suggests that London dispersion forces occur due to temporary dipoles created by the position of electrons around the nuclei in a molecule. This is the most accurate representation of London dispersion forces. The forces are indeed due to the temporary shifts in electron clouds, creating instantaneous dipoles that induce dipoles in nearby atoms. So this option is correct.\n\n(A) temporary dipoles created by the position of electrons around the nuclei in a molecule",

This means that it's easier to remove an electron from this atom (because the ionization energy is lower), and the atom itself is slightly larger (because the atomic radius is larger).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

Ionic compounds usually have high melting and boiling points, are good conductors of electricity when melted or dissolved in water, but not as a solid. They are also generally soluble in water.\n\nB) Nonpolar covalent bonding happens when two atoms share electrons equally. These compounds are typically gases, liquids or low melting point solids, poor electrical conductors and don't usually dissolve well in water.\n\nC) Covalent network bonding occurs when atoms are connected by a network of covalent bonds. The substances with such bonding often have high melting and boiling points and do not conduct electricity. They are also insoluble in water.\n\nD) Metallic bonding takes place in metals. Metals generally have high melting and boiling points, are good electrical conductors, and do not dissolve in water.\n\nConsidering the properties of the unknown substance - high melting point, poor electricity conductor, and not dissolving in water, we can exclude options A, B, and D because they do not match with all the given properties. \n\nOption A (Ionic Bonding) is ruled out because ionic compounds are good conductors of electricity when melted or in solution, and they generally dissolve in water. Option B (Nonpolar Covalent Bonding) is ruled out because nonpolar covalent compounds usually have low melting points. Option D (Metallic Bonding) is ruled out because metals are good electrical conductors.\n\nTherefore, the substance most likely contains Covalent Network Bonding, because substances with such bonding often have high melting points, do not conduct electricity, and do not dissolve in water, matching all the properties of the unknown substance.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) Covalent network bonding.",

            "model_answer": "The first step in solving this is to look at the reactants and understand what they break down into in water- ammonium bromide (NH4Br) and silver nitrate (AgNO3). When these are broken down individually in water, we get NH4+, Br-, Ag+ and NO3-.\n\nThe second step is to identify any potential products of the reaction between the two. A profound consideration is the solubilities of the possible products. In general, nitrates (NO3-) are soluble in water, so any potential precipitate will likely involve the corresponding cation of the other reactant - in this case, Ag+.\n\nThe next step is to identify the precipitate the reaction will potentially produce. The product of the reaction should be a solid compound that is created from the reactants, per net ionic equations. If it involves Ag+, then the most likely is Silver bromide (AgBr), considering it is characterized by a low solubility in water.\n\nTherefore, the net ionic equation of this reaction should be Ag+(aq) + Br-(aq) \u2192 AgBr(s), as it represents the formation of the solid AgBr from its ions in the solution.\n\nSo, the net ionic equation expected when solutions of NH4Br and AgNO3 are mixed together is (A) Ag+(aq) + Br-(aq) \u2192 AgBr(s).",

            "model_answer": "To resolve this problem, we need to know the mole fraction of nitrogen in the mixture, because the partial pressure of each gas is proportional to its mole fraction. \n\nStep 1: First, we calculate the number of moles of each gas. We use the formula: \nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\nThe molar mass of nitrogen (N2) is ~28.0 g/mol, of argon (Ar) is ~40.0 g/mol, and of water vapor (H2O) is ~18.0 g/mol.\n\nStep 2: Next, we find the mole fraction of nitrogen by dividing the number of moles of nitrogen by the total number of moles.\n\nStep 3: Lastly, we calculate the partial pressure of nitrogen by multiplying the total pressure by the mole fraction of nitrogen.\n\nNow let's calculate:\nFor Nitrogen:\nNumber of moles of Nitrogen = 28.0g / 28.0 g/mol = 1 mol\n\nFor Argon:\nNumber of moles of Argon = 40.0g / 40.0 g/mol = 1 mol\n\nFor Water:\nNumber of moles of Water = 36.0 g / 18.0 g/mol = 2 moles\n\nTotal moles = 1 mol (Nitrogen) + 1 mol (Argon) + 2 moles (Water) = 4 moles\n\nMole fraction of Nitrogen = 1 mol / 4 moles = 0.25\n\nPartial pressure of Nitrogen = Total pressure * Mole fraction of Nitrogen = 2.0 atm * 0.25 = 0.50 atm\n\nThe partial pressure of Nitrogen is therefore 0.50 atm.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n(C) 0.50 atm",
