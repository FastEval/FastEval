            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to look at what each of these methods entail:\n\n(A) Needle aspiration: This is a type of biopsy procedure. In this method, a small needle is used to extract a sample of cells from the breast. This procedure doesn't involve exposure to radiation.\n\n(B) Mammography: This is a type of imaging test that uses low-dose x-rays to examine the breasts. This procedure does involve exposure to radiation because x-rays are a form of radiation.\n\n(C) Mastectomy: This is a surgical procedure to remove the entire breast. This procedure doesn't involve exposure to radiation.\n\n(D) Lumpectomy: This is a surgical procedure to remove a lump or abnormal area in the breast. This procedure doesn't involve exposure to radiation. \n\nThus, we see that only Mammography involves exposure to radiation in the diagnosis of breast cancer.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) Mammography.",

            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each of the answer choices and go through the process of elimination:\n\n(A) Vary from person to person: This is a valid statement. Different people have different preferences, sensitivities, reactions, and attractions. Thus, the areas of the body that are sexually exciting can indeed vary from person to person, making this option a possible answer.\n\n(B) Vary for women depending on the phases of the menstrual cycle: This may also be true as women can experience changes in sexual desire, sensitivity, and pleasure during different phases of the menstrual cycle. So, this option could also be the answer.\n\n(C) Are mainly on the lower portion of the body: This statement is not entirely correct. While some areas in the lower portion of the body may be sexually exciting, it's not limited to this section alone. There are various other areas that can be sexually stimulating. Thus, this option is less likely.\n\n(D) All of the above: Since both options (A) and (B) are both possibly true, and even though (C) is less likely, the best answer would be all the true statements, which is option (D).\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n(D)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each statement one by one:\n\n(A) \"Gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics\" - This is true. Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection and it's commonly treated with antibiotics. \n\n(B) \"Gonorrhea has a high risk of infection with a single exposure\" - This is not exactly true. The risk can largely depend on the type of sexual contact and whether a condom was used. Some sources say the risk from a single act of vaginal intercourse with an infected partner is around 20% to 30%, which is significant, but it's possibly not what some would consider 'high risk'.\n\n(C) \"Gonorrhea is asymptomatic (without symptoms) in only a small percentage of those infected\" - This statement is also not completely correct. It is known that many people with gonorrhea do not show symptoms, especially women. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that in men, it is asymptomatic in about 10% of cases, but in women it is asymptomatic in as many as 50% or more.\n\n(D) \"Gonorrhea infections are limited to genital areas\" - This is not true. Gonorrhea can infect multiple areas of the body, including the throat, rectum, and eyes, in addition to the genitals. \n\nTherefore, only option (A) is unequivocally true.\n\nThe final answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "According to Sigmund Freud, the mind has three components: the id, the ego, and the superego.\n\n1) The id is the primitive, instinctive component that operates on the pleasure principle, which demands immediate satisfaction of its urges. The id is responsible for our basic drives such as food, drink, and pleasure. \n\n2) The ego is the realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the super-ego. It operates on the reality principle, satisfying the id's desires in a manner acceptable in the real world. \n\n3) The superego operates on the morality principle. It incorporates the values and morals of society which are learned from one's parents and others. The superego tries to control impulses of the id that are considered wrong or socially unacceptable.\n\nThe Oedipus complex, also developed by Freud, refers to a child's feelings of desire for the opposite-sex parent and jealousy and rivalry with the same-sex parent, which is not relevant to this question.\n\nIn the scenario, the temptation of going out and having fun outweighed the need to study for a test, indicating the dominance of pleasure and desire over a more realistic and socially acceptable behavior (like studying for a test). Therefore, the id would have been dominant.\n\n(A) the id",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Sociobiologists study the social behavior of animals (including humans) in the context of evolution, natural selection, and survival of the fittest. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect. Paraphilias generally do not guarantee the survival of the species. They are often seen as deviations from the norm, not something that contributes to survival of the species overall. \n\nOption (C) is incorrect because left brain/right brain differences between the genders do not directly relate or contribute to the incidence of paraphilias. \n\nOption (D) is incorrect because it implies a value judgment (that male brains are \"better\" developed) which isn't scientifically founded or useful in explaining such a complex behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, Option (B) is actually on track with what sociobiology entails. It suggests that men might have evolved to respond to a wider array of sexual stimuli, and this could conceivably include paraphilias. The difference wouldn't necessarily be one of better/worse or more/less developed, but simply a different distribution of sexual interests.\n\nSo, in answering this question, it seems plausible that evolution could encourage a wider range of sexual responses in males if these variations improved males' chances of reproducing successfully under various circumstances. This may explain the difference in occurrence of paraphilias between genders.\n\nIn conclusion:\n(B) evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli.",

            "question": "According to a study by Sprecher, Barbee, and Schwartz (1995), women were more likely than men to have ________ following their first act of intercourse.\n\n(A) felt glad\n(B) felt fear\n(C) experienced guilt\n(D) experienced regret",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, let's consider a bit of general knowledge and common sense. Although every individual's experience may differ, women, on a larger societal scale, often face certain amounts of guilt or regret following their first act of intercourse due to a variety of societal and cultural factors.\n\nThe four options provided are:\n(A) felt glad \n(B) felt fear\n(C) experienced guilt\n(D) experienced regret\n\n(A) felt glad seems unlikely to be the answer, as first experiences may not always be associated with positive feelings. Also, if either men or women were more likely to feel glad following their first act of intercourse, it would be an interesting but surprising conclusion.\n\n(B) felt fear is also an unusual response to such an event, although it could be possible. Still, it would be concerning if a study found that women were more likely to feel fear compared to men following their first act of intercourse.\n\nOption (C) experienced guilt and (D) experienced regret are related emotions often tied to feelings of remorse over actions one wishes they had not done. Both are common responses due to societal pressures and expectations, especially for women. \n\nHowever, regret is often a subsequent emotion that arises after guilt. Regret is when you wish you could 'undo' a past action and is usually a more profound emotion compared to guilt. Without the specific context provided by the study, it is hard to pinpoint the precise emotion women were more likely to have following their first act of intercourse, but either guilt or regret could be the correct option.\n\nWithout the actual study on hand, this inference is based on the general knowledge that societal and cultural pressures may lead to guilt or regret in women following their first act intercourse. Between guilt and regret, the latter seems a more severe and consequential sentiment, so it is potentially more likely for a study to highlight it.\n\nFrom all the choices, (D) experienced regret is the best answer, given this abstract scenario without further context. \n\n(D) experienced regret",

            "model_answer": "Attachment theory suggests that the type of relationships we form as adults are influenced by the relationships we had with our caregivers as children. There are typically three types of attachment styles recognized: secure, avoidant, and anxious-ambivalent.\n\n(A) A secure lover would be comfortable with intimacy and not typically be perceived as \"desperate\" in their advances. A secure lover would also not have a typical pattern of putting off their romantic interests. Therefore, Joe is unlikely to be a secure lover.\n\n(B) An avoidant lover, on the other hand, would typically keep a distance from their romantic interests. They tend to be independent and uncomfortable with too much closeness or intimacy. Given that Joe is trying to get closer to Helen and appears to be comfortable with getting intimate, he would not fit the description of an avoidant lover.\n\n(D) A passionate lover isn't a recognized category in attachment theory. \n\n(C) An anxious-ambivalent lover tends to crave intimacy. They often worry about their partner's commitment and need continuous reassurances. They may also display clingy and needy behavior, which can sometimes make their partners feel overwhelmed. Joe's behavior of desperately trying to get close to Helen fits in with this description. His pattern of putting off women might also suggest that his anxious-ambivalent behavior affects his relationships.\n\nTherefore, based on the facts, Joe seems to best fit the description of an anxious-ambivalent lover.\n\nAnswer: (C)",
