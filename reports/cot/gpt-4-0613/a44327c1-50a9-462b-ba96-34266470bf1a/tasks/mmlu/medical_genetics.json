            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Robertsonian translocation is a chromosomal abnormality that involves rearrangements of the chromosomes. In this type of translocation, two acrocentric or submetacentric chromosomes fuse near the centromere region with loss of the short arms. An acrocentric chromosome is a chromosome in which the centromere is located quite near one end, so that one chromosomal arm is noticeably shorter than the other. \n\nThe 'long arm' of a chromosome is referred to in terms of 'p' (petit, French for small) denoting the short arm, and 'q' denoting the long arm. The centromere is the homogeneous part of a chromosome that attaches it to the spindle during cell division.\n\nHistones are the proteins around which DNA wraps, to form a compact, organized chromosome structure, so it does not involve a chromosomal translocation.\n\nTelomeres are specialized structures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes which are associated with chromosome stability and longevity. They don't fuse together in Robertsonian translocation.\n\nWith all this information, we can rule out Telomeres, Histones, and Ends of the long arms, leaving us with Centromeres which are really the site of fusion in a Robertsonian translocation.\n\n(B) centromeres.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Zinc finger proteins are known for their characteristic structures that interact with various molecular targets. One of these known targets is DNA, allowing these proteins to play key roles in gene regulation by acting as transcription factors. The zinc finger design is versatile and zinc fingers can be combined in several different ways to achieve specific DNA-binding specificity, strengthening the interaction with DNA.\n\nSimilarly, the helix-turn-helix motif is a major structural motif capable of binding DNA. It is a common binding domain utilized by transcription factors, which are proteins that increase or decrease the transcription of specific genes.\n\nTherefore, both zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are associated with gene transcription regulation through binding to DNA. These properties differentiate them from being involved exclusively in the control of translation (which involves mRNA, not DNA), being components of ribosomes (which are not proteins but complex entities of rRNA and proteins), or being part of the hemoglobin in blood cells (a role reserved for specific globin proteins).\n\nThus, I would suggest:\n\n(A) types of DNA-binding proteins",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "X-linked recessive conditions are genetic diseases that occur due to mutations in genes on the X chromosome. They are expressed in males who have a single X chromosome and hence, one copy of the faulty gene is sufficient to cause the disease. In females, there are two X chromosomes and both need to have the faulty gene for the disease to be expressed, making such diseases less frequent in females.\n\nThe frequency of affected males is given as 0.10.\n\nIn females, both X chromosomes must contain the faulty gene for them to express the recessive disease. Therefore, the frequency of affected females is the square of the frequency of affected males (since the faulty gene must be present on both of the female's X chromosomes).\n\nConsequently, to find the frequency of affected females, we would square the given frequency of affected males, which is 0.10. \n\nSo, the frequency of affected females is (0.10)^2 = 0.01\n\nTherefore, we select the corresponding option.\n\n(A) 0.01",

            "model_answer": "The structure of DNA is composed of two strands of nucleotides. These nucleotides use what is known as base-pairing to connect to each other across the two strands. There are four nucleotides in DNA: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). \n\nAccording to the rules of base pairing in DNA, adenine always pairs with thymine, and cytosine always pairs with guanine. This is due to the nature of the molecules and allows for the DNA double helix structure to be maintained across the two strands. \n\nTherefore, in DNA, adenine most regularly pairs with thymine.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) thymine.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) or hyperpyrexia is a condition that causes a severe reaction to particular drugs used during general anaesthesia. Individuals who have a mutation in the RYR1 gene, which guides the production of a protein that plays an essential role in muscles, are susceptible to this disorder. The mutated gene leads to an abnormal ryanodine receptor protein being produced, causing calcium to be released from the muscles excessively when triggered by certain medicines. This excessive release of calcium can cause a rapid increase in muscle metabolism, which can lead to the symptoms of MH.\n\nThe mutation in the RYR1 gene is passed down through generations in families, which indicates that the disorder has a genetic basis. According to several medical and genetic resources, MH is hereditary and is passed on in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that an affected individual has a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of their offsprings, regardless of gender. This pattern of inheritance shows one mutated copy of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. \n\nSo, the pattern of inheritance shown by malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is autosomal dominant.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

            "model_answer": "This question is likely referring to the development of human genetic research, inferred from the phrase, \"Mapping of human chromosomes.\"\n\nLet's break down each answer:\n\n(A) \"Has been restricted to the sex chromosomes because of small family sizes\" - This is not accurate. The mapping of human chromosomes is not limited to sex chromosomes. The human genome project has made it possible to map genes on all 23 pairs of chromosomes, so this option can be discarded.\n\n(B) \"Proceeded much more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available.\" - This statement is correct. As more DNA markers or genetic markers became available, it made the understanding and mapping of human chromosomes much easier and more precise. The more landmarks, or markers, we have, the more detailed our map can be.\n\n(C) \"Has determined that the number of linkage groups is about twice the number of chromosomes\" - This is not in alignment with the conventional understanding of linkage groups, each chromosome makes up one linkage group. So, the number of linkage groups is equivalent to the number of chromosomes. \n\n(D) \"Has demonstrated that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes\" - This statement isn't accurate because a significant proportion of human DNA does not code for proteins. Non-coding regions of DNA are far from nonessential; they have vital roles in regulating gene expression, among other things.\n\nGiven these detailed explanations, it's clear that answer choice B best represents the significant progress in the mapping of human chromosomes as large numbers of DNA markers became available.\n\n(B)",

Research has shown that such extreme stressors can have significant effects on offspring.\n\n(B) Natural disasters: Similar to war, natural disasters can also result in traumatic events for parents, including displacement and extreme stress, which can affect their offspring.\n\n(C) Hunger: Parental exposure to severe hunger or malnutrition can also impact the future generations.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Exon skipping is a process associated with the splicing of pre-mRNA during RNA processing. This process removes introns and splices exons together to form the mature mRNA. During this process, some exons may be skipped, leading to the production of a different protein from the one that would normally be produced.\n\nA nonsense mutation is a DNA sequence mutation that results in a premature stop codon, or signals the end of the protein translation too early, thus leading to shorter, unfinished, and usually nonfunctional proteins. This is not directly related to the process of exon skipping.\n\nRegulatory mutations are changes to non-coding sequences that control the expression of genes, such as promoters and enhancers. While these may conceivably influence splicing indirectly, they are not directly responsible for the skipping of exons.\n\nA silent mutation is a mutation that changes a single nucleotide, but does not change the resultant amino acid due to the redundancy of the genetic code, thus having no effect on the protein produced. This also is unrelated to exon skipping.\n\nRNA processing mutations, on the other hand, directly impact steps like splicing and could lead to exon skipping if the regulatory sequences determining which parts of the pre-mRNA are exons and introns are affected.\n\nSo, exon skipping is directly associated with RNA processing mutations.\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations.",
