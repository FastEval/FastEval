An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim.

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the null hypothesis.\nIn this case, the null hypothesis is that the mean weight of the aspirin tablets is 300 mg. This hypothesis is tested against the alternative hypothesis that the mean weight is not 300 mg.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the sample mean and variance.\nThe sample mean (mean of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303) is 301.14 mg and the sample standard deviation is 2.23 mg.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the test statistic.\nThe test statistic for this two-tailed t test is calculated using the formula (sample mean - null hypothesis mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size)). In this case, the test statistic is (301.14 - 300) / (2.23 / sqrt(7)) = 1.54.\n\nStep 4: Determine the degrees of freedom.\nThe degrees of freedom in a t test is the sample size minus 1. Here the sample size is 7, so the degrees of freedom is 7 - 1 = 6.\n\nStep 5: Find the P-value.\nThe P-value for a two-tailed test is the probability that the test statistic is as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed test statistic in both directions. This is calculated as twice the probability that the test statistic is greater than the absolute value of the observed test statistic.\n\nSince our test was two-tailed, and our degrees of freedom was 6, the correct expression to find the P-value should be 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6.",

This involves finding the portion of riders which fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean, as most data in a normal distribution falls within this range. In simpler terms, we need to find the z-scores for each interval and select the one that contains the most riders. The z-score is calculated by subtracting the mean from each wait time and dividing by the standard deviation.\n\nCalculate the z-scores for each time interval:\n\n(A) 0 to 31.7 minutes: Z1 = (0-35)/10 = -3.5, Z2 = (31.7-35)/10 = -0.33\n(B) 31.7 to 39.3 minutes: Z1 = (31.7-35)/10 = -0.33, Z2 = (39.3-35)/10 = 0.43\n(C) 25.3 to 44.7 minutes: Z1 = (25.3-35)/10 = -0.97, Z2 = (44.7-35)/10 = 0.97\n(D) 25.3 to 35: Z1 = (25.3-35)/10 = -0.97, Z2 = 0 (Because it is the mean)\n\nIn a standard normal distribution (Z-score), approximately 68% of all values fall within 1 standard deviation from the mean, 95% within 2 standard deviations and 99.7% within 3 standard deviations.\n\nIn this case, looking at the information about z-scores and intervals above, the interval (C) 25.3 to 44.7 minutes fits into this as it has a z-(score) of approximately -1 to 1 which would include 68% of the data.\n\nAs such, the time interval with the highest number of riders, or the 'shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders', is (C) 25.3 to 44.7 minutes.\n\nSo, the answer is (C).",

            "model_answer": "(A) The given statement is incorrect. If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level it does not automatically imply that there is enough evidence to reject it at the 5% level. The percentage level, also known as the significance level, refers to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is true. A lower significance level means a lower chance of rejecting the null hypothesis, thus a test with a 10% level of significance is less stringent than the one with a 5% level.\n\n(B) The decision on whether to use a one- or two-sided test should typically be decided before the data are gathered. If it is decided after the data are gathered, it can introduce bias in the hypothesis testing process because the choice could be influenced by the data itself.\n\n(C) This statement is also incorrect. The hypothesis test conducted at the 1% level does not refer to there being a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis. Rather it means that you are allowing a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is, in fact, true. This is referred to as the Type I error rate, and it is not the same as the probability that the null hypothesis is false.\n\n(D) The statement is correct. The power of a statistical test measures the test's ability to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. It basically measures the probability of avoiding a Type II error\u2014failing to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative is true. High power is desirable because it means the test is more likely to detect an effect if one really exists.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(D)",
