            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The process of choosing the key attribute in successful marathon running involves understanding what a marathon is and what it requires. A marathon is a long-distance running race with an official distance of 42.195 kilometers, usually run as a road race. This means the runner is engaged in continuous physical activity for a prolonged period.\n\n(A) Strength is important in many sports but it refers more to the maximum amount of force a muscle or muscle group can exert. While it contributes to running performance, you won't exclusively rely on it for a marathon.\n\n(B) Power also contributes to running performance, especially in short-distance sprints. It involves the ability to exert maximum muscular contraction instantly in an explosive burst of movements, which is not the key attribute in long-distance running.\n\n(C) Stride length plays a part in the efficiency of a runner. However, a longer stride does not necessarily translate into a better marathon performance. There's also stride frequency to be considered, and striking a balance between the two is usually what matters for runners.\n\n(D) Stamina, on the other hand, is the ability to sustain prolonged physical or mental effort. Given that a marathon requires continuous exertion over a long distance, this attribute seems to align best with what is required for successful marathon running.\n\nTaking these points into consideration, the key attribute in successful marathon running is understood to be the ability to maintain a continuous physical effort over a long period. Hence, the answer is \n\n(D) stamina.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, let's start by understanding what dementia is. Dementia is a term used to describe different brain disorders that trigger a loss of brain function. These conditions are all usually progressive and generally affect memory, thinking, behaviour and emotion.\n\nNow, we'll look into each of the given options:\n\n(A) Alzheimer's disease: This is the most common form of dementia. Its symptoms include memory loss, confusion, difficulty with speech and understanding, mood changes, among others. \n\n(B) Cerebrovascular disease: This refers to conditions that limit or stop blood flow to the brain, often causing strokes. A stroke can sometimes lead to a type of dementia called vascular dementia, but it's not the most common cause of dementia.\n\n(C) Lewy body dementia: This is a type of progressive dementia that leads to a decline in thinking, reasoning and independent function because of abnormal microscopic deposits that damage brain cells. While it's one of the common types of dementia, it's not the most common.\n\n(D) HIV infection: Though severe, untreated HIV infection can indeed lead to cognitive issues or HIV-associated dementia, it is definitely not the most common cause of dementia.\n\nConsidering this information, the Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, affecting an estimated 5.3 million people in the United States. Moreover, in the UK, Alzheimer's Society reports that Alzheimer's disease is also the most common cause of dementia, affecting around 520,000 people.\n\nAfter analyzing the information, we can conclude that Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n(A) Alzheimer's disease.",

            "model_answer": "Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. It can occur within seconds or minutes of exposure to something you're allergic to, such as a peanut or the venom from a bee sting. \n\nThe common symptoms of anaphylaxis include the following:\n\n(A) Stridor, or a high-pitched wheezing sound caused by disrupted airflow. Stridor may also be called musical breathing or extrathoracic airway obstruction. Airflow is usually disrupted by a blockage in the larynx (voice box) or trachea (windpipe).\n\n(C) Severe wheeze is another common symptom of anaphylaxis, which is caused by the constriction of the bronchial tubes in the lungs due to the allergic reaction.\n\n(D) Skin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin (Rash) are a very common symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\n(B) Bradycardia or a slower than normal heart rate is typically NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis. In fact, anaphylaxis is usually associated with tachycardia, or an abnormally rapid heart rate due to the body's release of adrenaline in response to the allergic reaction.\n\nSo, the symptom that is NOT associated with anaphylaxis amongst the listed options is Bradycardia.\n\nAnswer: (B) Bradycardia.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Let's elucidate the options given individually:\n\n(A) An increasing number of sprints does not directly correlate with an augmented anaerobic contribution. Although the anaerobic system is highly active during short bursts of high-intensity exercise like sprinting, there is a limit to how long this system can function as the body's primary energy source, due to the build-up of lactic acid.\n\n(B) The pH of the muscle may decrease during intensive exercises like sprinting due to the accumulation of lactic acid. However, it usually doesn\u2019t fall below 6.9, even under the most intense exercise conditions. A pH below 6.0 would indicate a severe, potentially life-threatening acidosis condition.\n\n(C) Intensive exercises like repeated sprints may indeed lower blood glucose concentration, but it is unlikely to fall below 3 mmol/L (hypoglycemia) unless the individual is fasting or suffering from a metabolic disorder.\n\n(D) With an increasing number of sprints, the body will eventually start to rely more on the aerobic system (which uses oxygen to convert glucose into energy), since the anaerobic system cannot sustain energy production for an extended period of time due to the build-up of lactic acid.\n\nConsidering all these explanations, the most appropriate answer appears to be option D. The more sprints an individual performs, the more the body will need to rely on its aerobic metabolism to produce the required energy, as the initial anaerobic contribution won't be able to keep up with the increasing energy demand.\n\nAs such, the answer is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what diplopia is. Diplopia is a condition in which a person sees double images of a single object. It can occur in one or both eyes.\n\n(A) The statement \"Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered\" is not entirely true. While it's true that covering one eye can often alleviate diplopia because it removes the double image from the affected eye, there's a type of diplopia called monocular diplopia that can occur even if one eye is covered. So, this cannot be the answer.\n\n(B) The claim that \"The outer image is always the false image\" is general and not always true. In diplopia, it's often difficult to tell which is the false image. This can depend on many factors, including the underlying cause of the diplopia, the direction of gaze, and the patient's perception.\n\n(C) The assertion \"A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards\" is not absolutely true. The fourth cranial nerve (or trochlear nerve) controls the superior oblique muscle of the eye which helps in downward, internal rotation and inward eye movement. While damage to the fourth nerve can lead to diplopia, it is not solely associated with looking upwards.\n\n(D) The statement \"A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint\" is accurate. The sixth cranial nerve (abducens nerve) controls the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for outward eye movement. If this nerve is damaged, it can lead to a convergent squint, which is when the eyes do not align properly and turn inwards. This can cause diplopia.\n\nAfter evaluating all the options based on the concepts of diplopia and nerve palsies, the correct answer appears to be option D.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sodium bicarbonate, commonly referred to as baking soda, has been widely used by athletes for its potential ergogenic effects, meaning it can enhance performance. Here's why:\n\nWhen you exercise, your muscles produce lactic acid, creating an acidic environment in your body. This acid can cause fatigue, making intense physical activities, like middle distance running, harder.\n\nSodium bicarbonate is an alkaline substance. When ingested, it can help neutralize or buffer the acid build-up in your body thereby elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid. \n\nBy elevating the pH and buffering capacity, sodium bicarbonate allows for a faster efflux (or outflow) of hydrogen ions from the muscles. This efflux of hydrogen ions is key because hydrogen ions are what contribute to the acidity in the muscles. So, by facilitating a faster efflux of these ions, sodium bicarbonate helps reduce muscle acidity and subsequently reduces fatigue experienced during strenuous exercise.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Firstly, the mitochondria are often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell because they are responsible for producing the energy necessary for vital cellular functions by breaking down fatty acids and other molecules.\n\nBefore fatty acids can be broken down to generate energy, they must first be transported into the mitochondria. This transportation process is where our answer lies.\n\n(A) Thiokinase is an enzyme involved in the initial stages of fatty acid oxidation. It helps add a high-energy phosphate group to a fatty acid to form a fatty acyl-adenylate. Although it's a crucial part of the fatty acid oxidation process, thiokinase is not directly involved with the transportation of fatty acids into the mitochondria.\n\n(B) Coenzyme A (CoA) is a crucial molecule involved in several key biochemical reactions, including the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids. However, CoA alone is not responsible for transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria.\n\n(C) Acetyl-CoA is a molecule that plays key roles in protein, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism. It is generated in mitochondria through the oxidation of fatty acids, among other processes, but it does not transport fatty acids into the mitochondria.\n\n(D) Carnitine is crucial for transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria. The fatty acid is linked to carnitine to form acylcarnitine, which can be readily transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Once inside, the fatty acid is released and can undergo beta-oxidation to generate energy.\n\nFrom the above analysis, it's clear that the correct answer is (D) carnitine. It is the molecule specifically involved in facilitating the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria.\n\n(D) carnitine.",
