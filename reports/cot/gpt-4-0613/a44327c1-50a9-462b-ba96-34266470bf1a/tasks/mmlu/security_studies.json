            "model_answer": "The responsibility to protect is an international security and human rights norm which stipulates that states have a responsibility to protect their populations from mass atrocity crimes such as genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\n\nThis responsibility is structured around three pillars:\n\n1) The responsibility to prevent: that is, the responsibility to address root causes of conflicts that might lead to atrocities.\n\n2) The responsibility to react: that is, the responsibility to respond to situations of compelling human need with an appropriate measure, which may encompass sanctions, international prosecution, and in extreme cases military intervention.\n\n3) The responsibility to rebuild: that is, the responsibility to provide, particularly after a military intervention, full assistance with recovery, reconstruction and reconciliation.\n\nFrom these three pillars, we can see that options A, B and D are part of the \"Responsibility to Protect\" framework. This leaves option C, the \"responsibility to remain sovereign\", which is not a part of the responsibility to protect, as sovereignty is an inherent aspect of being a state, not a responsibility within this specific norm.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) The responsibility to remain sovereign.",

So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal.

            "model_answer": "The task asks to determine if environmental changes can be reconciled with national security interests.\n\nFirst, let's consider each choice:\n\n(A) This choice indicates that environmental challenges may have a positive impact on economic growth by spurring diversification and research. This could indirectly strengthen national security by advancing military capabilities. However, while this perspective suggests some harmony between environmental challenges and national security, it does not cover the full scope of environmental changes, which can also include harmful effects like resource scarcity and climate change.\n\n(B) This choice represents the argument that environmental changes can undermine national security by weakening the economic foundation sustaining military capacity. This directly links environmental issues to national security, but it frames this link as a mostly negative one, suggesting more of a conflict than a reconciliation.\n\n(C) This choice asserts that environmental problems are primarily internal, leaving external military threats as a primary concern. The implication here is that while environmental issues might present challenges, they don't necessarily directly affect a nation's ability to respond to external threats. This offers a sort of reconciliation, but only by divorcing environmental issues from national security ones, which doesn't fully address the question.\n\n(D) Choice D suggests that all of the above options are valid. This would mean that environmental changes can simultaneously drive technological advancement in military programs, undermine the economic base that supports military capacity, and remain largely separate from the question of external military threats.\n\nThough the previous options offer different perspectives on the relationship between environmental changes and national security, none of them individually fully capture the multifaceted ways these two areas can intersect. The interplay between environmental changes and national security can be both positive and negative and can involve both direct and indirect effects. This complexity suggests a certain reconciliation is possible, though it would likely require carefully balanced policies.\n\nWith this reasoning, the best answer would be:\n\n(D) All of these options.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The human security concept is often criticized for its broad approach. While it clearly wants to address manifold areas like economic, food, health, environmental, personal, community, and political security, this wide range causes difficulties in terms of measurements, implementation, and policy making. The comprehensiveness of the concept often leads to lack of clarity, rendering it impracticable in some discussions. In contrast, the concepts of neo-colonialism or the promotion of global capitalism are more specific claims and while they might be linked to some elements of the human security concept, they do not generally serve as a common criticism against the concept. Therefore, one could argue that these claims are too narrowly directed and are not based on a comprehensive understanding of the concept as they pick out single aspects.\n\nConsequently, the most common criticism is that the human security concept is too encompassing, not focusing enough, which is a substantial argument based on the concept as a whole and its practical implications.\n\nHence, the correct answer would be:\n\n(C) Human security is too broad.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

The use of bilateral approaches for information sharing suggests cooperation but mostly on a one-on-one basis with other affected countries. \n\n(B) The second response represents an approach where steps were taken to reduce differences between countries by harmonizing legislation and strengthening police capacity and networking. This suggests a more proactive approach in trying to address the causes of TNC rather than treating the symptoms.\n\n(C) This option describes the response style that has been heavily influenced by the US war on drugs. This style is characterized by an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with various pressures to make states increase their regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n\n(D) Finally, the last option portrays a response style that arose with the Global War on Terror. Here, the emphasis is on using military technology and intelligence to combat the problem rather than finding and addressing the underlying conditions that cause TNC.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Option (A) focuses on national security and domestic responses.\n- Option (B) emphasizes harmonization, increased police capacity and targeting perpetrators.\n- Option (C) reflects an approach influenced by the US war on drugs that focuses on bilateral and multilateral cooperation and regulation enforcement.\n- Option (D) represents the response style emerging from the Global War on Terror that relies on military technology and intelligence.\n\nThe final answer based on these observations will be:\n\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\n(D)",

This could cause difficulties in policy formation due to the broadened scope of ideas and inputs, but the option does not explicitly state this as a problem. So, this is not a direct answer to the question. \n\nOption (B) talks about the changing role of think tanks, focusing more on theory that is resistant to politicization rather than policy-making. This could potentially be seen as a problem in the academe-policy interaction, but it is more of a modification in the functioning of think tanks rather than an issue arisen directly from the institutionalization of the interaction.

This, however, does not seem to present a problem for policy in the context of the institutionalization of the academe-policy interaction. It just provides information about one specific discipline.\n\nOption (D) points out how think tanks, universities and policymakers are becoming more interrelated, leading to policy mergers at all levels. This institutional blurring could be seen as a potential problem for policy in the context of institutionalization of the academe-policy interaction.

Property Rights are not explicitly mentioned in the 10-point prescription but are implied in the context of deregulation and liberalization policies that create a favorable environment for entrepreneurs and the protection of new creations and inventions.\n\n(D) Nationalization: state enterprises should be protected.

The reform package recommended privatization and liberalization, not increased state control. \n\nComparing the core principles of the Washington Consensus to the given options, it's clear that option D is not one of the 10 steps.\n\nThus, the answer is (D) Nationalization: state enterprises should be protected.",
