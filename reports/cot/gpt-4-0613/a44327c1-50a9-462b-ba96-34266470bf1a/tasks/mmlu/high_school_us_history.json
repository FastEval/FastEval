            "model_answer": "The text does not provide direct information regarding how the United States acquired the Oregon Territory. Thus, to answer this question, we have to rely on external knowledge. \n\nHistorically, the Oregon Territory was claimed by both the United States and Great Britain. After years of joint occupation and negotiation, the Oregon Treaty was signed in 1846, which divided the Oregon territory along the 49th parallel, giving land south of this line to the United States.\n\nTherefore, taking into account this historical context, we can see that it wasn't France, but Great Britain, with which the U.S. made a treaty for the Oregon Territory, answering option A incorrect. It was not bought from the Native Americans, refuting option B. While U.S. settlers did migrate to the Oregon Territory, they were not the first to arrive, and their arrival did not directly result in U.S. possession of the region, so answer option C is incorrect. The Oregon Territory was obtained via a negotiated treaty with Great Britain, which makes D the correct answer.\n\n(D) Great Britain ceded it to the United States as part of a negotiated treaty.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to analyze the given excerpt from the Charter of Privileges granted by William Penn. Within this charter, Penn openly gives freedom of conscience in regards to religious profession and worship. This ensures that anyone living in Pennsylvania and its territories that believe in One almighty God have the right to practice their own religion without prejudice or persecution. No one, according to this Charter, would be forced to follow or fund a religious organization that contradicted their own belief.\n\nSecond, we must apply our understanding of the Charter to the question. By these written declarations, it is clear that Penn intended Pennsylvania to be a place where religious freedom was upheld. The Charter suggests an open and diverse range of religions and religious practices would be allowed and protected under the government. \n\nLastly, we sift through the given answer options with the knowledge we've gathered. Option (A) suggests Pennsylvania became a religiously diverse colony, which aligns with our understanding of the Charter. In contrast, option (B) contradicts this understanding. Options (C) and (D) also do not align with Penn's Charter. Neither witch hunting, popular superstition, nor hostility to traditional religious practices are insinuated or encouraged in the Charter's text.\n\nSo based on the evidence at hand, option (A) is the most fitting answer.\n \n(A) one of the most religiously diverse colonies in British America.",

Roosevelt at that time.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt did not react to these challenges by announcing that he would not run for re-election, therefore option (A) is incorrect. Neither did he divert people's attention by allowing the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor, as this event occurred much later, in 1941, and was part of World War II context, not to mention it was an unprovoked attack, so option (C) can also be discarded. Finally, Roosevelt did not urge Congress to cut taxes and deregulate the economy, this would actually contradict his New Deal policies, which involved more government intervention and regulatory policies, hence option (D) is incorrect.\n\nThe challenges that Long and others presented, did however lead Roosevelt to spearhead the passage of a series of legislative acts known as the Second New Deal. The goal of these acts was to provide further economic relief and recovery for those affected by The Great Depression. This series of legislative acts included welfare programs like Social Security, which suggests a form of wealth redistribution, similarly to what Long had proposed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Launching the Second New Deal, a series of legislative acts including Social Security.\n\nAnswer: (B)",
