            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "The provided clinical vignette is describing a patient with decreased sensation and characteristics of a tingling and numbness over a specific area over her left thigh. Her medical history is significant for a pulmonary embolism, for which she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter and treatment with anticoagulants, but suffered complications including a hematoma and retroperitoneal hemorrhage.\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization - While strokes or cerebral infarction can contribute to numbness and tingling, these symptoms are usually not localized to a specific small region, like the lateral aspect of the thigh. \n\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter - IVC filter placement could theoretically result in a systemic embolization or local complications such as filter migration. However, these complications are unlikely to lead to localized numbness and tingling on the thigh.\n\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve - This nerve provides sensation to the lateral aspect of the thigh, the area where she is experiencing decreased sensation. Disruption to the path of this nerve can lead to a condition known as meralgia paresthetica, which results in tingling, numbness and burning sensation in the outer part of your thigh.\n\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh - If there was significant hematoma in the left thigh, it could have been seen or palpated on physical examination. There might have been signs of muscular weakness and pain, but the only symptoms this patient reports are focused on sensory loss. \n\nBased on these considerations, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is meralgia paresthetica, secondary to compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.",

            "question": "A 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female is admitted to the hospital at 39\u00a0weeks' gestation in active labor. She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated. The most likely diagnosis is\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions\n(B) lower uterine retraction ring\n(C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction\n(D) primary dysfunctional labor",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "This patient's labor started normally but has now slowed significantly, which is a sign of uterine dysfunction. Dysfunctional labor can be categorized into 2 types: hypotonic and hypertonic. Hypotonic contractions are less frequent, less intense, and shorter than normal. Hypertonic contractions, on the other hand, are unusually strong, long, and close together. In this case, the patient\u2019s contractions are described as few, intermittent, and weak, which suggests she is experiencing hypotonic contractions.\n\nHypotonic uterine dysfunction typically occurs in the active phase of labor (cervical dilation of 3\u20137 cm and/or 100% effacement) rather than early labor or the latent phase (D, primary dysfunctional labor). During the latent phase, the progress of labor is slower than expected. Since this woman's labor has suddenly slowed in the active phase, it is unlikely to be primary dysfunctional labor.\n\nBraxton Hicks contractions (A) are intermittent uterine contractions that occur in many women during pregnancy. These contractions are considered to be painless and do not cause changes in the cervix. Therefore, it could not result in this woman\u2019s 7 cm cervical dilation. \n\nLower uterine retraction ring (B) is a complication of obstructed labor, which is ruled out by the physical examination. Moreover, it is typically associated with severe pain and fetal distress, neither of which was noted in the presentation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis in this scenario is hypotonic uterine dysfunction.\n\n(C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction",

His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04). Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation of these study results?\n\n(A) The findings are clinically and statistically significant\n(B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant\n(C) The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant\n(D) The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The difference in symptom resolution times between the new drug and the placebo is 0.3 days fewer (6.4 days compared to 6.7 days). In practical terms, this is a relatively small difference and may not have a clinically significant impact on the patient's disease course. Clinically significant results typically refer to results that would change the course of treatment or the patient's experience of the illness. In this case, a change of less than half a day may not make a substantial difference to how the patient feels or how the illness progresses.\n\nFrom a statistical perspective, the p-value is 0.04. In most research, a p-value less than 0.05 is generally considered statistically significant. This means that the probability of observing the given data (or data more extreme) if the null hypothesis is true (i.e., there is no difference between the drug and placebo) is less than 5%. So, in this case, statistically, the difference between the drug and placebo groups is significant, even though the actual difference in symptom resolution time is quite small.\n\nTherefore, the findings can be viewed as statistically significant but not clinically significant. \n\nThe correct answer is (B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant.",

            "model_answer": "This patient's murmur, radiofemoral delay, and radiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy are suggestive of coarctation of the aorta. Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital heart defect which causes narrowing of the aorta, usually leading to high blood pressure before the point of coarctation (upper body) and lower pressure past the constriction (lower body). This is why the brachial pulses are strong while the femoral pulses are weak, and there is a delay between the radial and femoral pulses. \n\nCoarctation of the aorta is associated with several complications. Hypertension is common because the left ventricle has to pump against the pressure of the narrowed aorta, which leads to left ventricular hypertrophy. This prolonged pressure load on the left ventricle can result in heart failure over time.\n\n- (A) Atrial fibrillation is not directly linked to aortic coarctation.\n- (B) Cor pulmonale, also known as right-sided heart failure, is typically associated with chronic lung diseases, which is not the case here.\n- (C) Systemic hypertension is a common complication of coarctation of the aorta, and given the high blood pressure and strong brachial pulses noted in this child, is a major risk.\n- (D) Tricuspid valve regurgitation is typically caused by dilatation of the right ventricle, which does not seem to be the case here.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) Systemic hypertension.",

However, it functions as an inhibitor of another process related to fatty acids - their oxidation.\n\nWhen the concentration of malonyl-CoA increases, it binds to and inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I), which is the enzyme that transports fatty acyl-CoAs into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation. Beta-oxidation is the process by which fatty acids are broken down to generate acetyl-CoA, which can be used in the citric acid cycle to generate energy.\n\nGiven this information, it's clear that an increase in malonyl-CoA concentration would inhibit the oxidation of fatty acids, not their synthesis.

These are symptoms that could suggest depression, which is common in patients with terminal illnesses such as this patient's metastatic ovarian cancer. The patient is already on fluoxetine for major depressive disorder, but given her ongoing symptoms, her current antidepressant treatment is not sufficient.\n\nDespite having noticeable pain, she rated her physical pain as being relatively low, suggesting that her emotional pain might be more significant than her physical pain at this time. This makes it less likely that an increase in her opioid pain medication (oxycodone) would benefit her emotional state. Oxycodone is for physical pain and not intended for treatment of depression.\n\nDextroamphetamine is a powerful stimulant and is not typically used as a first-line treatment for depression. It can have side effects like hypertension, increased heart rate, and potential for addiction, which would add more potential health problems for an already critically sick patient.\n\nReassurance alone, while always a part of good patient communication, is unlikely to be enough to significantly improve her symptoms of major depression.\n\nIt would be most important to assess for suicidal ideation given her ongoing depressive symptoms, recent worsening of mood, and the stress of a terminal illness. Patients with depression, particularly those with concurrent serious illnesses, have an elevated risk of suicide. Early detection of suicidal ideation allows for immediate intervention, as suicide is an preventable cause of death.\n\nHence, the answer is:\n(B) Assess for suicidal ideation.",

It is likely he has hypercalciuria, which is the most common metabolic abnormality detected in patients with calcium stone disease. \n\nTo manage it and avoid more stone formation, it is important to increase urine volume and reduce urine calcium concentration. Thiazide diuretics are often used for their effect of reducing renal tubular calcium reabsorption, which in turn decreases urinary calcium excretion. \n\nThiazide diuretics work by inhibiting the Na+ -Cl- symport in the distal tubule, reducing the reabsorption of Na+ and hence creating a negative sodium balance. This causes an increase in the reabsorption of calcium in the distal tubule by an unknown mechanism. The overall effect is a decrease in the excretion of calcium in the urine. \n\nCarbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as Acetazolamide, also increase urine volume, but they primarily affect bicarbonate excretion with no significant effect on calcium excretion. Na+ -K+ -2Cl- symport inhibitors, also known as loop diuretics, such as furosemide, increase calcium excretion, which can lead to more stone formation. Osmotic diuretics, such as mannitol, increase urine volume by maintaining a high solute concentration in the lumen of the nephron but it doesn't decrease calcium excretion.\n\nFrom the options provided, only the Na+ -Cl- symport inhibitor corresponds to the group of Thiazide diuretics which are the most appropriate treatment in this case.
