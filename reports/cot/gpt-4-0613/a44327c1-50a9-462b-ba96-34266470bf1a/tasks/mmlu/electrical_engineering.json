            "model_answer": "The Barkhausen stability criterion is a mathematical condition to determine when a linear electronic system with a feedback loop will oscillate. According to this criterion, an electronic oscillator will sustain steady oscillations only at frequencies for which:\n\n1. The gain in the loop is unity.\nThis means the magnitude of the product of the gains (amplifications) of all elements in the loop must equal 1. This is crucial because if the loop gain was less than unity, the signal would diminish with each pass around the feedback loop until it disappeared completely, and if it was greater than unity, the signal would increase indefinitely, resulting in instability or saturation. \n\n2. The phase shift around the loop is an integer multiple of 360\u00b0.\nThis means the total phase shift introduced by all elements in the loop must be such that the signal returns to its starting point in phase with its original state, ensuring that constructive interference is maintained with each pass around the loop.\n\nThis means both criteria A and C are correct, so the answer is D. \n\nSo, the answer is (D).",

            "model_answer": "A Potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider. In measurement systems, it can be used to calibrate the voltage.\n\nStep 1: Understanding the working principle of Potentiometer\nA potentiometer works on the principle of comparison. It compares the potential difference (voltage) of the circuit with that of an unknown source. When a perfect balance is achieved between the two voltages, the galvanometer will show zero deflection. This point is known as the null point.\n\nStep 2: Dissecting the options\nOption A and B talking about loading the circuit moderately and to the maximum extent respectively. But the key factor in the accuracy of a Potentiometer is not about how much it loads the circuit.\n\nOption C claims it uses a centre zero galvanometer instead of a voltmeter. While true that a galvanometer is used, this does not inherently make it more accurate than a voltmeter.\n\nOption D states that it does not load the circuit at all. The way a Potentiometer measures voltage is by balancing out an unknown voltage with a known one until there is no \"flow\" (i.e. zero current), and then determining the unknown voltage based on the known one. This means that it doesn't draw any current from the circuit while measuring, or in other words, it doesn't load the circuit at all.\n\nStep 3: Finalizing the conclusion\nGiven the above understanding about the potentiometer and the provided options, it is safe to say that the reason why a potentiometer is more accurate for DC voltage measurement is that it does not load the circuit at all. Hence option D is correct.\n\n(D)",

This value is ranged between 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 in the positive half cycle. \n\nThe counter emf (electromotive force) of 200 V, indicates the voltage drop across the circuit because of the reactive elements in the circuit (such as inductors and capacitors) and it is exactly equal to half of the amplitude of the source voltage, which is 400 V.\n\nIn single phase one pulse converter, each pulse of output current carries the reactive power to compensate the counter emf. As the output current for each pulse leads the applied voltage by 90\u00b0 for highly inductive load, when the counter emf is at highest or 200 V, the firing angle should be at least 90\u00b0.\n\nSo, the range of firing angle control is considered from this 90\u00b0 point to the maximum possible point in the positive half cycle which is 180\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is\n\n(D) 60\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.",
