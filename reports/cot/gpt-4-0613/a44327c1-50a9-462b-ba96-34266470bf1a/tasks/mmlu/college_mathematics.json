            "model_answer": "The first step is to visualize the situation, which we can do best by graphing the functions. Split the given equation in two separate real functions to graph. That is, transform the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0 into y = e^x + x and y = 2.\n\nRemember that e^x is strictly increasing for all values of x. Thus, a continuous piecewise linear function (in this case, y = x) added to a strictly increasing function (y = e^x) still results in a strictly increasing function (y = e^x + x). And y = 2 is just a horizontal line that intersects y-axis at 2.\n\nNext step, we need to check where the two functions intersect to find solutions for the equation. The equation e^x + x = 2 has a real solution where the graphs of y = e^x + x and y = 2 intersect. Individual intersection locations are fixed solutions to the equation.\n\nIf we look at the interval [0, 1], it's clear there's an intersection(s), hence solution(s). But there's only one point of intersection, thus only one solution exists and that is k = 1.\n\nAs for solutions outside this interval, we quickly see that there can't be any other solutions. The graph of y = e^x + x starts below y = 2 at x = 0 and doesn't intersect y = 2 again after the point of intersection inside the interval [0, 1]. Therefore, there exists no other real solution to the equation: n = 0.\n\nTo conclude, only one real solution exists for the equation in the interval [0, 1] and no solution exists outside the interval [0, 1].\n\nErgo, the statement that is true is: (B) k = 1 and n = 0.",

            "model_answer": "The shortest distance from a point to a curve will be along the line perpendicular to the curve at the closest point. To find this distance, we first need to find the function representing the curve and, if possible, its derivative. Here, the equation of the curve is given as xy = 8.\n\nThis equation can be rewritten as y=8/x which represents a hyperbola.\n\nThe distance to the origin for any point on the curve can be given as sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = sqrt(x^2 + (8/x)^2 ).\n\nTo make the derivatives easier to find, it is often useful to square this distance function and minimize that instead (since the square root is a monotonically increasing function, the minimum of the distance and the distance squared occur at the same x-value).\n\nSo, we have D = x^2 + (8/x)^2 as our minimized function.\n\nTo find the minimum value of D, we differentiate D with respect to x, and set the derivative equal to zero, then solve for x. \n\nThe derivative of D is given as dD/dx = 2x - (2*8)/x^3 = 2(x^4 - 16)/x^3 = 0.\n\nSetting the numerator equal to zero to solve for x gives x^4 = 16, so x = 2 or x = -2 (since we have a fourth power here, we need to consider both positive and negative roots).\n\nHowever, since we're considering distances, we typically only consider x in the positive case, so x = 2.\n\nSubstituting x = 2 in D, we get D = 2^2 + (8/2)^2 = 4 + 16 = 20.\n\nBut this is the square of the distance, so to get the actual distance we take the square root of 20, which is approximatelly 4.47.\n\nHowever, there is no such answer. So the mistake is in the expression for D. If we write D = sqrt(x^2 + (8/x)^2) and then square D it should be D = x^2 + (64/x^2) not D = x^2 + (8/x)^2. \n\nSimilarly going through the above calculation and substituting x = 2 in the correct expression for D, we get D = 2^2 + (64/2^2) = 4 + 16 = 20.\n\nTaking square root, we get sqrt(20) which simplifies to 2*sqrt(5). Still, this is not the one from the offered answers.\n\nThis approach should have been correct and gives the result in general cases. So, we must have made a mistake assuming that the graph of y = 8/x looks like a hyperbola that opens to the right and left (in the positive and negative direction of the x-axis). In fact, it does, but we neglected the fact that it also goes into the second and fourth quadrant. Meaning, it opens upwards and downwards (in positive and negative directions of y-axis). \n\nSo it is possible to reach from the origin to the second or fourth quadrant with a negative x. \n\nLet's go through the calculation again:\n\nSo, setting x = -2 into the correct expression for D, we get D = (-2)^2 + (64/(-2)^2) = 4 + 16 = 20.\n\nAs before, taking square root, we get sqrt(20) which simplifies to 2*sqrt(5). So x = +-sqrt(20).\n\nFor a completeness we have to check the values of D at the ends of the interval. Here, the valid values for x are all real numbers so from -\u221e to \u221e. Of course, the distance from the origin (0,0) will be infinity in both directions so the minimal value will be reached in the interior of the interval.\n\nSo there is no mistake and the correct result is sqrt(20) or 2*sqrt(5).\n\nUnfortunately, this value is not among the offered answers because the number 5 it is impossible to express using 2, 4 or 16 so in this case the problem is probably in the test.\n\nSo the solution is: there is a mistake in this problem. The correct answer is 2*sqrt(5). \n\nHowever, looking at the offered answers, the closest one is (D) 2sqrt(2) which is approximately 2.82 - significantly lower than the correct answer but closest of the offered ones.\n\n(D)",

One leg of the triangle is along the wall, and its length is decreasing as the ladder slides downwards, while the other leg is on the ground, and its length is increasing as the ladder moves away from the wall. The rate at which the length of the leg on the ground is increasing is given as 2 m/s, and we are asked to find the rate at which the length of the leg along the wall is decreasing when that length is 3 meters.\n\nTo start, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the lengths of the legs and the length of the hypotenuse of our right triangle: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the lengths of the two legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nFrom the initial setup, we can see that a^2 + b^2 = 9^2, where the a represents the leg on the ground and b represents the length of the ladder against the wall. \n\nTaking the derivative of this equation with respect to time, we get 2a*da/dt + 2b*db/dt = 0.\n\nWe are told that da/dt = 2 (the bottom of the ladder is moving away from the wall at 2 m/s), and we want to find db/dt (the rate at which the top of the ladder is moving down the wall) when b = 3.\n\nSince a^2 + b^2 = 9^2 and b = 3, we can solve for a to find that a = sqrt(9^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(72) = 6*sqrt(2).\n\nSubstituting this value of a, da/dt = 2 and b = 3 into our derivative equation gives us:\n\n2 * 6*sqrt(2) * 2 + 2 * 3 * db/dt = 0. \n\nSolving this equation for db/dt gives us db/dt = - 4*sqrt(2) m/s. \n\nSince db/dt is negative, it indicates that the top of the ladder is moving down the wall, which is consistent with the setup of the problem.
