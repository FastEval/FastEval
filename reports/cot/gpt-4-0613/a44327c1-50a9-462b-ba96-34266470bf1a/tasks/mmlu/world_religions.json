            "question": " What can murtis be translated as?\n\n(A) Offerings\n(B) Prayers\n(C) Apparitions\n(D) Idols",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "\"Murtis\" is a term that originates from Hinduism, a religion predominantly followed in India. It is used to denote a form or embodiment which the divine takes. In context, it is usually referred to the statues or images that are worshipped in Hindu temples.\n\nLet's break down the potential answers to see which one fits best:\n\n(A) Offerings: These usually refer to gifts or sacrifices made to the divine, which is not the same thing as a murti.\n\n(B) Prayers: These are conversations or petitions to the divine, also not in line with the concept of a murti.\n\n(C) Apparitions: While a murti could imaginatively be considered an 'apparition' in representing a divine form, this isn't the most accurate translation and can mislead because apparition usually suggests a ghostly figure or spontaneous manifestation which is far from the concept of a murti.\n\n(D) Idols: These are often physical objects that are worshipped, which aligns most closely to the concept of a murti.\n\nFrom the given options, \"Idols\" is the closest and most accurate translation to the term \"Murtis\".\n\nAnswer:\n(D) Idols",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "As the question suggests, it asks for a school of thought associated with \"Naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes\". \n\nThere are four options given: Daoism, Yin-Yang School, Mengzi, and Humanistic Buddhism.\n\n(A) Daoism or Taoism: This is a philosophical and religious tradition of China that emphasizes living in harmony with the Dao. The Dao, in Daoist belief, is the absolute principle underlying the universe, combining within itself the principles of Yin and Yang and signifying the 'way', or code of behavior. This focuses on living in harmony with nature.\n\n(B) Yin-Yang School: This is a Chinese school of philosophy that believes in the complementary nature of opposites, and that balance between these is necessary for harmony. It does tend to look at natural processes, but it doesn't necessarily focus just on natural elements.\n\n(C) Mengzi: Mengzi was a philosopher who focused on the teachings of Confucius and is most known for promoting humanity and righteousness as essential for good governance and peace in society, rather than on natural elements and processes.\n\n(D) Humanistic Buddhism: This is a modern movement in Buddhism that seeks to connect the religious teachings with everyday life. Its focus is more on human life and human issues, and not mainly with natural elements and processes.\n\nLooking at all four, it points more surely towards Daoism, which is known for its emphasis on harmony with nature, and could be regarded as a concentration on natural elements and processes.\n\nThe answer is (A) Daoism.",

            "model_answer": "The Mi'raj refers to a specific event in the life of the Prophet Muhammad, as per Islamic belief. It isn't Muhammad's migration to Mecca, which is known as the Hijrah. Therefore, option (B) is not the correct answer. \n\nMoreover, it is not about the first community in Mecca as well. The Prophet Muhammad\u2019s first community was actually established in Medina, not Mecca, and it doesn't have anything specific to do with the concept of Mi'raj. Thus, option (C) is incorrect. \n\nAlso, it doesn't refer to Muhammad's revelations of the Qur'an. Those revelations are simply referred to as the revelations or the divine messages he received during his prophethood, not the Mi'raj. So, option (D) is not right as well. \n\nThe Mi'raj refers to a miraculous journey Muhammad took in one night from Mecca to Jerusalem and then ascended to the heavens. There, he had a meeting with Allah (God), after passing through the different levels of heaven and encountering various prophets along the way. It is told that during this journey, Muhammad was given the command of five daily prayers for Muslims. This option corresponds to (A) Muhammad's miraculous ascent to heaven. \n\nSo, the correct answer is (A) Muhammad's miraculous ascent to heaven.",
