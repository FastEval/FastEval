            "model_answer": "A disjunctive syllogism is a type of logical argument that presents two or more alternative options in the major premise, and then eliminates all but one in the minor premise, leading to a conclusion. \n\nThe major premise normally proposes two alternatives in the form \"Either A is true or B is true\". \n\nThe minor premise then eliminates one of these options (usually in the form \"A is not true\") \n\nThe conclusion then asserts the truth of the remaining option (\"Therefore, B is true\").\n\nFurthermore, the major premise in a disjunctive syllogism does not classify subjects, nor does it affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent (those are related to other types of syllogisms or logical arguments). It also doesn't inherently lead to a valid conclusion \u2014 that depends on the correctness of the minor premise and whether the argument adheres to the rules of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nBased on this, the best answer is (A) which states that the major premise includes two or more alternatives.\n\n(A) includes two or more alternatives.",

            "model_answer": "The fallacy of style over substance refers to situations where presentation or how an argument is made seems to be given more importance than the actual content or point of the argument itself. This fallacy occurs when an observer is misled into thinking an argument is better because it looks or sounds better, rather than based on substantive, factual, or logic-based reasons.\n\n(A) Changing the meaning of a word or phrase from one part of the argument to another: This is not the definition of style over substance. This description refers to another type of fallacy known as 'equivocation'.\n\n(B) Confusing figurative language with literal language: Although this can sometimes contribute to the style over substance fallacy, it isn't the definition. This description might be related to a comprehension or interpretation issue, rather than the aforementioned fallacy.\n\n(D) Using emotionally charged language to create an impression about the subject of a claim, without making an argument that the language fits the subject: This is more closely related to emotive language or appeal to emotion fallacy.\n\n(C) Reasoning that ideas presented in an appealing manner are correct, regardless of the content of the message: This definition aligns with the fallacy of style over substance since it underlines the tendency of privileging the way the message is communicated over the actual content of the message.\n\nHence, the answer is (C) Reasoning that ideas presented in an appealing manner are correct, regardless of the content of the message.",

This is not related to suppressing evidence or discrediting a source.\n\n(C) Poisoning the well - This fallacy consists of any attempt to dismiss or discredit the validity of a source by preemptively presenting adverse information about the source, with the intention to make the audience skeptical of the source\u2019s claims. This closely matches the description given in the question. \n\n(D) Appeal to anonymous authority - It is a fallacy where an unspecified source is used as evidence for a claim. This is not about discrediting a source, but instead about wrongly attributing authority.\n\nGiven these definitions, the only fallacy that matches the one given in the question is (C) Poisoning the well, which attempts to suppress evidence by claiming a flaw in the source, even when there is no direct relationship between this alleged flaw and the reliability of the source.\n\nThe final answer is clear:\n\n(C)",
