            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's define some terms:\n\n1. The \"coastal State\" refers to the country whose coastline is nearest to the location of the vessel.\n2. The \"flag State\" refers to the country under which the vessel is registered.\n3. \"All States enjoy such jurisdiction\" suggests global or international jurisdiction.\n4. The \"International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea\" is a court related to maritime disputes.\n\nThe jurisdiction of crimes committed onboard vessels is mostly governed by the principle of flag state jurisdiction. This principle is recognized under international law and specifically mentioned in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). According to this principle, the country in which a vessel is registered (the flag state) holds jurisdiction over that vessel, regardless of its location.\n\nSo, we can conclude that the choice that fits best with the principle above is the one that refers to the flag state. \n\nThus, the answer is:\n(B) The flag State",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Justiciability refers to a concept in constitutional law which is primarily concerned with the ability of a court to review and make a judgment on different issues. The concept of justiciability is largely used by courts to avoid stepping into situations that are more appropriately handled by other branches of the government. Essentially, it is about whether a court should, rather than could, take up a case.\n\nOption (A) refers to enforcement but justiciability is not about the possibility of enforcement of a right, but about whether a court should examine a matter. Therefore, this option is not correct.\nOption (B) talks about the 'just nature' of a right. Justiciability, however, does not concern about the just nature or cause of a right, as this seems to suggest ethical or moral implications, which are not the focus of justiciability.\nOption (C) involves non-enforcement of rights and justice principles, but this is not what justiciability is about. It's about the appropriateness of court intervention, not the justice of non-enforcement.\nOption (D) talks about a State's obligation to enforce a right, which is not the subject of justiciability. \n\nTherefore, none of the provided answers correctly reflect the meaning of justiciability, as it primarily refers to the suitability or appropriateness of an issue for judicial review.",

            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention are concepts in international relations and humanitarian law that relate to the obligations of the international community and states toward civilian populations when there's threat of mass atrocities such as genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing.\n\nIn principle, R2P is not the same as humanitarian intervention. Although both share the same objective of preventing mass atrocities, the principles that guide how they are applied and their scope of implementation are different. Therefore, option (A) can be ruled out.\n\nOption (B) suggests that R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress. While this is sometimes the case, it is not a defining characteristic of R2P. R2P can be invoked even without the consent of the state in question if the state is unwilling or unable to halt or avert the said atrocities. So, statement (B) is not a valid difference.\n\nOption (D) states that R2P always involves the use of armed force, but this is not accurate. R2P is a three-pillar principle that includes the responsibility to prevent, to react, and to rebuild. Armed force (the responsibility to react) is the last resort and is not always involved. Hence, (D) can be dismissed.\n\nOn the other hand, R2P has a mandate for implementation through the United Nations Security Council, which provides a procedural framework for its application. This also includes an evaluation of whether other peaceful means have been exhausted before resorting to the use of force. This makes R2P less arbitrary and gives the international community a structured and legal route to intervene in crises situations. This matches with option (C), which states that R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\nTherefore, the best answer that describes a distinctive difference between R2P and humanitarian intervention is:\n\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The 'Lotus principle' is a principle originated from a judgment by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Lotus Case (France v. Turkey). This case was related to a collision of French and Turkish ships on high seas. The central focus of the case was the concept of jurisdiction in international law. The ICJ held that the first and foremost restriction imposed by international law upon a State is that - failing the existence of a permissive rule to the contrary - it may not exercise its power in any form in the territory of another State. So, basically, the idea is that unless there's a rule that specifically prohibits it, anything is fair game in international law.\n\nLet's now see which of the options best fits this principle:\n\n(A) The so-called Lotus principle is that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', or, as it has been construed, 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law'. This option seems to perfectly encapsulate the principle which emerged from the Lotus case, as it emphasizes the idea that anything not explicitly prohibited is allowed in international law. \n\n(B) The so-called Lotus principle is that States are free to choose the Court that they will submit their disputes. The Lotus principle doesn't primarily discuss about the freedom of the states to choose the court for their disputes. Hence, this can not be a correct option.\n\n(C) The so-called Lotus principle is that States are not prohibited to assert their enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas. While the Lotus case was indeed related to an incident that took place on the high seas, this option doesn't fully capture the broad and foundational implications of the Lotus principle in international law.\n\n(D) The so-called Lotus principle is that customary law derives from the combination of State practice and opinio juris. This option seems to discuss about how customary international law is made, rather than the Lotus principle.\n\nAfter careful consideration of the options, it is clear that option A most accurately reflects the Lotus principle as it emerged from the Lotus case.\n\n(A)",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The UK Constitution is unique in that it is not codified. This means that unlike countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom does not have a single, written document that forms the constitution. Instead, it is made up of a number of sources such as Acts of Parliament, court judgments, conventions, and works of authority. This is a fact widely recognized by constitutional experts and scholars. \n\nOption A is incorrect as the sovereign (monarch) does not hold all the power according to the UK Constitution. The UK is a constitutional monarchy whereby the Queen's role is largely ceremonial and the true power rests with the Parliament, particularly the House of Commons.\n\nOption B is also incorrect. In the United Kingdom, we have something called parliamentary supremacy or parliamentary sovereignty. This means that Parliament is the supreme legal authority and can create or end any law. The courts cannot overrule its legislation and no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change.\n\nOption D is incorrect because although the Bill of Rights of 1689 is an important document in the UK constitutional history, it's not the sole basis of the UK Constitution, which is instead derived from a range of sources.\n\nGiven our above analysis, the most accurate statement is:\n\n(C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources.",

            "model_answer": "The obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes is a principle in international law that mandates states to resolve their disputes through peaceful means. This, however, does not imply that states are under a strict obligation to resolve their disputes. Instead, they are required to pursue peaceful means of dispute resolution, such as negotiation, mediation, arbitration, or adjudication before international courts or tribunals. Hence, the obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes can best be described as an obligation of conduct.\n\nThis obligation does not only concern international courts and tribunals, it is a general obligation for all states involved in a dispute. Therefore, the claim that it is an obligation that solely concerns international courts and tribunals is incorrect.\n\nFurthermore, while peaceful settlement of disputes is indeed a fundamental principle of international law, it is not a peremptory norm, also known as jus cogens. A peremptory norm is a fundamental principle that is accepted by the international community of states as a norm from which no derogation is permitted. \n\nTherefore, the obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes is not an obligation of result, it is not a peremptory norm, and it is not an obligation that solely concerns international courts and tribunals. It is an obligation of conduct, that is, states are only required to make genuine efforts towards peaceful resolution of disputes as opposed to being obligated to achieve a resolution.\n\n(B) It is an obligation of conduct, ie States have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means.

Even though the composition of the committee hearing admissibility cases was changed from three judges to one judge. So, this statement is true.\n\n(B) Protocol 14 also added a new criterion for admissibility.

So, this statement is also true.\n\n(D) The Protocol 14, however, did not extend the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights.

The size of the landform does not determine its classification.\n\nOption (B): According to UNCLOS, islands are entitled to their own territorial waters, contiguous zone, and exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Therefore, the statement that rocks do not have any maritime zone cannot be correct.\n\nOption (C): The definition provided in this option aligns with the UNCLOS. Article 121 (3) of the convention stipulates, \"Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf\". This essentially differentiates 'rocks' from 'islands', with the latter being capable of sustaining human life or having an economic life of its own.\n\nOption (D): The ability to sustain human habitation would categorize the landform as an 'island', not a 'rock', according to UNCLOS.\n\nGiven these explanations, it's clear option (C) most accurately reflects the definition of a 'rock' as per UNCLOS.\n\nSo, the answer is (C).",
