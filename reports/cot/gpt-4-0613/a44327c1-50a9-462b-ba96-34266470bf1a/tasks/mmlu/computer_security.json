            "model_answer": "In order to understand which style of fuzzer is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in a program, one needs to understand each of the styles mentioned.\n\n(A) Generational fuzzing involves the generation of test data without any knowledge of the structure of the input. It's random and has no knowledge of the software under test.\n\n(B) Blackbox fuzzing is also referred to as specification-based fuzzing or protocol fuzzing. The fuzzer generates inputs without any knowledge of the internal workings of the system.\n\n(C) Whitebox fuzzing, on the other hand, has complete visibility into the target program's control flow, data flow, and other internal structures. It can generate inputs that can cover all paths in the software thus increasing code coverage.\n\n(D) Finally, mutation-based fuzzing involves creating new inputs by modifying existing inputs.\n\nGiven that whitebox fuzzing has complete visibility into the control flow and internal structure of the software under test, it stands out as the fuzzer that would most likely be able to explore paths covering every line of code in a program. Whitebox fuzzers can systematically explore each combination of paths through the software, thus ensuring complete or near-complete code coverage.\n\n(C) Whitebox",

            "question": "Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don\u2019t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.\n2. An attacker impersonating the server.\n\n(A) True, True\n(B) False, False\n(C) True, False\n(D) False, True",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol provides secure communication between a client and a server over the internet. \n\nAbout the first statement, \"An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier\". One of the key features of TLS is the prevention of replay attacks. During the handshake process, a unique session ID is created with associated session keys. If an attacker tries to replay bytes that a client sent earlier, TLS will not recognize them as coming from the active session, because they do not match the session keys associated with that ID. So, the first statement is true.\n\nIn regards to the second statement, \"An attacker impersonating the server\", TLS also takes care of this using its certificate verification process. When establishing a connection, the client verifies the identity of the server using the server's certificate. This certificate contains the server's public key and is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The client has a list of trusted CAs and uses this to verify the authenticity of the server's certificate. So it's impossible for an attacker to impersonate the server without having access to the server's private key, which is assumed to be safe according to the problem statement. Therefore, the second statement is also True.\n\nSo in conclusion, TLS does protect against both \"An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier\" and \"An attacker impersonating the server\".\n\nSo looking at the options given, the correct answer is: \n\n(A) True, True",

What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The Kerberos protocol guarantees the security of client-server connections in a local network. The main part of this protocol is a ticket, that the client gets from the Kerberos Server (KDC). This ticket, once obtained by a client, is used further to authenticate the client to various services. Once the ticket is issued, it remains valid until its \"expiration period\". \n\nAccording to the question, this period or the maximum lifetime of a ticket for the MIT\u2019s Kerberos KDC server is 24 hours. After this period, the client needs to request a new ticket. This leads us to address what specifically stops an expired ticket from being used further.\n\nLooking at the given options:\n\n(A) Indicates that the KDC refuses to establish new connections. This doesn\u2019t specifically talks about the mechanism on the existing connections and only focuses on the new ones to be established. \n\n(B) Mentions a 24-hour timer that the server sets to terminate the connection. This suggests that the termination occurs regardless of whether the client is actively using the service or not, which could be problematic. Also, this does not align with the protocol\u2019s mechanism. \n\n(C) Signifies that the server checks the expiration time of the client's ticket against its current time during connection and authentication process. This fits with the general understanding of the Kerberos mechanism.\n\n(D) Implies that the server sends a query to KDC to confirm ticket validity. However, in the Kerberos protocol, the server doesn\u2019t generally query the KDC every time it needs to authenticate a client. \n\nGiven this information, we can infer that option (C): \u201cWhen a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket\u2019s expiration time is in the past.\" is the closest to how the Kerberos authentication protocol works.\n\n(C)",

Ben Bitdiddle notes that NaCl uses Intel x86 segmentation to ensure that the sandboxed module does not read or write memory outside its own data area, and does not execute instructions outside its own code. Ben thinks that with these restrictions alone, executing the sandboxed module must be safe; that is, he thinks validation is not needed. Ben is wrong. Circle the types of x86 machine instructions that the validator always forbids in sandboxed code. Please ignore trampoline and springboard code.\n\n(A) all instructions that modify segment state\n(B) all loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32\n(C) all indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable)\n(D) all indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable)",

            "model_answer": "Ben might seem correct at first, but it's important to realize that even if the memory segmentation is protected, there are still several instructions that can pose potential risks and therefore need to be validated. Let's examine each option one by one:\n\n(A) all instructions that modify segment state\nIntel x86 segmentation provides a way to isolate the memory space of the untrusted, sandboxed code from the host system's code. Any instructions that can modify this segment state can potentially break the isolation, providing a way for the sandboxed code to affect the host system's code. Therefore, these instructions are forbidden and need to be validated to ensure that they are not misused.\n\n(B) all loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32\nMisalignment can potentially cause problems, but it's not inherently dangerous, and therefore not always forbidden. \n\n(C) all indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable)\nIndirect loads or stores might seem risky, but as long as NaCl can validate that all pointers are in-bounds during the compile/load time, these instructions aren't necessarily forbidden. \n\n(D) all indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable)\nIndirect jumps can be dangerous. They can allow for code to \"jump\" to any memory location, including those containing malicious instructions. This makes it necessary for these types of instructions to also be validated to ensure safety. \n\nIt is important to note that the Native Client (NaCl) can prevent this potentially malicious behavior by validating that the target of a jump or a branch is safe and that the target instruction is correctly aligned.\n\nNow let's consider the options again\n\n(A) all instructions that modify segment state\n(D) all indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable)\n\nIn essence, the security of the system relies heavily on the strictness of validation.
