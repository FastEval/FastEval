            "question": "A lesion causing compression of the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen will cause ipsilateral\n\n(A) paralysis of the facial muscles.\n(B) paralysis of the facial muscles and loss of taste.\n(C) paralysis of the facial muscles, loss of taste and lacrimation.\n(D) paralysis of the facial muscles, loss of taste, lacrimation and decreased salivation.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The stylomastoid foramen is the exit point for the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) from the skull. This nerve is responsible for several actions including motor innervation of the muscles of facial expression, providing taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, stimulating the lacrimal and salivary glands, and even carrying some sensory information from the external ear.\n\nIf the facial nerve is compressed at the stylomastoid foramen, it would disrupt all of these functions. This means that there would be paralysis of the muscles on the same side of the face as the lesion (ipsilateral). Along with facial muscle paralysis, we can expect to have loss of taste on the same side of the lesion because facial nerve carries taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. In addition, since the lacrimal and the salivary glands are also innervated by the facial nerve, their regular functions would be affected on the side of the lesion causing decreased lacrimation and decreased salivation.\n\nSo, lets compare our deduction with the given options:\n(A) paralysis of the facial muscles. - This statement is correct, but neglects the other impairments that would result from damage to the facial nerve.\n(B) paralysis of the facial muscles and loss of taste. - This statement adds the loss of taste to the effects, but still neglects the impact on lacrimation and salivation.\n(C) paralysis of the facial muscles, loss of taste and lacrimation. - This statement further adds decreased lacrimation but neglects decreased salivation.\n(D) paralysis of the facial muscles, loss of taste, lacrimation and decreased salivation. - This statement includes all the possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the most accurate answer here would be:\n(D) paralysis of the facial muscles, loss of taste, lacrimation and decreased salivation.",

            "question": "A \"dished face\" profile is often associated with\n\n(A) a protruding mandible due to reactivation of the condylar cartilage by acromegaly.\n(B) a recessive maxilla due to failure of elongation of the cranial base.\n(C) an enlarged frontal bone due to hydrocephaly.\n(D) defective development of the maxillary air sinus.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The term \"dished face\" profile generally refers to a facial contour where the middle portion of the face appears to be slightly concave or 'sunken' compared to the forehead and lower jaw. It is primarily associated with maldevelopment of the maxilla, or upper jaw. This description corresponds with the anatomical abnormality described in option B, which suggests that a retracted or recessive maxilla is the result of failure of elongation of the cranial base. \n\nOption A is incorrect because acromegaly tends to cause an enlarged or protruding jaw (prognathism), not a dished face. Option C is incorrect because hydrocephaly often enlarges the entire skull rather than causing a dished face specifically. Option D is incorrect because defective development of the maxillary air sinus may cause facial asymmetry or other complications, but it doesn't directly cause a dished face profile as described.\n\nSo, B is the correct answer since it corresponds with the condition that would cause a dished face profile, which is a recessive maxilla.\n\n(B)",

They originate from the neural crest, which is a transient group of cells unique to vertebrates that gives rise to various body structures, including melanocytes.\n\n(D) Sweat glands: Sweat glands are derivatives from the ectodermal layer but not specifically from ectomesenchyme.\n\nFrom the given options, ectomesenchyme is involved in the formation of melanocytes.

Nephrons are the structural and functional units of a kidney that cleanse the blood and balance the constituents of the circulation. \n\nOption (A), afferent arteriole, is the initial blood-vessel segment of the renal circulation that brings blood into the kidney and each nephron but it is not the cluster of capillaries itself.\n\nOption (C), Loop of Henle, is a part of the nephron that affects the concentration of urine using a countercurrent mechanism. It is not a cluster of blood capillaries.\n\nOption (D), the renal pelvis, is a funnel-shaped space in the kidney that accepts urine from the kidney tissues and passes it along to the ureter and then the bladder. It doesn't contain a cluster of blood capillaries.\n\nOn the other hand, option (B), glomerulus, is an accurate description of what the question is asking for. The glomerulus is a network, or tuft, of capillaries located at the beginning of a nephron in the kidney. The glomerulus is the part of the kidney where blood is initially filtered to form urine.  \n\nSo, the cluster of blood capillaries found in each nephron in the kidney is the glomerulus.\n\n(B) Glomerulus",

If the spinal cord injury affects anything below this level, it could impact their ability to breathe. That's because the control of the diaphragm, which is essential for breathing, is located around the cervical spinal nerves from level C3 to C5.\n\nTherefore, a person with damage at level C6 could potentially still have control over their diaphragm and breathing, assuming the injury doesn't extend beyond that level.\n\nBased on the information provided, the patient would not necessarily require life support for breathing (eliminating choice A), and it is not predictable without more information, that the patient would only be able to breathe quietly (eliminating choice B). It's also not accurate to say the breathing will be unaffected because damage to the spinal cord can cause some kind of respiratory distress (eliminating choice D).

The mucus can trap bacteria and other pathogens, and the cells of the membranes can often produce defensive substances that help kill pathogens.\n\n(C) Osteoblasts are cells that are involved in bone formation.

Prior to the eighth week, the face is more flat-structured and the upper and lower jaw structures have just begun to form from their respective processes.\n\nBy the eighth week, all these processes and structures have grown and moved enough to begin the complex process of fusion to form the mature structures of the facial skeleton, including, among other things, the palatine processes beginning to fuse to form the hard palate.\n\nSo, by referencing established knowledge on embryonic development, we can confidently say:\n\n(B) eight weeks post-fertilization.",
