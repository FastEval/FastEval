            "model_answer": "The prevalence of a disease in a population is determined by two factors: the number of new cases (incidence rate) and the duration of the disease (survival time after disease onset or time till recovery).\n\nA) If the incidence rate of the disease falls, this would mean fewer new cases of the disease are being recorded. This would lead to a decrease, not an increase, in disease prevalence.\n\nB) If survival time with the disease increases, more people will be living with the disease for longer periods of time. This would increase the disease prevalence.\n\nC) If recovery of the disease is faster, this would mean people are clearing the disease from their system more quickly. Therefore, at any given time, fewer people would have the disease, leading to a decrease in disease prevalence.\n\nD) If the population in which the disease is measured increases, this may or may not change the prevalence depending on the incidence rate within the new population members. If everything else remains the same, prevalence would not necessarily increase as it is a measure of proportion of affected individuals in the population rather than a total count.\n\nTherefore, the only circumstance that would likely cause an increase in disease prevalence is (B) If survival time with the disease increases. \n\nAnswer: (B)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this, we need to understand the basic definitions and characteristics of flavonoids, isoflavonoids, carotenoids, and polyphenols. \n\nStatement (A) says the flavonoid class comprises flavonoids and isoflavonoids. Flavonoids are indeed a large class of plant pigments that play vital roles in plant growth and health. Isoflavonoids are a type of flavonoid, so they belong to the flavonoid class. Therefore, statement (A) is correct.\n\nStatement (B) claims that the digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones in soya food products are not impacted by processing. This statement is incorrect, research has shown that the digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones can be altered by food processing methods such as fermentation and heating.\n\nStatement (C) says that \u00df-Carotene and lycopene can both act as provitamin A. Provitamin A is a term that refers to compounds that the body can convert into active vitamin A. \u00df-Carotene is indeed a precursor to vitamin A, but lycopene is not. It's an antioxidant that can help protect against cancer and heart disease. So, statement (C) is not correct.\n\nStatement (D) states that carotenoids and flavonoids both belong to the polyphenol class. This is also incorrect. While flavonoids are a subclass of polyphenols, carotenoids are a completely different class of compounds. Flavonoids have a similar arrangement of carbon atoms, but carotenoids - which include substances like beta-carotene and lycopene - do not not have this structure and have their own distinct classification.\n\nWith these evaluations, the correct statement is:\n\n(A) The flavonoid class comprises flavonoids and isoflavonoids.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To evaluate the main causes of the obesity epidemic, we can examine what multiple studies have identified on the topic.\n\nOption C suggests the cause is changes in genetic profiles. Whilst it is true that genetics can play a part in obesity, our genes have not changed significantly in the time frame that obesity has become such a worldwide issue. It's more likely environmental changes and lifestyle factors have played a larger role in this. \n\nOption A first suggests an increase in energy quantity/density in our diet. Over the past few decades, there has been a significant rise in the availability and uptake of energy-dense, highly processed foods. These are foods that provide a lot of energy and calories but have little to no nutritional value. Many of these foods also encourage overeating, as they're often not very filling despite being high in calories.\n\nThis option also ties into a sedentary lifestyle. Sedentary behavior is another environmental change and significant factor contributing to the obesity epidemic. Many jobs now involve sitting at a desk for many hours, with little need for physical exertion. Similarly, leisure time is often spent in a sedentary behavior such as watching television or playing video games.\n\nOption B suggests that a decrease in leisure time activity is the cause. This is, in part, related to the latter point of Option A as it refers to less physical activity overall. However, the phrasing of this option suggests that the problem solely resides with our leisure time, missing the pervasive role of sedentary work lifestyle. \n\nIn summary, although obesity is a complex problem involving multiple factors, the main causes can likely be boiled down to the two points covered in Option A: increased energy density in our diet and a more sedentary lifestyle. \n\nHence, the answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The question asks about a vitamin that is a major lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes. This means we need to look for a vitamin that can dissolve in lipids (fats) and that has antioxidant properties. \n\nThe options provided are Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K.\n\nVitamin A (retinol) is important for growth, the immune system and vision. Although it is lipid-soluble, it is not the predominant antioxidant in cell membranes.\n\nVitamin D (cholecalciferol) is important for maintaining blood levels of calcium and phosphate and for bone health. Although it is also lipid-soluble, it isn't known for its antioxidant properties.\n\nVitamin K plays a vital role in blood clotting and maintaining strong bones. However, it has not been identified as the major antioxidant in human cell membranes.\n\nVitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols) is a term that refers to a group of compounds that have similar physiological effects. Importantly, they have been recognized for their strong antioxidant properties and are lipid-soluble. Vitamin E safeguards cell membranes from the damage caused by free radicals and reactive oxygen species, typical by-products of metabolism in cells.\n\nHence, according to the properties of vitamin E, it seems to be the correct answer.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) Vitamin E.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Vitamin B12 absorption and metabolism is a complex process that involves multiple organs and systems in the body. \n\n(A) Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor: Intrinsic factor, secreted by the stomach, is prerequisite for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the ileum. Therefore, reduced secretion of this factor will directly contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency. \n\n(B) Atrophic gastritis: It is a chronic inflammation of the stomach mucosa leading to loss of gastric glandular cells and their eventual replacement by intestinal and fibrous tissues. This condition results in reduced secretion of stomach acid needed for releasing B12 from food, and hence, it contributes to vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n(C) Helicobacter pylori infection: These bacteria have been associated with numerous gastric conditions including gastritis and peptic ulcers, both of which can interfere with vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nSo, putting all these together, we can conclude that all of these factors mentioned can contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the connection between obesity, hormones, and endometrial cancer. \n\nThe endometrium is a lining of the uterus which grows and sheds during each menstrual cycle in response to the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Endometrial cancer commonly occurs due to an imbalance of these hormones. \n\nIn obese women, fat tissue converts other hormones into estrogen. This excessive estrogen can cause a growth of the endometrial lining, which in time could lead to endometrial cancer. In women after menopause, the primary source of estrogen is the fat tissue. Hence, an obese woman is exposed to more estrogen which is hypothesized to be the underlying cause for the increased risk for endometrial cancer. \n   \nTherefore, the hormone that is thought to mediate the effect obesity has on increasing the risk of endometrial cancer is estrogen.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B) Oestrogen.",

            "model_answer": "Let's examine these answer choices one by one.\n\n(A) The metabolic demand is supplied only from the diet. This is incorrect. While diet is a significant source of amino acids, it's not the only source. The body also produces some amino acids internally.\n\n(B) The metabolic demand is to maintain protein turnover. This statement could be partly true, as amino acids are certainly used to produce proteins via protein synthesis. However, this is not the entire picture, as amino acids also have other important metabolic functions.\n\n(C) The metabolic demand involves consumption of amino-acids by a number of irreversible pathways and these are either obligatory or adaptive. This is true. Amino acids are used in a variety of metabolic processes, some of which are irreversible. Some of these pathways are \"obligatory,\" meaning they always occur, while others are \"adaptive,\" meaning they can be turned on or off as needed.\n\n(D) The metabolic demand is a fixed amount. This is incorrect. The metabolic demand for amino acids can fluctify based on factors like diet, stress, and illness.\n\nSo out of all the choices, option (C) seems to capture the complexity and adaptability of the body's demand for amino acids.\n\n(C)",
