            "model_answer": "1. To find out the correct answer, a review of recent scientific literature about polyomaviruses in humans is required. Polyomaviruses are a type of virus that can infect and replicate within animals and humans.\n\n2. Polyomaviruses were first discovered around half a century ago. The first known human polyomavirus was the BK virus, named after the patient from whom it was first isolated. Shortly thereafter, a second polyomavirus, the JC virus, was identified. For a long time, BK and JC were the only known human polyomaviruses. \n\n3. However, with advances in molecular biology and genomics, several more human polyomaviruses have been identified in the last two decades. As of now, the number of known human polyomaviruses is in the low double figures. \n\n4. It should be noted that scientific knowledge is always expanding and new discoveries are being made continuously. Therefore, the number of human polyomaviruses known to the scientific community is subject to change with future research. \n\nWith that being said, as of the most recent scientific literature, the answer would be:\n\n(C) 10",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "AIDS activism in the United States had a profound impact on the country, particularly in the realm of medicine and public health. \n\nLet's break down each of the potential answers:\n\n(A) Food and Drug Administration reforms: Throughout the 1980s and \u201890s, AIDS activists intensely lobbied the FDA for changes in the process of drug approval. This led to the implementation of more accelerated approval processes, specifically for medications related to life-threatening diseases such as AIDS. This ultimately resulted in significant reforms in the FDA. \n\n(B) Easier access to investigational drugs: AIDS activism drove the need for patients to have access to experimental drugs. This was due to the urgency of finding effective treatments when there were limited options available. In 1987, the FDA set up a program to make experimental drugs available to patients with serious illnesses faster, which was largely a result of AIDS activism.\n\n(C) Changes in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S.: The AIDS epidemic triggered a shift in how patients and doctors interacted. Patients wanted to take a more active role in their care and were no longer content to be passive recipients of doctor\u2019s orders. This lead to more informed consent, shared decision-making between doctors and patients, and the concept of patient autonomy got more importance.\n\nSo, looking at each of these choices, one can see that indeed, each occurred as a result of AIDS activism. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) All of the above.",

            "question": "Globally, the most deaths are caused by:\n\n(A) Respiratory infections\n(B) Diarrheal diseases\n(C) Malaria\n(D) Tuberculosis",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we would have to look at the global mortality statistics provided by credible health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These organizations regularly publish up-to-date data regarding the leading causes of deaths worldwide.\n\nThe four options given here are all infectious diseases, which can definitely cause significant mortality. Here's a quick look at each one:\n\n(A) Respiratory infections are a broad category of diseases. This includes influenza, pneumonia and other acute lower respiratory infections. As per WHO statistics, they are quite lethal and a leading cause of death.\n\n(B) Diarrheal diseases, usually linked to poor sanitation and contaminated drinking water, also contribute to a high number of deaths globally especially in low-income countries.\n\n(C) Malaria, a mosquito-borne infectious disease, is deadly and prevalent in tropical regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet the number of deaths caused by malaria, while still high, is lower than those caused by respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases.\n\n(D) Tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs, is also a leading cause of death worldwide. However, globally the number of deaths from TB is less than respiratory infections.\n\nBy analyzing data from WHO, we can see that, among the options given, respiratory infections kill the most people worldwide. Then we can conclude that the cause of most deaths globally among the given options is respiratory infections.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Respiratory infections.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The 'incubation period' is the period between exposure to an infection and the appearance of the first symptoms. During this time, the infectious agent, such as a virus, is entering the body, being carried to target cells, and THEN multiplying in the infected cells. The length of the incubation period depends on the specific virus or infectious agent; it can range from a few hours to a few weeks, but in many cases it is a few days.\n\n(A) is incorrect because the immune system does not clear the virus from the body during the incubation period. on the contrary, the infection is just setting in.\n\n(B) is accurate, as virus replication indeed happens at an intracellular level during this period. \n\n(C) is generally true, but it's not universally true for all viruses or infectious agents.\n\n(D) is incorrect, as in many cases the incubation period lasts more than just a few hours.\n\nSo, considering the most comprehensive and universally accurate statement regarding the incubation period would be that during this period, the virus multiplies at an intracellular level.\n\n(B) Virus replication happens at an intracellular level.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking about the best feeding approach for newborn infants in countries with limited access to safe water and low levels of education.\n\n(A) If the infant is exclusively formula-fed for six months, there are several concerns. The first is the water used to make the formula. In countries with limited access to safe water, there is a high risk of the water being contaminated, putting the baby at risk of developing infectious diseases. Also, formula requires education to correctly prepare and safely store which may not be possible in areas with low levels of education.\n\n(C) & (D) Also have similar problems as (A) if other foods are introduced too early, proper hygiene can't be ensured. \n\n(B) Exclusive breastfeeding for six months is recommended by the World Health Organization as the best feeding option for newborns worldwide. The reason is that breast milk not only provides all the nutrients needed by a newborn, but also includes antibodies that can help protect the child from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia which are leading causes of child mortality in developing countries. In addition, breastfeeding requires no additional water and thus does not put the infant at risk of water-born diseases.\n\nSo the answer is (B) Exclusively breast fed for six months.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider which segment of society is most influential in achieving effective change in a community.\n\n(A) Innovators: While innovators are crucial in creating new ideas and solutions, they represent a small percentage of society and often face resistance to their unproven ideas. Thus, they may not be the most effective in creating community-wide change.\n\n(B) Early adapters: Early adopters are those who are willing to try new ideas after the innovators. They are often respected by their peers and can help persuade others to adopt new changes as well. This may be where change begins to take effect on a larger scale.\n\n(C) Middle adapters: The middle majority often wait to adopt new ideas until they have been tested by early adopters. They represent a large portion of society, so their participation is vital to widespread change. At the same time, they need persuasion and proof that the change is beneficial before they will adopt it.\n\n(D) Late adapters: Late adopters are the last to embrace change, often only doing so after it has become the norm among other societal members. By their very nature, they are not catalysts for change, but followers.\n\nGiven these assessments, middle adapters are most essential to creating effective change as they represent a large proportion of society and are where the mass of people begin to adopt change. Likewise, early adapters can also have influence as they are the ones who are willing to try new changes and are often respected by their peers. \n\nBut between early adapters and middle adapters, the latter, representing a higher proportion of society, can be more responsible for creating an effective change since greater participation is instrumental to scale the change.\n\nThe answer should then be (C) Middle adapters.",

So antibodies are not exclusively characteristic of the adaptive immune system.\n\n(B) T cells: T cells are part of the adaptive immune system, but similar to antibodies, other immune systems (like the innate immune system) also have cells with similar functions (like natural killer cells which can kill virally infected cells)\n\n(C) Memory T cells: Memory T cells are indeed a distinguishing character of the adaptive immunity. They are formed after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and can respond more quickly and effectively to subsequent encounters with that pathogen compared to the first encounter. Remembering specific pathogens is not a feature of the innate immune system, which reacts to pathogens in a generic way.\n\n(D) Clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells: This is also a feature characteristic for the adaptive immune response, but is not as specific as the memory T cells, since the clonal expansion could also occur in other immune responses when stimulated.\n\nGiven the above explanations, the most specific characteristic feature of the adaptive immune system is the production of memory cells that can remember the structure of a pathogen and start a more effective response upon subsequent encounters. \n\nTherefore, the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is (C) Memory T cells.",
