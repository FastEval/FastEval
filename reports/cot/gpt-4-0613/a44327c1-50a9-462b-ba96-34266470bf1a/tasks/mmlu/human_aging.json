            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "In order to answer this question, one needs to look at current research regarding the contributing factors associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease. \n\n(A) Being African or Hispanic American: Various studies suggest that people of these ethnic backgrounds have a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. Thus, being African or Hispanic American is not associated with a decreased risk.\n\n(B) Eating fish: Research indicates that a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as found in fish, could potentially contribute to a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease. The theory is that they may reduce inflammation in the brain and shield the brain from the damage that leads to cognitive decline and Alzheimer's.\n\n(C) A lower level of education: Various studies suggest that people with lower levels of education are at higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. This means a lower level of education is associated with an increased risk, not a decreased risk. \n\n(D) Being married: Research findings suggest that married people could have a decreased risk of Alzheimer's compared to those who are single. The reasoning behind this is that marriage may help people have better mental health and wellbeing, which are associated with lower Alzheimer's risk.\n\nFrom this reasoning, both eating fish (B) and being married (D) are associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's, but only one answer can be selected according to the question's requirement. Eating fish is more directly linked to the reduction of Alzheimer's risk based on the physiological benefits of omega-3 fatty acids to the brain. Plus, being married has indirect effects on mental health and could be influenced by a number of other confounding variables.\n\nTherefore, the answer that best fits the question is:\n\n(B) Eating fish",

            "model_answer": "The key to answering this question is understanding the concept of docility - it implies a submissive or compliant attitude. \n\nThe term \"docility hypothesis\" would therefore suggest a theory regarding the factors that cause individuals to become more docile, e.g., more submissive or compliant. \n\nOption A suggests that those with fewer capabilities are more vulnerable to environmental demands. While this is a valid assumption, it doesn't mention the docility factor, therefore it can't be the correct answer.\n\nOption B suggests that high environmental demands lead individuals to become more docile while Option C suggests the contrary, that high environmental demands make one less docile. Between these, Option B is more in line with the assumed understanding of docility - high stress or demands could cause people to become more compliant or submissive, i.e., more docile.\n\nOption D, however, also doesn't mention the docility factor and hence can't be right.\n\nBased on these analyses, the most appropriate statement reflecting the docility hypothesis is\n\n(B) Those who experience high environmental demands become more docile.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, it is necessary to consider what each option means and how it relates to memory improvement.\n\nStarting with option (A), aerobic exercise has been linked to improved memory and thinking skills. There is ample evidence stating that aerobic exercises increases the size of the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for verbal memory and learning.\n\nOption (B), acetylcholine, is a neurotransmitter in the brain that plays a crucial role in memory and learning. However, simply taking acetylcholine doesn't necessarily improve memory. Hence, this is not a direct cause-and-effect relationship but rather a biological correlation.\n\nOption (C) deals with taking gingko, a popular herb supplement often touted for its memory enhancing effects. However, research regarding the memory-enhancing effects of gingko is heavily debated. Therefore, we can\u2019t be sure that using gingko will lead to improved memory.\n\nOption (D), increasing social contacts, involves interacting with other people more often. Studies have suggested that socializing can support brain health and possibly delay the onset of dementia. But while it's related to general brain health, there's less concrete evidence of it directly improving memory.\n\nBased on these point-based explanations, it appears that the most supported answer is option (A) Aerobic exercise, as several studies have found direct benefits of aerobic exercise on memory improvement.\n\n(A)",

This happens because of the lifelong accumulation of photosensitive chemicals in the lens. This statement is also true and happens as we get older.\n\n(C) It becomes clouded: When proteins in the eye form clusters and cause the lens to become cloudy, it's a condition known as cataracts which is common in older age. Therefore, this statement is true and can occur as one grows older.\n\n(D) It fills with fluid: This statement is typically not true. The eye is filled with fluid from birth, and this does not significantly change with age.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to examine each option one by one and assess how they might impact the reaction time difference between older and younger adults.\n\nA) Practice regular aerobic exercise: Regular aerobic exercise does have numerous benefits for both physical and mental health. It can help to maintain cardiorespiratory fitness, body weight, and can also promote brain health. Research shows that regular aerobic exercise can improve cognitive functions, including those that could impact reaction time. Still, it doesn't specifically target reaction time, and its impact on reducing the difference in reaction time between older and younger adults isn't well established.\n\nB) Lift weights on a regular schedule: Weightlifting also has many health benefits, primarily related to muscle strength and bone density. However, it's not typically associated with improvements in reaction time, and it's unlikely to have a significant impact on reducing the reaction time difference between young and older adults.\n\nC) Consume large quantities of vitamins: There isn't much solid evidence to suggest that consuming large quantities of vitamins would significantly reduce the difference in reaction time between younger and older adults. While certain vitamins are crucial for brain health and cognitive function, consuming them in large amounts won't necessarily reduce the difference in reaction time between different age groups.\n\nD) Practice Tai chi: Tai chi is a martial art known for promoting balance, flexibility, and cardiovascular health. More importantly, it has a heightened focus on mindfulness and body awareness, which can play a role in reaction time. Multiple studies have shown that Tai chi can improve reaction time in older adults. As such, it is the most likely of the options to help reduce the difference in reaction time between younger and older adults. \n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, it most plausible that the reaction time difference between younger and older adults is reduced when older adults practice Tai chi.\n\n(D)",
