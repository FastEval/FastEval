This crucial part of an argument is often the result of the information or evidence provided before it. Implementing this understanding, let's look at each option to determine the conclusion of the argument.\n\n(A) This option speaks about how one could find the same lowered intelligence due to emotions in both their peers and regular patients. However, it doesn't seem to conclude anything but merely presents a situation.\n(B) Here it is being discussed that consciousness, being a strong defense mechanism, hinders the unconscious complexes. It explains a cause but doesn't conclude the argument.\n(D) This option just rephrases both parts of option (C) without the transition word \"because\" that shows the causal relationship.\n\n(C) This option states a difficulty resulting from the premise set earlier, which is the arrogance of our consciousness blocking the unconscious complexes. It concludes that because of the mentioned arrogance, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious and teach them that which contradicts their conscious knowledge. This seems to encapsulate what the passage is leading up to, making it the most probable conclusion.\n\nHence, the conclusion of the given argument is (C) Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.",
