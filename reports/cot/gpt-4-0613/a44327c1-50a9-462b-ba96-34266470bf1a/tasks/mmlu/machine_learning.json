There may be other unbiased estimators out of the linear regression\u2019s framework with a smaller variance, especially when the model's assumptions are not met.

In linear SVMs, support vectors are the data points that lie on the margin of the hyperplane. However, when we use a higher-degree polynomial kernel, the decision boundary isn't linear anymore.

It utilizes the positional information of pixels by considering local relationships among pixels, making it highly efficient at recognizing local patterns and spatial hierarchies. In other words, they \"look\" for features within an image (edges, shapes, etc.) and calculate how likely it is that these features belong to a given class.\n\n(B) Graph Networks: These networks are used mostly for data represented as graphs. They're excellent at handling relational data and understanding the connections and relationships between different entities. However, they're not particularly tailored to handle image data.\n\n(C) Fully Connected Networks: These networks are relatively simple and consist of layers of nodes where each node is connected to all nodes in the next layer. This works well for data where all features are equally important, but it has limitations when dealing with high-resolution images due to its inability to leverage local spatial correlations within the image. \n\n(D) RBF Networks: Radial basis function (RBF) networks are a type of artificial neural network using radial basis functions as activation functions. They have been applied in areas such as time series prediction, classification, and system control, but they're not particularly suitable for processing high-resolution images.\n\nBased on the above examination, the convolutional networks (A) would be the most suitable for classifying high-resolution images due to their design, which is particularly well-suited to image analysis.\n\n(A) convolutional networks",

The algorithm alternates between performing an expectation (E) step, which creates a function for the expectation of the log-likelihood evaluated using the current estimate for the parameters, and a maximization (M) step, which computes parameters maximizing the expected log-likelihood found on the E step.

For node H, it has one parent U. We will need two parameters: P(H|U) and P(H|\u00acU) because U can be either true or false, making a total of 2 parameters.\n   \n2. Then, for node U, it has two parents H, P. That means we have 2 possibilities for H and 2 possibilities for P, totaling 4 combinations: P(U|H,P), P(U|H,\u00acP), P(U|\u00acH,P), P(U|\u00acH,\u00acP).

High variance often results in overfitting our model to the training data, which means the model may not perform as well on new, unseen data.\n\nAs you add more and more data, your model will gradually have more information to learn from during training.
