            "model_answer": "The concept of marginal revenue and marginal cost comes from the field of economics and it refers to the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit of a product (marginal revenue) and the added cost of producing one more unit of a product (marginal cost).\n\nA fundamental principle in economics is that profit maximization occurs where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This is because at this point, the revenue gained from selling an additional unit perfectly matches the cost incurred from producing that unit, thus maximizing profit.\n\nLooking at the options, only (B) \"total revenue is equal to total cost\" relatively matches this principle. However, we need to clarify that this option could be misleading because this is not necessarily the greatest point of profit, rather it is said to be the breakeven point where no profit or loss incurs.\n\nNone of the other options are closely related to the principle of marginal revenue equals marginal cost. (A) talks about the greatest distance between total revenue and total cost which is not relevant. (C) refers to marginal product which is related to production not specifically to revenue and cost. (D) refers to total product, also irrelevant, it doesn't talk about the ratio of revenue to cost.\n\nTherefore, in light of all options being analyzed, even though it's not absolutely correct, the best and closest to the proper economic theory would be option (B). \n\nSo the answer is (B) total revenue is equal to total cost.",

            "model_answer": "The firm should look at the marginal product per dollar for both labor and capital. This calculation gives the additional output (in value) that one more dollar spent on each input will produce.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the marginal product per dollar for labor:\nThe marginal product of labor is 200 and the price of labor is $2. So, the marginal product per dollar for labor is 200/2 = 100.\n\nNext, let's calculate the marginal product per dollar for capital:\nThe marginal product of capital is 50 and the price of capital is $1. So, the marginal product per dollar for capital is 50/1 = 50.\n\nThe marginal product per dollar of labor is higher than that of capital, meaning that the firm gets more output for every dollar spent on labor than on capital. Therefore, it would be more efficient for the firm to decrease capital and increase labor.\n\nAs the firm increases labor and decreases capital, this would theoretically lead to a decrease in the marginal product of labor (since we're using more of it, the impact of each additional unit tends to decrease) and an increase in the marginal product of capital (since we're using less of it, the impact of each additional unit tends to increase).\n\nThe correct option is thus (C) Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital rises and the marginal product of labor falls.",

            "model_answer": "(A) The supply curve intersects the demand curve - In the realm of economics, where the supply curve intersects the demand curve is generally taken to be the point of equilibrium, but not specifically a Nash equilibrium. A Nash equilibrium speaks more to strategic decision making between parties and may not be at the direct intersection of supply and demand.\n\n(B) Neither party has an incentive to deviate from his or her strategy - This is directly influenced by the definition of Nash equilibrium. A Nash equilibrium, named after John Nash, is a solution concept of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only their own strategy. \n\n(C) The marginal revenue curve intersects the marginal cost curve - This typically defines the profit-maximizing level of output for a firm, which might or might not coincide with a Nash Equilibrium situation. \n\n(D) The equilibrium is unstable and each party would like to switch strategies - This is contrary to the definition of a Nash Equilibrium. In a Nash Equilibrium, neither party would see a benefit to unilaterally changing strategies.\n\nBased on the descriptions provided above, the answer that is most reflective of a Nash equilibrium is therefore:\n\n(B) neither party has an incentive to deviate from his or her strategy.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "An externality is a consequence of an economic activity that is experienced by unrelated third parties. It can be either positive or negative, depending on whether it benefits or harms the third parties. \n\nIt is not linked directly to the equilibrium price being artificially high (Option A) or low (Option B). In fact, an externality can potentially cause the equilibrium price to move in either direction, depending on whether the externality is positive or negative and whether it is being accounted for in the price.\n\nOption C suggests that externalities occur when markets are unable to reach equilibrium. This is incorrect because externalities can occur even in markets that are in equilibrium.\n\nOption D suggests that externalities result in an equilibrium that does not maximize the total benefit to society. This is typically what happens with externalities. For example, if a factory is polluting the environment (a negative externality), the total benefit to society is not maximized because the cost of the pollution is not being accounted for in the price of the factory's goods. The factory gets the benefit of cheap production costs, while society pays the cost in terms of environmental damage.\n\n(D) results in an equilibrium that does not maximize the total benefit to society",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The government discourages collusion between large firms in the same industry primarily because it reduces competition. When competition is reduced, firms can manipulate the market to their advantage.\n\nCollusion allows firms to act like a monopoly, where they can collectively reduce the output levels, making the product or service more scarce. This scarcity drives the prices up, making consumers pay more than they would under normal competitive conditions. This adversely affects consumer welfare as consumers have to pay higher prices.\n\nAdditionally, higher prices mean higher profits for the firms involved. This joint profit maximization comes at the cost of the consumer, as the consumer surplus is reduced. Consumer surplus is the difference between what consumers are willing to pay for a good or service and the market price they actually pay. When prices are driven up, this surplus shrinks, leading to a loss for consumers. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(D) Joint profit maximization costs society consumer surplus as the price rises above competitive levels.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking us to identify the nature of the demand curve that an oligopolist faces when other firms in the market will follow a price decrease, but not a price increase.\n\nLet's go through the options:\n\n(A) A perfectly horizontal demand curve suggests that the quantity demanded changes greatly even with a small price change. However, it does not encapsulate the action of rival firms to price changes.\n\n(B) A highly inelastic demand curve suggests that quantity demanded is not much responsive to price changes. However, it does not describe the scenario where rival firms follow a decline in prices but not an increase.\n\n(C) A highly elastic demand curve shows that a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity demanded. However, it does not distinguish the consequences of price rises versus price decreases.\n\n(D) A demand curve consisting of two discontinuous segments can depict a scenario where the responses to price decreases and price increases are different. \n\nIn the case of an oligopoly where rival firms will follow a price decrease but not a price increase, if one firm increases its price, customers will shift to its rival firms thus causing a large drop in its demand, leading to a steep portion of the demand curve. Conversely, if the firm decreases its price, customers from other firms will start buying from it, as well as the other firms will also reduce their prices. So the increase in demand would be limited and the slope of demand curve in this segment would be less steep.\n\nTherefore, the demand curve facing such an oligopolist would have two different slopes at the increasing and decreasing portions, leading to a discontinuous or \"kinked\" demand curve. \n\nHence, the answer is (D) A demand curve consisting of two discontinuous segments.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The question requires an understanding of what a wage differential is. A wage differential, broadly speaking, is the difference in wages between workers with different skills, experience, and levels of education (human capital), those working in different regions or industries, or those performing jobs with different levels of risk or discomfort. In other words, wage differentials are explained by factors particular to the employee or the nature of the work.\n\n(A) Higher risk job: This could contribute to a wage differential, since individuals might require higher compensation for jobs that involve more physical or financial risk.\n\n(B) Investment in human capital: This also could contribute to a wage differential, since more educated or experienced workers tend to earn higher wages than less educated or experienced workers.\n\n(D) Racial discrimination: Unfortunately, this can contribute to wage differentials as well. Studies have shown that people of different races and ethnicities are often paid different wages, even when they do the same work. Although this is unjust and illegal in many places, it does happen, and therefore it is a potential basis for wage differentials.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n(C) Increase in production of SUVs: The production increase of a single product, such as SUVs, doesn\u2019t directly serve as a basis for wage differential. The wage would depend on factors like the skill required for the job, the risk involved, the level of education required, etc., rather than on the specific products that are being produced.\n\nAs such, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Increase in production of SUVs.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Analyzing each of these concepts in relation to the answer options:\n\n1. Patents: Patents provide a company with exclusive rights to manufacture, use, or sell a particular invention for a set period. This in itself can deter other companies from entering the market - indicating it may function as a barrier to entry.\n\n2. Control of resources: If one firm has control over a critical resource necessary for production, this can deter other firms from entering the market because they can't access the needed resources - potentially another barrier to entry.\n\n3. Economies of scale: This refers to the cost advantages that a firm can achieve by increasing production. As production increases, the cost per unit tends to decrease, thus providing the firm with a competitive advantage. This is not specifically a requirement for price discrimination, nor for earning short-run profits, especially in industries with high upfront costs. But it could function as a barrier to entry for smaller firms that can't achieve the same scale of production.\n\n4. Exclusive licenses: If a firm has exclusive licenses to produce or sell certain goods/services, other firms are legally barred from doing the same, which could potentially function as a barrier to entry.\n\nTaking everything into consideration, these elements aren't specifically required for price discrimination or for earning short-run profits. They also are not sources of elastic demand.

This information can help us to determine the cost nature of the army-figures industry, but not whether the industry is profit-making or not, since profitability is influenced by many other factors beyond raw material demand.\n\nThe main types of industries in relation to costs that are mentioned are increasing-cost, constant-cost, and decreasing-cost industries.\n\nAn increasing-cost industry is where the costs of production go up as output increases, usually because resources needed for production become scarcer and more expensive as more producers enter the industry and demand for those resources rise.\n\nA constant-cost industry is one where the costs of production remain the same, no matter how much output increases or decreases. This may happen when the resources required for production are abundant or easily substitutable.\n\nA decreasing-cost industry is where costs go down as output increases, usually due to economies of scale: as production increases, the cost per unit decreases because fixed costs (overhead, machinery, etc.) are spread out over a larger quantity of output.\n\nFrom the details provided, the army-figures industry uses only a small fraction of the overall plastic demand. This suggests that the resources (plastics, in this case) this industry requires to produce its goods are not scarce or being competed over at a large scale, indicating that the industry is more likely to have constant costs regardless of its output variation: even if it's production increases or decreases, the cost per unit does not change since plastic is not a scarce resource for this industry. \n\nSo, considering the above information, the plausible conclusion would be:\n\n(B) constant-cost industry.",
