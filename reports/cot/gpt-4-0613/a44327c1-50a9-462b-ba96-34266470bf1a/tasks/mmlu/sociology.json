            "model_answer": "Mass-society theory is a perspective that suggests that modern society is characterized by an overall weakening of social ties and atomization of individuals, due to complex industrial societies. High scale media replace the direct personal interactions and control and manipulate their audiences to passivity. Therefore,\n\n(A) The theory does not focus specifically on market forces determining the content of media. It is more concerned with the audience's passive consumption of media, so this option is not correct.\n \n(B) While the theory does touch on the idea of ideological manipulation, it's focus is not on class domination but rather on mass media's control of information to a wide, passive, undifferentiated audience. Therefore this option is incorrect.\n\n(C) The theory emphasizes that media manipulates people into being passive consumers, which matches this option's description. \n\n(D) The idea of audiences making selective interpretations of media messages contradicts the theory's main point about passive consumption of media, so this option is not correct.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers.",

            "model_answer": "First, let's understand what the ecological approach refers to in the context of urban sociology. \n\nIn urban sociology, the ecological approach is a perspective that emphasizes the \"natural\" distribution of city neighborhoods into areas sorted by socio-economic status as well as the competition for space and resources in a city. \n\nLet's now apply this definition to evaluate the given options. \n\n(A) \"How social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources.\" - This aligns with the ecological approach as it discusses the natural division of the city into different areas by social groups and the competition for resources. \n\n(B) \"The forms of wildlife and natural habitats that could be found on the edges of the city.\" - This does not match the definition of the ecological approach within urban sociology, as it primarily focuses on wildlife and natural habitats rather than human behavior. \n\n(C) \"The way in which people organized collective protests about environmental issues.\" - This is more related to environmental socialism or activism, not particularly to the ecological approach in urban sociology. \n\n(D) \"How men and women used the city's public spaces differently.\" - While this could be part of an analysis within urban sociology, it does not explicitly fit with the ecological approach and its emphasis on spatial distribution and resource competition. \n\nGiven the reasons above, the most direct match to the ecological approach to urban sociology is option A. \n\nSo, the answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal knowledge, but I can provide information based on sources. Howard S. Becker, a noted sociologist, has conducted considerable research on marijuana use. \n\nHis work primarily involves studying how individuals learn to smoke marijuana and connect the act to certain experiences or sensations. His research uncovered that the process is gradual and is influenced heavily by social learning within groups termed as deviant. However, he did also express that marijuana usage did not usually result in criminal behavior, unlike what other sociologists suggested. \n\nIt is important to note that Becker never made judgements on whether people should or should not pursue marijuana use. His research was descriptive and focused on outlining social processes, not suggesting moral guidelines.\n\nTo summarize: \n- Becker didn't insist the increasing use of cannabis among all young people sectors in the 1970s. \n- Becker's work emphasized the role of social learning in the gradual adoption of marijuana use, positioning it within a \"deviant career\" context.\n- He did not judge cannabis use as a dangerous hobby that should be forbidden for young people.\n- Becker did research on how individuals learn to enjoy marijuana, suggesting it's not as much fun as some people suggested.\n\nConsequently, the correct answer is: \n\n(B) learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking about the characteristics of the middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century. \n\n(A) Refers to the idea that the middle classes were predominantly urban dwellers who played active roles in their communities, through civic bodies and voluntary associations. This is likely as urbanisation and the rise of the middle classes were both significant aspects of the 19th century, especially with the industrial revolution.\n \n(B) Suggests that the middle classes were too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness. This implies that there was a wide range of professions, backgrounds and lifestyles within the middle classes, which might have led to a lack of a unified class identity. \n\n(C) Posits that these classes were often involved in 'white collar' work, referring to jobs in fields such as business, management, and the professions rather than manual or industrial labour. This is also likely as one of the defining features of the middle classes was their involvement in such work.\n\nTherefore, the option (D) all of the above will be the correct answer as all the options A, B, and C provide a correct description of the middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century.\n\n(D) all of the above",

Various online platforms and applications collect data about users and use it for promotional purposes.\n\nOption (B) reduce prison overcrowding by the use of electronic tagging: Through technological surveillance, electronic tagging has become a feasible method for keeping track of individuals who might otherwise occupy prison space for minor offenses, reducing overcrowding.\n\nOption (C) monitor employees' activities at work: With technological surveillance, it has become far easier to monitor employee productivity, research habits, and compliance with company policies, among other things.\n\nIt can be seen that all three options presented are valid scenarios where technological forms of surveillance have made those actions easier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) all of the above.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies developed the sociological concepts of Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft to analyze and characterize the types of relationships found in different social structures. \n\nGemeinschaft often translated as community, is characterized by small, close-knit, often rural communities where strong personal relationships are governed by traditional rules and moral attitudes. On the other hand, Gesellschaft, often translated as society, is characterized by large, impersonal, urban societies where relationships are based on individual interests and direct negotiation, rather than on traditional norms.\n\nWe will rule out Gesellschaft, or option (C), since it is described as another type of relationship that contrasts with Gemeinschaft.\n\nThe concepts of organic solidarity and mechanical solidarity were developed by another sociologist, Emile Durkheim.\n\nOrganic solidarity, (Option A), a social unity based on a division of labor that results in individuals depending on others to survive. It's associated with modern, industrialized societies that are complex and interdependent, which is similar to Tonnies\u2019s concept of Gesellschaft rather than Gemeinschaft. So, option A won't be our answer.\n\nMechanical solidarity, (Option B), describes societies where individuals share common values and strong collective conscience. This is similar to small, close-knit communities described by T\u00f6nnies\u2019s concept of Gemeinschaft.\n\nOn the other hand, anomie (Option D), is a concept introduced by Durkheim, that refers to a state of normlessness, the lack of social or ethical norms in an individual or society.\n\nFrom the above discussion, it's clear that mechanical solidarity (Option B) resembles Gemeinschaft, as both describe societies that are relatively homogenous with strong communal bonds and shared values.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "This question is asking for the reasoning behind the growth in income inequality in the 1980s, so we need to think about that in terms of each of these potential answers.\n\n(A) The increasing rates of income tax equally for all occupational groups might impact the total amount of money that people take home, but it wouldn't necessarily result in increased inequality. A progressive tax system, where higher income groups are taxed at higher rates, might lead to decreased income inequality. But here, the taxes increased equally for all groups, so this doesn't explain the increased inequality.\n\n(B) If there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them, it could lead to increased income inequality. This is because those who have the skills and qualifications to take on these jobs would potentially earn more, leading to a wider gap between high earners and low earners.\n\n(C) The price of consumer goods rising at a higher rate than earnings is known as inflation. If inflation is higher than wage increases, people\u2019s purchasing power would be diminished. However, it doesn\u2019t directly relate to income inequality. It would impact everyone across different income groups, albeit potentially different degrees.\n\n(D) Growing unemployment making more people dependent on welfare benefits would potentially increase income inequality. This is because those who are unemployed would have to rely on these benefits, which are typically less than what they would earn if they were employed, leading to lower overall income.\n\nAfter examining each option, (B) seems like the most plausible answer because in this scenario, those with more skills and qualifications could earn significantly more than those without, leading to increased income inequality.\n\nThe answer is (B).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what normalizing a deviant act means. \n\nA deviant act refers to behavior that deviates from the accepted standards or norms in a society or community. When a deviant act is 'normalized', it means that this behavior, which was previously considered outside the norm or odd, is now accepted as part of common, regular, or \"normal\" behavior within the society or group.\n\nSo, now let's evaluate each option against this understanding:\n- (A) recognised as breaking an important norm of behaviour - This option does not fit as normalization of a deviant act does not involve continued recognition of the act as breaking a norm. Instead, the act is now seen as meeting societal norms.\n- (B) seen a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character - This is also wrong because a normalized deviant act is not seen as a temporary phenomenon but rather an act that has gained general acceptability or convention.\n- (C) the first step in establishing a deviant career - This is not true too. Normalizing a deviant act has nothing to do with embarking on a deviant career. It's more about transforming the perception of an act from being considered deviant to being identified as normal.\n- (D) attributed to the person's genetic or anatomical make up - This doesn't reflect the idea of \"normalization.\" Normalizing an act doesn't necessarily link it to genetics or biology, but rather to societal perception and acceptance.\n\nSo none of the options align perfectly with the definition of normalizing a deviant act. But it seems none of them is absolutely correct, hence, explaining this problem might lead to considering one as the least incorrect. \n\nGiven this, option (A) is the \"least wrong\" as it is the only one that mentions the reclassification of behavior (i.e., from being an important norm-breaking behavior to a normalized one.), albeit it does not cover the essence of normalizing a deviant act completely. So, (A) is likely the correct answer.\n\n(A)",

Therefore, we cannot provide an answer to this question.
