            "question": "Suppose that an expansionary fiscal policy leads to a large increase in real output and a small increase in the price level. From this it can be inferred that\n\n(A) inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus.\n(B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n(C) aggregate supply decreased.\n(D) aggregate demand is steeply sloped.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The provided information indicates that expansionary fiscal policy \u2013 which could be a reduction in taxes or an increase in government spending \u2013 has led to a substantial shift towards growth in real output, with only a minor uptick in the price level.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Inflation usually results in an increase in the general price level. If the inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus (option A), the increase in the price level would probably be much larger after the fiscal expansion. So, it is less likely.\n\n2. Option C suggests that aggregate supply decreased. However, a decrease in aggregate supply would lead to higher prices (thus, generating higher inflation) and lower quantities of goods and services produced. So, option C contradicts with the given information.\n\n3. A steeply sloped aggregate demand curve (option D) implies that changes in price won't significantly affect the quantity of goods and services demanded. However, it doesn't alone speak to the general increase in real output or the modest increase in the price level presented in the problem.\n\n4. Finally, option B suggests that the economy initially had some unemployed resources. When an economy has unemployed resources (such as labor, capital) and there's an increase in aggregate demand due to expansionary fiscal policy, these resources can be utilized to increase output - this increases the real GDP. Since these resources were initially unemployed, this increase in outputs does not lead to a large increase in the price level. In fact, the price level increase is modest, as these resources can be employed without bidding up prices too much. This scenario aligns well with the description in the question.\n\nSo, after considering all the options, it can be concluded that option B \u2013 \"the economy initially had some unemployed resources\" \u2013 is the most likely inference that can be drawn from the facts given.\n\nHence, the Answer is (B).",

            "model_answer": "The Aggregate Demand (AD) curve shows the total spending on domestic goods and services at each price level. The Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve shows the total quantity of goods and services that firms will produce and sell at each price level. \n\nIf both SRAS and AD increase, it means that both production and spending on goods and services are increasing. \n\nWhen AD increases, it implies that at the same price level, more goods and services are demanded, leading to increase in output and a potential increase in price level due to higher demand.\n\nWhen SRAS increases, it implies that more goods and services can be produced at the same price level, leading to an increase in output (Real GDP) and a potential decrease in price level due to higher supply. \n\nPutting that together, we perceive that both real GDP and price level would rise. Real GDP rises because there is more demand as well as more supply. The price level would generally rise because there's greater demand setting upward pressure on prices. However, there's also more supply which could potentially put downward pressure on price level. Yet, in general, with high demand, firms quite often obtain pricing power which may cause price level to rise (Inflation).\n\nSo, answer is:\n\n(B) Both the price level and real GDP rise.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Tariffs and quotas are tools used to restrict international trade. A tariff is a tax imposed on imports, while a quota is a limit on the number or value of goods that can be imported.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\n(A) The effect of tariffs and quotas is to increase the cost of imports. Domestic producers face less competition, and there is less incentive for them to lower their own prices. Therefore, tariffs and quotas generally do not result in lower domestic prices.\n\n(B) The impact on the amount of the product sold domestically depends on various factors, including the elasticity of demand for the product. If demand is inelastic, the quantity sold domestically may not change much, or could even increase if domestic producers step in to fill the gap left by restricted imports. On the other hand, if demand is elastic, the higher price caused by the tariff or quota could reduce the amount sold.\n\n(C) As explained above, the effect on the amount sold domestically could go either way, depending on demand elasticity. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that tariffs and quotas always lower the amount sold domestically.\n\n(D) Similarly, it is also not accurate to say that tariffs and quotas always raise the amount sold domestically. If demand is elastic, the amount sold could decrease.\n\nTherefore, based on the above analysis, the most reasonable choice is that tariffs and quotas sometimes raise and sometimes lower the amount of product sold domestically.\n\nSo, the answer is (B).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The price of Treasury bonds is negatively correlated with interest rates. This means that when interest rates rise, the price of bonds generally falls, and when interest rates fall, the price of bonds typically rises. \n\nA) Expansionary monetary policy generally results in lower interest rates. These lower interest rates make bonds more attractive because their fixed interest payments become more valuable. Therefore, expansionary monetary policy tends to increase bond prices, not decrease them.\n\nB) Contractionary monetary policy, on the other hand, generally results in higher interest rates. These higher interest rates make the established interest payments from existing bonds less attractive, so their value or price will typically fall. \n\nC) A depreciating dollar implies that the value of dollar-denominated assets, like Treasury bonds, declines for investors using other currencies. However, a falling dollar can have varied effects on interest rates, which are the primary determinant of bond prices. It is also not the primary and direct cause for a fall in Treasury bond prices.\n\nD) Fiscal policy designed to reduce the budget deficit might actually cause Treasury bond prices to rise. When the government reduces its deficit, it is borrowing less, which can cause interest rates to fall, which would then raise the value (price) of existing bonds. \n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is an action that actively increases interest rates, that is a contractionary monetary policy.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Let's evaluate each of the given options:\n\n(A) Nominal GDP falls: In theory, a decrease in nominal GDP indicates that there is a contraction in the economy. If the income of households falls due to this, they'd likely desire to save more money. However, this does not immediately indicate that they demand more money to store as an asset.\n\n(B) The nominal interest rate falls: If nominal interest rates fall, then the cost of borrowing money becomes cheaper. This could potentially make holding onto cash less attractive since the cash could be invested or spent without paying a high interest cost. However, low interest rates can also mean low return on savings, which can mean households may want to save more money rather than spend or invest.\n\n(C) Bond prices fall: When bond prices fall, it implies the rise of bond yields (or interest rates), making bonds more attractive. So, households would likely prefer to buy bonds instead of holding cash. \n\n(D) The supply of money falls: If the supply of money falls, this would generally mean there is less money available. However, it does not necessarily indicate an increase in the demand for money. \n\nSo out of all options, households demand more money as an asset when the nominal interest rate falls (option B).

Allocative efficiency does not stipulate anything about the production of inferior goods. Efficient allocation can still involve production of inferior goods depending on the market demand for those goods.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect.
