            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, let's determine the annual income from renting the limousine. \n\nAssuming the limousine is rented for 2 hours everyday, the daily income is 2 hours * $245/hour = $490. \n\nThe estimated annual income from renting the car every day of the year would be $490/day * 365 days/year = $178,850.\n\nNext, let's consider the daily costs of $50. Over a year, these costs will add up to $50/day * 365 days/year = $18,250.\n\nTo calculate the net income, we need to subtract the expenses from the gross income. This gives us $178,850 (income) - $18,250 (expenses) = $160,600.\n\nNow we need to determine the return on investment (ROI), which is calculated by dividing the net income by the initial cost of the investment and then multiplying by 100 to convert it into percentage. \n\nIn this case, the ROI would be ($160,600 / $98,000) * 100 = approximately 163.88%.\n\nThe closest option to this result is (A) 164%. So, the correct answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "Let's break down the effect of not recording a credit purchase on the balance sheet.\n\n1. Assets: Assets include all the properties owned by a business, such as cash, inventories, accounts receivable, etc. In this case, the inventory has correctly been included at the year-end, even though the purchase was not recorded. So, the inventory, which is part of the assets, is correctly stated. Hence, the assets are not affected.\n\n2. Liabilities: Liabilities are the debts or obligations owed by a business. When we purchase merchandise on credit, accounts payable (a type of liability) increases. But since the purchase was not recorded, the increase in accounts payable wasn't accounted for. This implies our liabilities on the balance sheet are understated.\n\nSo, we can see that the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise does not affect assets but understates liabilities.\n\nTherefore the answer is (B) No effect Understated.",

            "model_answer": "Let's break down each option to determine which one is correct about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer:\n\n(A) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\nThis statement is partially correct. However, the difference in conclusions does not arise from the sampling process itself, but rather the nonsampling risks such as the use of inappropriate audit procedures, misinterpretation of audit evidence and results, etc. Nonsampling risks exist whether or not the auditor samples.\n\n(B) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\nThis statement is correct. A \"nonsampling risk\" reflects the chance that an auditor makes an error not related to sampling method, such as failing to identify a significant risk, not recognizing a misstatement when examining documentation, or misinterpreting information.\n\n(C) Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\nThis is not completely correct. Sampling risk arises from the possibility that the auditor\u2019s conclusion, based on a sample, may be different from the conclusion reached if the entire population were subjected to the same audit procedure.\n\n(D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\nThis statement is not accurate either. The selection of inappropriate audit procedure is a nonsampling risk, not a sampling risk.\n\nSo, let's return to our question to find which of the four statements about audit sampling risks is correct for a nonissuer. The only completely accurate statement is (B), which explains that nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor fails to recognize misstatements.\n\n(B)",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understanding the question \n\nThe question is about the procedures an auditor would generally perform in subsequent events. Subsequent events refer to events that occur after the end of the audit but before the audit report is issued. The auditor's objective in this procedure is to identify all such events that may require adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\n\nStep 2: Evaluating the options\n\n(A) Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end: This is closely related to valuation and cut-off assertions, and Such an event is typically reviewed as part of the audit but it is not specifically associated with subsequent events.\n\n(B) Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate: This concerns evaluation of the controls implemented by the client following an earlier audit. This is not connected to subsequent event procedures. \n\n(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end: This could include checking for deposits or payments received after the year-end, that relates to transactions prior to the year end. It is also not a typical procedure for subsequent events.\n\n(D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited: This is typically part of subsequent event procedures. By comparing later interim statements with those being audited, an auditor can identify transactions or events that have occurred since end of the period, which those may require adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\n\nStep 3: Choosing the correct option\n\nAs per the above evaluation, the only option that aligns with the standard procedures generally performed by an auditor in subsequent events is Option D.\n\nThe answer is (D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.",

            "question": "On July 1 year 7 Dean Co. issued at a premium bonds with a due date of July 1 year 12.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First, let's understand the concepts involved:\n\nThe premium on bonds payable refers to the amount by which a bond's issue price exceeds its face value. This usually occurs when bonds are issued at a higher interest rate than the market rate. In such a situation, bond investors are willing to pay more for the bond, leading to a premium.\n\nThis premium reduces the cost of borrowing and is amortized over the life of the bond. Amortization means it is gradually written off in the company\u2019s financial statements. This reduces the amount of interest expense recorded each period.\n\nThere are two accepted methods of bond premium amortization: straight-line and effective interest.\n\n1. The straight-line method divides the total premium by the number of periods until maturity to find the amount to amortize each period. This results in the same amount of bond premium being amortized each period.\n\n2. The effective-interest method calculates interest expense each period based on the carrying amount of the bond at the start of the period. It results in a decreasing amount of bond premium being amortized each period.\n\nIf Dean Co. incorrectly used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method, it means they amortized an equal portion of the bond premium each year, instead of a decreasing amount each year. As a result, the bond carrying amount (which includes the unamortized premium) would be understated compared to correct use of the effective interest method. This is because under the straight-line method, more of the premium would have been amortized by June 30, year 12, leaving less of it to be added to the bond carrying amount.\n\nWhen the bond carrying amount is understated, this means the bonds payable liability on the balance sheet is understated, which results in an overstatement of the company's equity. More specifically, retained earnings would be overstated because the excessive bond premium amortization under the straight-line method would have reduced interest expense, thereby increasing net income and retained earnings.\n\nSo, the bond carrying amount was understated, and retained earnings were overstated due to the error in method.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Understated Overstated.",

Annual Coupon Payment: The coupon payment is 5% of $100 = $5 per year. To calculate the present value of these coupon payments, we have to discount them by the given yield (which is 6%). We will do this for each year and then sum them up.\n\n2. The principal payment (face value) is paid back at the end of year 3, so we discount the face value by the yield rate to bring it to present value.\n\nLet's calculate the present value for each cash flow:\n\n1. For year 1, the coupon's present value = $5/(1+6%)^1 = $4.72\n2. For year 2, the coupon's present value = $5/(1+6%)^2 = $4.45\n3. For year 3, the coupon's present value = $5/(1+6%)^3 = $4.20\n4. The present value of the face value = $100/(1+6%)^3 = $83.43\n\nNow, let's add these present values to find out the price of the bond.\n\nThe price of the bond is therefore $4.72 + $4.45 + $4.20 + $83.43 = $96.80\n\nThe closest answer to this calculated price would be:\n\n(C) $96.71",

This is correct since the company has a plan to sell the building in the near future, so it would reasonably reclassify the building as an asset held for sale.\n\n(B) It will be classified as a current asset. This can be correct as well. Current assets are assets that can be converted into cash in one year or less. Since the company plans to sell the building in four months, it could be considered a current asset.\n\n(C) It will no longer be depreciated. This is also correct. Once the decision to sell has been made, the company should stop depreciating the building, as it is no longer benefiting from its use.\n\n(D) It will be valued at historical cost.
