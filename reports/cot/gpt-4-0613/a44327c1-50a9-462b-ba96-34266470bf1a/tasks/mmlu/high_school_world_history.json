            "model_answer": "To answer this question, it is important to understand the context of the excerpt and identify key information from it. \n\nThe passage cited is from a keynote address by Indonesian leader Sukarno presented at the Bandung Conference in 1955. The Bandung Conference, held in Indonesia, was a significant milestone in building relationships between African and Asian nations. Its primary focus was on self-determination, mutual interests, and opposition to colonialism and neo-colonialism by any nation.\n\nThe statement is filled with calls for peace, independence, upbuilding, and unifying Asian and African nations. Sukarno emphasizes the urgency of preserving peace, the continuity of revolutions, and the need to mobilize spiritual, moral, and political strength for peace.\n\nFrom the options provided, we can see that:\n\n(A) The formation of the non-aligned movement: The tone and content of the speech align with the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement, which aimed to create an independent path in world politics that would not bring them into the ranks of either the US or the USSR during the Cold War.\n\n(B) Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation: While the speech speaks about peace, it doesn't specifically reference global disarmament or nuclear non-proliferation.\n\n(C) The Green Revolution in agriculture: The passage doesn't have any relevance to agricultural developments or the Green Revolution.\n\n(D) Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology: The speech undisputedly calls for unity among Asian and African nations but doesn't solely focus on the mobilization of a pan-Asian ideology.\n\nFrom the given options and comparing with the content of the speech, the development closely associated with the statement could be the formation of the non-aligned movement. The Bandung Conference is widely seen as a precursor to the Non-Aligned Movement. The speech doesn't directly connect to global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation although it speaks about peace. The Green Revolution and Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology don't appear to be the main focus of the speech's content.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) The formation of the non-aligned movement.",

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

It highlights how the adoption and further development of such a strategically important technological innovation was conditioned by local circumstances, rather than reflecting a global trend.\n\nOption A would seem like a possible choice as the passage does discuss a specific technology, specifically gunpowder weaponry. However, the passage does not address the aspect of sharing this technology between societies. Instead it focuses on how each society developed its own approach to utilizing this technology based on the unique challenges they were facing.\n\nOption C is not relevant as there is no mention of Silk Road commerce or any changes that happened to it after 1500 C.E.\n\nOption D is also not directly related as the passage does not discuss how climate affected cultural diffusion. \n\nThis brings us to option B. This option is relevant as the passage discusses the adoption of gunpowder weaponry by European nations and their further development of it. The passage suggests that this adoption and further improvement was one aspect that may have contributed to the later military superiority of European nations in the modern era. Conversely, China\u2019s deviation from the development of this technology due to its unique circumstances is also discussed.\n\nTherefore, the argument in this passage most closely relates to the question of why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era. \n\n(B)",

He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him.

While the evidence is not direct, it is nonetheless telling when one considers the historical context. Some possibilities include the adoption of traditions or the possession of goods that are likely to have originated from Asia.\n\n(A) The passage mentions that the king has horses. However, there is no explicit mention of these horses being of Mongol origin - this is an interpretation rather than a stated fact. Horses were not exclusive to Asia, and therefore this evidence is insufficient to establish a connection to Asian trade.\n\n(B) The king had adopted certain traditions, but these are not explicitly stated as being the 'kow-tow' tradition of China. Therefore, this statement does not provide direct evidence of trade with Asia.\n\n(C) The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, but the passage does not link these to India. Gold and jewels were widespread across many regions, including within Ghana itself, given that the passage describes a rich gold mine in the king's country. Therefore, this evidence does not directly indicate trade with Asia.\n\n(D) The passage mentions that the people in the king's court wore silk robes. Silk is historically associated with Asia, particularly China, where it was discovered and largely produced. This suggests that silk may have been imported from Asia, indicating trade connection.\n\nConsidering these options, only (D) provides the factual information stated directly in the passage with a clear direct link to Asian trade.\n \nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D)",

The text does not directly mention which event Sukarno attempted to remain neutral during. However, clues can be drawn from the context and time frame. Sukarno was the leader of Indonesia from 1945 to 1967.\n\nOption (A), the Arab-Israeli conflict, could be a plausible context. However, there is no explicit mention of the Middle East or related politics in the passage.\n\nOption (B), the Korean War, occurred between 1950 and 1953. This falls within Sukarno's term of office. However, the speech is specifically addressing the peoples of Asia and Africa, and there is no specific mention or hint towards tensions in the Korean peninsula.\n\nOption (D), the Vietnam conflicts, refers to a timespan beginning in the mid-1950s and escalating into the 1960s and 1970s. This would be slightly later than the Bandung Conference in 1955, so it is less likely to be the correct answer.\n\nOption (C), the Cold War, spanned from 1947 to 1991 and dominated global politics during Sukarno's term, affecting nations around the world, including those in Asia and Africa.

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away.

He thought the Russians would accept this arrangement.\n\nNow, considering all of the options:\n\n(A) This is not correct. Nowhere does it state that Korea became a part of Japan's territory. In fact, the opposite is true. The passage suggests that Japanese forces were surrendering to American and Russian authorities in Korea.\n\n(B) The passage does not indicate that the Americans established freedom for all Koreans. Bonesteel's main intent was to prevent Russia from gaining control of all of Korea, rather than set up freedom for Koreans.\n\n(C) There\u2019s no mention of the Korean economy in the passage, so we can\u2019t conclude that the Korean economy never recovered.\n\n(D) The passage tells us that the decision was made to use the 38th parallel as a dividing line for the surrender of Japanese forces in Korea. This lead to Korea being divided into territories controlled by American and Russian authorities, which in turn laid the groundwork for Korea's current division into two nations along the 38th parallel, namely North Korea and South Korea. \n\nTherefore, the events depicted in the passage most likely led to the division of Korea into two separate parts, which corresponds to option D.\n\nAnswer: (D) Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.",
