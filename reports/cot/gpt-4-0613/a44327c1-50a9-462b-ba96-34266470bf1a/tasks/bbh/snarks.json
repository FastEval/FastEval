A sarcastic statement would normally include a negative sentiment or have an underlying tone that is contrary to the literal meaning of the words.\n\nOption (A) is a straightforward statement that highlights someone's charitable effort, expressing admiration for the person's efforts to help children in need. There is no irony or mockery expressed in this statement; it is sincere and positive.\n\nOption (B), however, is sarcastic because it describes someone trying to promote a charity stream - a clearly positive and admirable action - as being something terrible. The negative sentiment here (\u201cterrible person\u201d) utterly contrasts with the later part of the sentence (\"trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need\"), which inherently implies positive and praiseworthy actions. The sarcasm lies in this clear contradiction; the person is obviously not terrible if he's promoting a charity stream that helps needy children, indicating that the statement is said in jest or to imply the opposite.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(B)",

It can be used to highlight absurdities or idiosyncrasies, and it often involves an insincere tone or expression of something which is the opposite of the intended meaning.\n\nLet's apply this to our two choices:\n\n(A) Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it okay - This statement could be seen as sarcastic because it suggests that 'memeing' about being racist makes it alright, when in reality, it's often seen as quite the opposite. This could be an example of sarcasm where the speaker says the opposite of what they mean as a form of mockery or criticism.\n\n(B) Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it toxic - This statement is more of a direct opinion, and doesn't contain the ironic or contradictory elements usually present in sarcasm. This statement suggests that 'memeing' perpetuates the toxicity of racism, and does not employ the kind of irony or flipped expectation that characterizes sarcasm.\n\nBased on these observations, it seems that option (A) is more likely to be the sarcastic statement.\n\nSo the answer is (A)",

It is much easier\" - This statement is arguably sarcastic because it implies that being poor is a choice and that one can simply decide to be wealthy, which is, in reality, a complex issue affected by numerous factors beyond an individual's control. Thus, it may be seen as mockingly oversimplifying the issue, making it sarcasm.\n\n(B) \"Have you tried not being rude? It is much easier\" - This is more of a straight statement, suggesting that the person should try being polite as it may be easier or better for them. While it may come across as a little sharp or biting, it is not sarcastic as it doesn't use irony or mock someone in the way that option A does.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sarcastic statement would be the one that makes a mocking oversimplification about a complex issue, which is option A.\n\n(A)",

Let's get rid of the trams and build carriages instead\nThis statement is suggesting to replace trams, a modern mean of transportation, with carriages, an outdated mean of transportation.

While it can also be delivered with a sarcastic tone, we can't say for sure that it's sarcastic based solely on the text.\n\n(B) Working at a McDonald's has made me an amazing chef\nThis statement is more likely to be sarcastic. McDonald's is a fast food chain known for its standardized, repetitive, and simple cooking procedures. Therefore, the idea that working in such an environment could make someone an amazing chef is much more clearly intended to be humorous or ironic.

However, sometimes the content of the statement itself can hint towards sarcasm.\n\nLet's look at the two options:\n\n(A) \"Working the printer is too complex for me\"\nMost people can operate a printer pretty easily. Usually, it's not considered a complex task. Thus, this statement can be seen as sarcastic because it suggests an everyday task is too hard for the speaker, which is likely not the case.\n\n(B) \"Working the microprocessor is too complex for me\"\nIt's quite reasonable to find working with a microprocessor complex, especially for a person not specialized in electronics or computer science. Therefore, it's less likely this statement is sarcastic.\n\nSo, sarcastic is likely the statement which makes a common task to sound overly complicated.\n\n(A) Working the printer is too complex for me.",

            "model_answer": "A sarcastic statement is a statement that is made to mock or criticize something in an ironical way. It is often used to express the opposite of what is literally said but in a twisted, often negative, way.\n\nLooking at statement (A), the phrase \"Because no world needs more kids with trust issues and psychological problems than we already have!\" seems to be expressing a disapproval of something (possibly some action or policy) that might lead to increasing number of kids with trust issues and psychological problems. This statement is expressing its disapproval in an exaggerated manner to ridicule the outcome of the criticized action or policy.\n\nOn the other hand, statement (B) \"Because this world needs more kids with trust issues and psychological problems than we already have!\" seems to literally state that the world needs more kids with psychological problems. However, just like its counterpart, the statement is most likely being put forth sarcastically with the speaker not truly meaning what the words literally suggest.\n\nComparing these two statements, statement (B) seems more sarcastic because it uses irony more directly by suggesting something ridiculous (that the world needs more troubled kids) to mock something else, most likely a cause of these issues. Statement (A) can also show sarcasm, but it is not as direct or as typical of sarcasm as statement (B).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the more sarcastic statement is:\n\n(B)",

It is oftentimes characterized by tone of voice, which is difficult to express using mere text. \n\nStatement (A) - \"You mean Knuth up arrow notation isn't unfamiliar for you?\" is an example of a potentially sarcastic remark. It implies that the speaker is surprised that the person they're addressing is familiar with the Knuth up arrow notation. The tone could be interpreted as sarcastic by implying that the subject should be more commonly known than it is, as it minimizes the achievement of the one who knows it.\n\nStatement (B) - \"You mean Knuth up arrow notation isn't normal for you?\" This statement seems to insinuate that the speaker finds it odd that Knuth up arrow notation may not be 'normal' for the person they're speaking to. It's a less definitely sarcastic statement, as it does not belittle or ridicule the person being spoken to. It seems to be more of a straightforward question, assuming that it is normal for them.\n\nGiven these interpretations, statement (A) appears to be the more sarcastic comment as it could be intending to make fun of another person's unfamiliarity with a subject.\n\nSo, the answer is (A).",

It's often used to say the opposite of what you actually mean.\n\nTaking a look at the options, \n(A) suggests that it will get warmer over the next couple of weeks when it's the beginning of winter. This contradicts the known pattern of weather because typically it gets colder as winter progress.\n(B) suggests that it will get warmer over the next couple of weeks when it's the end of winter. This aligns with the known weather patterns because after winter, usually, spring follows which corresponds to warmer weather.\n\nAmong these two options, (A) contradicts what is typically expected from the weather during winter - which is it getting colder and not warmer. Therefore, one could say that statement (A) expresses a sarcastic sentiment because it says the opposite of what is expected to happen.\n\nNow looking at (B), it aligns more with the known fact about weather changes i.e. warmer weather typically follows the end of winter. Therefore, it doesn't express a sarcastic sentiment since it doesn't contradict what is typically expected to happen.\n\nHence, the sarcaustic statement is option (A).\n\n(A)",

The speaker isn't stating something contrary to the expected or agreed-upon belief.

The speaker is not insinuating or implying anything contrary to what's commonly believed.\n\n(B) Sneaking out of a government facility with dangerous contraband isn't going to be illegal.\n\nNow, this is a sarcastic statement. It's generally expected that sneaking out of a government facility, especially with contraband, is illegal, and the speaker is stating the opposite, thus implying sarcasm. The fact that it is illegal is such a given that saying it's not illegal comes across as sarcastic, as the speaker is stating the opposite of the truth to mock or ridicule the scenario.\n\nSo, the sarcastic statement is (B) Sneaking out of a government facility with dangerous contraband isn't going to be illegal.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

A sarcastic statement often means the opposite of what it is literally saying.\n\nA. \"Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight years ago\"\nSince there's economic inflation with time, this statement is ironic because it suggests that things should be cheaper in the present than they were eight years ago, when in reality, the prices of most things generally tend to increase over time. So this statement seems sarcastic.\n\nB. \"Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight days ago\"\nThis statement does not have any inherent irony, as the price of things don't usually increase significantly in a period of eight days, and so, the statement could very well be true. Thus, it doesn't seem to be sarcastic.\n\nGiven these analyses, we can conclude that the sarcastic statement is likely the one that goes against what we would typically expect based on societal norms or general observations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight years ago.",

A \"troll\" in online or colloquial terms refers to someone who deliberately instigates or causes disruption or quarrels on the internet. The irony and sarcasm lie in the fact that trolls are not a species, let alone an endangered one, and feeding them (which commonly means responding to their disruptions and quarrels, giving them what they want) is typically discouraged.\n\nSo, the sarcastic statement here is (B) You're welcome my dear friend.
