This means the falcon is not the first bird from the left.\n\nSecond, it was indicated that the blue jay is to the right of the quail. This means that the blue jay is also not the first bird from the left, but it also means that it is not the bird at the far right either because that's where the falcon is.\n\nBy comparing these positions, we can narrow down the positions of the birds on the branch. The branch from left to right must be holding the quail, the blue jay, and the falcon respectively.\n\nSo, the blue jay is the middle bird, making it second from the left, meaning the answer is (A) The blue jay is the second from the left.",

So Amy is definitely not the last, but she can be the first or second. Eve is definitely not the first because she finished below Amy.\n\nLooking at the second statement, \"Eve finished above Joe,\" means that Joe had a worse finish than Eve. So Joe is definitely not the first or the second, but the last. Since Joe is last and Eve is not first, the only position left for Eve is second. \n\nTherefore, the order of finish from first to last is Amy, Eve, Joe. \n\nSo, the answer is: \n(C) Amy finished first.",
