But she was seen driving to the water park between 7am and 11am, so she could not have gone to the coffee shop during this time. This rules out option (B) - Susan was busy during this time and could not have gone to the coffee shop.\n\nNext, John saw Susan buying clothes at the mall from 11am to 12pm, so she was busy during this hour as well. \n\nFrom 12pm to 1pm, Susan was seen taking photos near the Eiffel Tower, ruling out this time period for her coffee shop visit.\n\nThen, Steven saw Susan buying lunch at the deli from 1pm to 2pm, meaning she couldn't have gone to the coffee shop during this hour. This lets us rule out option (C) - Susan was busy during this time and could not have gone to the coffee shop.\n\n2pm to 6pm Susan was seen reading at the library, so this can't be the time Susan went to the coffee shop. This rules out option (D) - Susan was busy during this time and could not have gone to the coffee shop.\n\nFinally, we know that the coffee shop closed after 9pm, so Susan must have visited the shop before it closed.\n\nThe only option that accommodates all of these known activities and the coffee shop's hours is (A) 6pm to 9pm. Before 6 pm,interval Susan was busy with other activities. And she had chance to visit the coffee shop before it closed at 9pm.\n\nAnswer:\n(A) 6pm to 9pm.",

            "model_answer": "First, we have to examine William's timeline. We know he woke up at 9am, but immediately after that, we know he was playing tennis from 9am-11am. This means that Option (B) is not possible because he was occupied during that time.\n\nNext, after his tennis match, he was in class from 11am-1pm, indicating that Option (C) is not possible either. \n\nFollowing his class, he was seen next at 6pm walking in the garden and was doing so until 7pm, meaning that Option (A) is also out of contention.\n\nHowever, there is a gap from 1pm to 6pm where we don't really know what he was doing, meaning it's possible he could have gone to the coffee shop during this time. \n\nSince the coffee shop closes at 7pm and he was seen at the garden from 6pm to 7pm, the only available time slot left for William to visit the coffee shop, based on the options given, is from 1pm to 6pm.\n\nSo the answer is: \n\n(D) 1pm to 6pm.",
