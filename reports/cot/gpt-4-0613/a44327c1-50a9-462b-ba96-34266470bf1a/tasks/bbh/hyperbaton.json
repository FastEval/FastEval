The rule is opinion, size, physical quality, shape, age, colour, origin, material, type and purpose.\n\n2.

The \"big\" and \"mysterious\" are reversed in order. \n\nB) \"big smoking mysterious Indian iron motorcycle\"\n- Order: Size(big) - Purpose(smoking) - Opinion(mysterious) -  Origin(Indian) - Material(iron) \n- Similarly, no Physical Quality, Shape, Age, and Colour mentioned in this sentence. \n- However, \"Big\" is a size, \"smoking\" is a purpose, \"mysterious\" is an opinion, \"Indian\" represents the origin, and \"iron\" tells about the material.\n- As in this sentence, \"big\" comes before \"mysterious,\" it is more correctly ordered than option A, but not perfectly correct as \"smoking\" is out of place.\n\n3. Consider our findings from step 2. Neither of the sentences adhere to the correct adjective order perfectly, but option B follows the order more closely than option A. \n\n4.

            "model_answer": "In English, adjectives generally follow a specific order when used together. This order is much like a rule which usually is as follows:\n\n1. Quantity or number \n2. Quality or opinion \n3. Size \n4. Age \n5. Shape \n6. Color \n7. Proper adjective (often nationality, or other place of origin)\n8. Purpose or qualifier.\n\nThe two sentences provided are:\n\n(A) new white lead walking surfboard\n(B) walking lead new white surfboard\n\nWe need to choose the sentence that adheres most closely to the adjective order rule. To do this, let's break down each sentence using the adjective rule to understand where each adjective falls.\n\n(A) \n- New: Age\n- White: Color\n- Lead: Proper adjective \n- Walking: Purpose \n\nThis sentence seems to follow the order relatively well. The only discrepancy might be \"lead\", which could count as a 'material', which usually follows 'color' but is ahead here.\n\n(B) \n- Walking: Purpose \n- Lead: Proper adjective \n- New: Age\n- White: Color \n\nThis sentence does not follow the rule at all. 'Walking' which should typically come last, is first in the sentence. The age adjective 'new' which usually comes before \u2018color\u2019, is after it here.\n\nFrom the above analysis, it seems sentence (A) follows the adjective order more closely than sentence (B).\n\nSo, the answer is (A).",

According to the adjective order rule, quality or opinion should come before age. Therefore, \"mysterious ancient\" is the correct sequence, not \"ancient mysterious\".\n\nSo, based on the standard order of adjectives in English grammar, we can conclude that:\n\n(B) mysterious ancient yellow walking cat\n\nis the correct sentence.\n\nAnswer: (B)",
