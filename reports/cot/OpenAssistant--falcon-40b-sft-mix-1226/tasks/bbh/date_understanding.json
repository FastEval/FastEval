We can do this by subtracting 7 days from the current date using the `date()` function's built-in date manipulation capabilities:\n```\n<?php\n\n$today = date('m/d/Y');\n$weekAgo = date('m/d/Y', strtotime('-7 days'));\necho \"One week ago was: $weekAgo\";\n\n?>\n```\nThis will output the date one week ago, which we can then compare to the available answer choices to determine the correct answer.\n\nNow that we have the date one week ago, we can compare it to the available answer choices to determine the correct answer. The answer choices are:\n\n* (A) 05/23/2020\n* (B) 04/13/2021\n* (C) 05/24/2021\n* (D) 05/23/2054\n* (E) 05/23/1940\n* (F) 05/23/2021\n\nSince (F) is the only answer choice that matches the date we calculated one week ago (05/16/2021), the correct answer is (F).\n\nSo the final answer is (F) with parentheses around it: 05/23/2021.",

Today is February 5th, 2021, which means 2021-2020 = 1 year has passed.\n\nThus, to find out how many days have passed between today and March 20th, 2020, we need to subtract the number of days in 2020 from 365 to find the total number of days passed. 365 days - 176 days = 189 days passed between today and March 20th, 2020.\n\nFinally, since we are finding the date one week ago, we need to subtract another 7 from the number of days passed, which would be 189 days - 7 days = 182 days.
