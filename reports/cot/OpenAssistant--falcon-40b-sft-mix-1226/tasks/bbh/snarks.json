The customary/expected meaning of such a statement is likely for someone to follow their instincts and fight for what is right, as morality and justice may not always line up with power and regimentation.\n\nThe intended effect of (B) is to say that one should fight on their own terms, which may align with (A) on the surface, but since (A) is sarcastic, the intended effect (defeat) is baked into the semantics of the statement, so it will likely result in defeat.
