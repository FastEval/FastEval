This is because the rightmost book is located on the right, and the red book is the rightmost. Furthermore, the blue book is also located to the right of the green book. This is because the second sentence states that \"The blue book is to the right of the green book.\" Therefore, option B (\"The red book is the rightmost\") is false.\n\nLet's analyze statement two: \"The blue book is to the right of the green book.\" We know from statement one that the red book is located to the right of the green book.
