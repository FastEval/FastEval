            "model_answer": "(A) To determine the correct adjective order in this sentence, we need to follow the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the noun in the sentence. In this case, it is \"square Congolese.\"\n\nStep 2: Consider the type of adjective. We have two adjectives in this sentence: \"square\" and \"old-fashioned.\" The adjective \"square\" describes the noun \"Congolese\" and is therefore a restrictive adjective. It limits the set of objects being referred to. \"Old-fashioned\" is a descriptive adjective and provides additional information about the noun \"square Congolese.\"\n\nStep 3: According to the grammar rules of English, when the adjectives are in different orders, the order in which they normally come is: (i) size, (ii) age, (iii) shape, (iv) color, (v) origin, and (vi) material. In this case, we have two shape attributes: \"square\" and \"old-fashioned.\" As we already determined that we are dealing with a restrictive adjective, then \"square\" should come first. This means that the label of the shape should come first.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the correct order is (A).",
