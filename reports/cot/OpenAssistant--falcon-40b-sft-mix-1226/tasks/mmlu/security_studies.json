            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

Statement (A) highlights the interconnectedness of the global economy and the importance of energy security for all, suggesting a desire for continued liberalization and free-market trading.\n\nStatements (C) and (D) are more focused on the potential for geopolitical conflict over energy resources. While both statements recognize the importance of energy for the global order, they emphasize the unequal distribution of wealth and power rather than focusing on liberal economic principles.\n\nStatement (B), on the other hand, suggests that energy scarcity is likely to lead to disruptions in the global system and possibly the emergence of a new international energy order characterized by statism and neo-mercantilism. This perspective views energy security as a matter of national and state-level interests rather than global liberalization, which is more in line with a liberal perspective on energy security.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

            "model_answer": "Based on the given information, here is a possible step-by-step answer:\n\nThe US government has responded to the threat of TNC by influencing the construction of governmental responses worldwide. The US war on drugs emphasizes bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement and the use of sticks to induce states to increase their regulation and enforcement against TNC. Additionally, the focus has been on targeting individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime rather than the criminal markets themselves. The expansion of TNC in the 1990s led to an increase in police capacity and networking, along with an increase in information sharing between countries. Moreover, the increasing perception that TNC represents a national security threat has led to the militarization of law enforcement, with the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated.\n(D) Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated.

The institutional blurring between universities, think tanks, and policy has resulted in policy mergers at every level.\n\n(D) refers to the increasingly blurred lines between think tanks and the policy-making sphere.

While securing oil resources in the region may be one objective, it may not be the only one. Therefore, we cannot conclude that this option is sufficient to represent the broader strategy.\n\nOption (B) includes all the options, but it is a combination of multiple strategies, not a single strategy. The USA has adopted several approaches, including military interventions, partnerships with friendly governments, and diplomatic negotiations, to achieve its energy security goals.\n\nOption (C) highlights the USA's attempts to assert its primacy in the region through various interventions. While this may be a component of its energy security strategy, it does not encompass all aspects of the strategy.\n\nOption (D) focuses on the USA's efforts to stabilize oil-rich friendly political actors and maintain the status quo. This aligns with the broader strategy of ensuring reliable access to energy resources. However, it does not fully capture the USA's approach.\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can conclude that the USA's strategy towards energy security involves a combination of multiple approaches, including military interventions, partnerships with friendly governments, diplomatic negotiations, and stabilizing oil-rich friendly political actors.
