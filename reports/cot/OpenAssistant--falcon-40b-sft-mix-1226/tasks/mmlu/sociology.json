            "model_answer": "The mass-society theory suggests that the subordinate classes are dominated by the ideology of the ruling class (B). According to this theory, the media are controlled by the ruling class and they use it to propagate their ideology to the subordinate classes who are seen as vulnerable and passive consumers. The content of the media is influenced by the market forces, but it ultimately serves the interests of the ruling class (A). The notion that the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers is not necessarily true as people have the ability to critically engage with media messages and make their own interpretations (C). The audiences may not always be passive and can actively participate in the communication process (D). Therefore, the answer is (B).",

            "question": "The middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century were:\n\n(A) an urban set, involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations\n(B) too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness\n(C) often involved in 'white collar' work\n(D) all of the above",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first consider how the 19th century in particular contributed to the development of middle-class groups. Option (A) suggests that the middle classes were in contact with civic bodies and voluntary associations, which implies that they were active in civic life. This is likely true, as the 19th century saw an increase in urbanization and the growth of cities, which allowed for the development of new civic organizations.\n\nSimilarly, option (D) suggests that the middle classes were involved in a wide range of professions, including white-collar work, which was likely true considering the increasing importance of the service sector and the growth of the administrative and commercial professions.\n\nTherefore, both options (A) and (D) are likely true statements about the 19th century middle classes. This means that they were likely both 'involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations' and 'often involved in \"white collar\" work'.\n\nOption (B) suggests that the 19th century middle classes were too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness. This may have been true for some members of the middle classes, but it is unlikely to be true for all members. In fact, the rise of social movements and labor unions in the 19th century suggests that some members of the middle classes did develop a strong sense of class consciousness.\n\nOption (C) suggests that the 19th century middle classes were often involved in 'white collar' work. As mentioned above, this is likely true, but it is not exclusive to the 19th century middle classes. Therefore, this option does not add any new information to what we already know about the middle classes.\n\nBased on the information provided in the options, the best answer to this question is option (D) as it provides the most information about the 19th century middle classes.",

Electronic tagging reduces the need for prisons and thus can help with overcrowding, but it is not directly related to technological forms of surveillance.\n\nC. Technological forms of surveillance can make it easier to monitor employees' activities, but this does not necessarily result in the exchange of private information about consumers.\n\nAfter analyzing the choices, the answer is D.

The term was coined by \u00c9mile Durkheim.\n\n(B) mechanical solidarity is somewhat similar in concept to T\u00f6nnies' Gemeinschaft, but with an important distinction. While T\u00f6nnies sees Gemeinschaft as emerging from cooperation through participation, mechanical solidarity is treated as a static quality arising from simple similarity.\n\n\"Gesellschaft\" is the German word for \"society\". The term \"Gemeinschaft\" roughly translates to \"community\", though treated as a static quality arising from simple similarity.\n\n\"Anomie\" typically refers to the condition of social disintegration arising from a breakdown of social norms.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "I would start out by explaining that John Scott is suggesting that the traditional view of the 'managerial revolution' is flawed and that it can be argued that the owners of businesses still maintain significant control over their companies. Support for this comes from his assertion (A) that owners exercise control through groups of shareholders and interlocking directorships. This implies that the owners are still able to exert influence over the company's management and strategic direction, despite the separation of ownership and management functions.\n\nNext, I would consider whether Scott believes that managers are frustrated with their working conditions and planning a revolution to overthrow the owners. Support for this comes from the suggestion (D) that managers are becoming dissatisfied with their working conditions and planning to overthrow the owners of businesses. However, it is important to note that Scott does not explicitly state that a revolution is imminent, but rather that managers are unhappy with their current conditions and may be planning a change.\n\nBased on the information provided, I would conclude that John Scott's argument is that the 'managerial revolution' has not fully occurred, as traditional power structures within businesses remain intact. Owners are still able to exercise control through shareholders and interlocking directorships, managers are restive but not actively planning a revolt, and scientific management has been deemed inefficient. Therefore, the answer to this question is (B) ownership and management are becoming increasingly separate functions.",

Marxist feminists argue that patriarchy is rooted in the social relations of production, where the capitalist economy is based on the exploitation of women's domestic labor and the subordination of women within the family unit.
