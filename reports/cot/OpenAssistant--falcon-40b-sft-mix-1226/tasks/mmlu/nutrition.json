            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "When considering the impact of a disease within a population, there are multiple factors that can affect its prevalence.\n\nOption (A) mentions an increase in the incidence rate, which refers to the number of new cases of the disease in a given time period. A decrease in incidence rate can occur due to various reasons, such as vaccination, better prevention measures, or a decline in the population at risk. However, if the incidence rate falls, and all other factors remain constant, it would imply that fewer people are acquiring the disease, which could lead to a decrease in prevalence over time.\n\nOption (B) refers to a longer survival time, meaning that the time from infection to recovery or death is drawn out. In this case, the number of people with the disease at a given time would increase, leading to a higher prevalence.\n\nOption (C) suggests an improvement in recovery from the disease, which would imply that people who are already infected would be able to recover faster. This would result in a lower number of people with the disease in the population, leading to a decrease in prevalence.\n\nOption (D) speaks of an increase in the overall population size. This can lead to a higher prevalence of the disease if all other factors remain constant. However, it does not necessarily imply an increase in the incidence rate.\n\nIn conclusion, out of the given options, only the third one (C) leads to a decrease in prevalence when all other factors remain constant.",

This statement is correct as flavonoids and isoflavonoids are both polyphenolic compounds with a similar structure and function. Flavonoids are a large group of plant pigments responsible for the yellow, red, and blue colors of many fruits, vegetables, and flowers, while isoflavonoids are a subgroup of flavonoids that are specific to some leguminous plants like soybeans. Therefore, both flavonoids and isoflavonoids belong to the flavonoid class.\n\n(B) and (C) are not related to the flavonoid class and (D) is incorrect as carotenoids do not belong to the polyphenol class but are another class of plant pigments.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Apologies, I did not include an explanation.\n\n`(A) Increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary life-style` both contribute to obesity. Increased energy density makes it easier to overconsume while a more sedentary lifestyle means we expend less energy. Together they contribute to weight gain.\n\n`(B) Decreased leisure time activity` likely causes obesity in cases where people are exercising less or none, but in many cases it is because people are spending more time sedentary through working in offices, watching television, or playing video games.\n\n`(C) Changes in genetic profiles` likely causes obesity in cases where people are genetically predisposed to be heavier and do not take in enough calories to negate this fact or exercise enough to inactivate the obesity genes. However in most cases it is unlikely to be the primary cause of obesity because only 1.7% of cancers can be inhered from parents compared to the 70% cancer incidence.\n\n`(D) None of the options given is correct` isn't accurate.",

However, older adults are particularly susceptible to vitamin B12 deficiency due to various factors.\n\nReduced secretion of intrinsic factor (Answer A) can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency as intrinsic factor is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 from food in the gastrointestinal tract. Atrophic gastritis (Answer B) is a chronic inflammation of the stomach that can reduce the production of intrinsic factor. Helicobacter pylori infection (Answer C) is a common bacterial infection of the stomach that can cause atrophic gastritis and reduce the absorption of vitamin B12.\n\nTherefore, all of the above factors, namely reduced secretion of intrinsic factor, atrophic gastritis, and Helicobacter pylori infection, contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Vitamin D is required for calcium absorption from the small intestine.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Vitamin D helps the small intestine absorb calcium from food. It does so by increasing the production of calcium-binding proteins in the small intestine, which bind to calcium and facilitate its absorption into the bloodstream.\n* Vitamin A, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K are important for many functions in the body, including vision, immunity, and blood clotting, but they are not specifically required for calcium absorption from the small intestine.\n* So, the correct answer is (B) Vitamin D.",

            "model_answer": "(C) The metabolic demand involves consumption of amino-acids by a number of irreversible pathways and these are either obligatory or adaptive.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe metabolic demand for amino acids is the amount of amino acids required by an organism to maintain normal physiological function. This demand is met through a combination of de novo synthesis, dietary intake, and breakdown of proteins within the body.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the metabolic demand for amino acids can be met through both dietary intake and de novo synthesis within the body.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because protein turnover refers to the ongoing process of protein synthesis and degradation within the body, rather than the metabolic demand for amino acids.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the metabolic demand for amino acids is not a fixed amount, but rather varies depending on various factors such as age, body weight, and level of physical activity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) which states that the metabolic demand involves consumption of amino acids by a number of irreversible pathways and these are either obligatory or adaptive. Obligatory pathways are those that are essential for survival and cannot be bypassed, while adaptive pathways are those that are activated in response to specific environmental or physiological conditions.",
