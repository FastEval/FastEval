            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) It illuminates the concept of a rule.\n\nExplanation:\n\nH.L.A. Hart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation' is a core concept in his legal philosophy, and it helps to clarify the meaning of legal rules. By defining these two terms, Hart aims to show how legal rules function and how they relate to moral and political values.\n\n(A) It demonstrates the difference between the internal and the external aspect of a rule.\n\nWhile Hart's distinction does touch on the internal and external aspects of legal rules, it goes beyond this point. The internal aspect refers to the rule itself, whereas the external aspect concerns the application of the rule by the legal system. However, Hart's distinction is not solely about this difference; it has a broader scope.\n\n(B) It refutes the natural lawyer' view of the role of morality in law.\n\nThis statement is not entirely accurate. While Hart's distinction does challenge some aspects of natural law theory, it is not specifically aimed at refuting it. Instead, Hart's philosophy is focused on developing a unique understanding of legal rules and their relationship to morality and justice.\n\n(C) It explains the nature of power-conferring rules.\n\nHart's distinction does not directly address power-conferring rules. Power-conferring rules are legal norms that give individuals or institutions the authority to make decisions or take actions. While Hart's theory discusses the application of legal rules by the legal system, it does not focus specifically on the nature of power-conferring rules.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(D) It illuminates the concept of a rule.\n\nHart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation' helps to clarify what a legal rule is, how it functions, and how it relates to other elements of the legal system. By shedding light on these aspects, Hart's theory provides a valuable framework for understanding the nature of legal rules.",

            "question": "Maine's famous aphorism that 'the movement of progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract' is often misunderstood. In what way?\n\n(A) It is misinterpreted as a prediction.\n(B) His concept of status is misrepresented.\n(C) It is taken literally.\n(D) His idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "I suspect Maine's famous aphorism is misunderstood in the sense that his concept of status is misrepresented. To answer your question, I would walk you through the following steps:\n\nFirst, let's look at Maine's famous aphorism: \"The movement of progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract.\" Maine explains in his book \"Ancient Law\" that this statement does not mean that all societies necessarily evolve from status to contract, but rather that those that do move from a predominantly status-based legal system to a contractual one are considered \"progressive.\" It's a descriptive, rather than prescriptive, statement that aims to observe a pattern he has noticed in certain societies.\n\nOne way in which Maine's aphorism can be misunderstood is by mischaracterizing his concept of status. In many discussions, people use the term \"status\" interchangeably with \"hierarchy\" or \"rank.\" However, Maine uses the word \"status\" in a specific way that requires a careful definition:\n\nAccording to Maine, in status-based legal systems, individuals have pre-assigned rights, duties, privileges, and liabilities that are determined by their place within a particular social group or class. These rights, duties, privileges, and liabilities are traditionally recognized, endorsed, and enforced by custom rather than by written law or other formal means. Benjamin Constant further adds that in status-based legal systems, \u201cthe law is not the same for all, but is different for each individual; it is the inheritance that one receives from his ancestors, the gift of his tribe, the privilege of his caste or his profession. One does not acquire it and one can neither lose it nor abdicate it.\u201d (Benjamin Constant, Principles of Political Economy, trans. Edward de Paramo (New York: Huebsch, 1927), 6.)\n\nNow, let's look at contract-based legal systems that Maine contends are more modern. In these systems, individuals are capable of entering into legally binding agreements that determine their rights, duties, privileges, and liabilities. These agreements are typically made in writing and are enforceable through courts if necessary.\n\nTherefore, to understand Maine's aphorism, it's essential to consider how he defines the term \"status.\" In Maine's view, a movement from a predominantly status-based legal system to a contractual one does not necessarily imply progress on a moral or ethical level, but rather a change in the legal mechanism that governs social and economic interactions among individuals.\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems that Maine's famous aphorism is often misunderstood in the sense that his concept of status is misrepresented.",

            "question": "Which of the following factors contributed significantly to the revival of natural law in the 20th century?\n\n(A) Depression of the 1930\n(B) The rise of Fascism\n(C) The international recognition of human rights after World War II\n(D) The Bolshevik Revolution",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "When analyzing the possible factors that contributed to the revival of natural law in the 20th century, we must first define what natural law is and the context in which it was revived.\n\nNatural law is a philosophy that holds that there are universal and immutable laws or principles that govern human behavior and societies, derived from nature or God. It has its roots in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy and has been a major source of moral and political philosophy throughout history.\n\nThe revival of natural law in the 20th century can be understood as a reaction against the dominant philosophical and political trends of the time, such as positivism, Marxism, and utilitarianism. It was part of a broader intellectual movement called the neo-scholastic revival or the new natural law theory, which sought to renew and update the tradition of natural law thinking in light of modern developments.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible factors that contributed to the revival of natural law:\n\n1. Depression of the 1930s: It is unlikely that the economic hardships of the Great Depression played a significant role in the revival of natural law. While economic crises can sometimes lead to a search for new ideas, the revival of natural law was a more intellectual and philosophical movement, rather than a direct response to economic problems.\n\n2. The rise of Fascism: While the rise of totalitarian regimes in the 20th century, such as Fascism, certainly prompted a concern for the protection of human rights and individual freedom, it is also unlikely that this was a direct cause of the revival of natural law. The new natural law theory emerged primarily from within the Catholic intellectual tradition and was influenced by thinkers such as Jacques Maritain and \u00c9tienne Gilson, who were concerned with the defense of human dignity and the common good, but not necessarily with opposing Fascism specifically.\n\n3. The international recognition of human rights after World War II: The adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations in 1948 was certainly a significant event in the history of human rights, but it is unlikely to be the main cause of the revival of natural law. The new natural law theory emerged before the adoption of the Declaration and was motivated by a concern for the philosophical and theological foundations of human rights, rather than simply their recognition and protection.\n\n4. The Bolshevik Revolution: The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in 1917 and the spread of Communism in Europe and elsewhere in the 20th century certainly prompted a concern for the protection of human rights and individual freedom, but it is also unlikely that this was the main cause of the revival of natural law. The new natural law theory emerged from within the Catholic intellectual tradition and was influenced by concerns about the role of morality and religion in public life, which were not necessarily directly related to the threat of Communism.\n\nTherefore, the most likely factor that contributed significantly to the revival of natural law in the 20th century is:\n\n(C) The international recognition of human rights after World War II\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the revival of natural law was a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, with various intellectual, philosophical, and theological motivations, and that no single factor can fully explain it.",

After analysing the options, I suggest the following steps before making a decision:\n\n1. To clarify the meaning of the distinction between the grand and formal styles of legal reasoning, read an explanation by Llewellym such as \"The Grand Style of Reasoning\" (https://jstor.org/stable/2339715). Then re-read the criticism options, paying special attention to their relationship to Llewellyn's distinction.\n2. Evaluate the basis of each criticism: Does it rest on a factual inaccuracy or logical flaw? For example, is it true that there are no differences in how judges reason? If so, which criticism relies on this assumption?\n3. Determine if any of the criticisms undercut the key features of Llewellyn's distinction. Consider whether the distinction is essential to the criticisms and what would happen if Llewellyn's ideas were removed from the legal system. For instance, would the criticisms still stand if the distinction were abandoned?\n4. I recommend revisiting the question one more time after considering the above steps.

            "model_answer": "To determine which proposition is most consistent with Rawls' idea of what the People behind the Original Position (POP) would choose regarding \"social primary goods,\" we should examine Rawls' theory of justice and the principles he establishes in his book \"A Theory of Justice.\"\n\nRawls' theory is based on the fundamental idea that rational individuals would support principles of justice that guarantee equal basic rights, equal liberties, and equality of opportunity when they are behind a \"veil of ignorance,\" where they do not know their own social or economic status. This theory provides the basis for the following two principles of justice:\n\n1. The Principle of Equal Liberty: Rawls argues that individuals in a just society should have the same basic rights and freedoms, regardless of their social or economic status.\n\n2. The Principle of Difference: According to this principle, inequalities in society are only justified if they benefit the least advantaged members of society.\n\nBased on these principles, we can now examine the four propositions provided:\n\n(A) The POP will choose wealth over a compassionate society. This option conflicts with Rawls' principles, as wealth is not considered a basic right or liberty in Rawls' theory. Therefore, the POP would not prioritize wealth over a compassionate society.\n\n(B) The POP will choose equality over power. This option is consistent with Rawls' principles, as both equality and power are considered basic rights and liberties in his theory. The POP would thus aim to create a society where both are equally valued.\n\n(C) The POP will be unselfish. This option is also consistent with Rawls' principles, as he emphasizes the importance of rational individuals acting in an unselfish manner. The POP would thus seek to create a society where individuals prioritize the well-being of others.\n\n(D) The POP will choose to protect the disabled. This option is also consistent with Rawls' principles, as the protection of vulnerable individuals is considered important in a just society. The POP would aim to create a society that ensures the well-being and equal treatment of all individuals, including the disabled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D): The POP will choose to protect the disabled.",

The fundamental power dynamic remains unchanged, i.e. rooted in the sex/gender binary as part of the patriarchy. It would therefore be more consistent with Catharine MacKinnon's argument for women to actively subvert the existing power structures, than merely to push for changes within them.\n(B) Equality is impossible because men define women as different.\n\nWhile it is true that men have historically defined women in opposition to themselves, this does not necessarily make equality impossible. Equality can be achieved by women securing their own representation, rather than relying on men to define their interests.\n(C) The idea of 'woman' needs to be redefined.\n\nThis proposition is consistent with Catharine MacKinnon's argument. The idea of 'woman' indeed needs to be redefined in order to break free from the limitations imposed by the patriarchy.\n(D) The world is phallocentric and oppressive.\n\nWhile this proposition may seem to directly contradict Catharine MacKinnon's argument by framing the situation in terms of patriarchy, it can actually be interpreted as consistent with her argument because it identifies the underlying power structures that need to be challenged.
