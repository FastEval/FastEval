The other two options, China (A) and the United States (B), are the current leaders in solar energy production, so we need to further analyze their data.\n\nThe latest data available for China's solar energy generation is from 2018, when China produced 143.4 GW of solar energy. The United States produced 55.2 GW of solar energy in 2018 and 2019 had an even higher installed capacity.\n\nBased on these recent data, the United States is the country that generated the most total energy from solar sources in 2019.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we should first make sure we understand what it is asking for. The question states that we should control for inflation and purchasing power parity (PPP) adjustments when calculating the increase in GDP per capita.\n\nNext, we should determine how to calculate GDP per capita. GDP per capita is typically calculated by dividing a country's total GDP by its total population.\n\nNow, we can follow these steps to answer the question:\n\n1. Calculate Japan's GDP per capita in 1950 and in 2016. We can do this by finding the GDP figures for each year and then dividing each year's GDP by the population at the time.\n2. Adjust the 2016 GDP per capita by the rate of inflation since 1950. We can do this by finding the inflation rate over this time period.\n3. Adjust the adjusted 2016 GDP per capita by PPP. We can do this by finding the PPP rate for Japan in 2016 and adjusting the 2016 GDP per capita by that rate.\n4. Compare the adjusted 2016 GDP per capita to the unadjusted 1950 GDP per capita. This will show us the increase in GDP per capita after controlling for inflation and PPP.\n\nBased on these steps, I think the correct answer is (B) by 10 fold.",

We know that as of 2017 internet penetration was low in Brazil and `(A)` still falls below that number. However, if we consider that the question aims for active internet use (which is likely, since the inclusion of past-three-months implies daily or at-least-weekly usage) instead of internet access, an `(A)`-answer could be achieved using `~11.9%`:\n\n1. Add people with an internet-enabled phone or tablet who only use them for offline media or calling. Although many of them would have 3G or similar, this does not mean they connect to the internet.\n2.

Count infants and toddlers who cannot access the internet as not using it.\n4. Both 46% and `22-49 * 42%` come from household surveys and as such we need to account for inaccuracies. About 42% of Brazilians stating not to have internet access in a SURVEY[^1]^[^2] however living in a household that does. Even accounting for such survey inaccuracies, `46%` probably still underestimates the number of non-internet-users.\n\nNow TLDR and how do we get to `(B) 38%`\n\n` TLDR `While the used method overestimates internet usage because infants and toddlers and overestimating household internet access, the correct answer is probably `(A)`: While smartphones are quite common among Brazilians, many do not use the internet on them due to smartphones being cheaper than basic plans (for which the current TLDR and question should hint at, or else it would be (B)) and people frequently requesting internet-tethering from non-internet-owners.\n`B TLDR `While almost half of Brazilians have home internet access, survey respondents do not always truthfully report non-internet access.
