In an undirected graph, a path can have up to two edges. Without self-loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself), there can be a maximum of two edges between any pair of vertices.\n\nWe know that in any graph with 10 nodes and 6 edges, there could be a maximum of two edges between any pair of vertices. Now, let us consider a graph with the maximum number of edges, i.e., at least two edges between every pair of vertices.\n\nIn such a graph, each node would be connected to at most 9 other nodes, and the maximum number of connected components would be one.\n\nOn the other hand, a graph with the minimum number of edges would have at most one edge between every pair of vertices. In such a graph, each node would be connected to at most one other node, and the minimum number of connected components would be one.\n\nHowever, there is an intermediate case where a graph has between one and two edges between each pair of vertices. In such a graph, the number of connected components could vary.\n\nNow, we can see that the maximum number of connected components for a graph with two edges between each pair of vertices is at most 2, as any graph with two edges between each pair of vertices can be split into two connected components with exactly two edges. However, the minimum number of connected components for a graph with two edges between each pair of vertices is also 2, as any graph with two edges between each pair of vertices can be split into two connected components with exactly one edge.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) M = 10, m = 1.",

First, it is mentioned that the information in the node includes the owner of the file, the count of the number of links to the tile, and the disk block numbers of the file.\n2.
