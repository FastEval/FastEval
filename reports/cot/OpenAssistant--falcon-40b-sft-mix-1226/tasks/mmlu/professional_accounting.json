            "question": "On July 1 year 7 Dean Co. issued at a premium bonds with a due date of July 1 year 12.

Bond carrying Retained amount earnings\n\n(A) Overstated Understated\n(B) Understated Overstated\n(C) Overstated No effect\n(D) No effect No effect",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to apply the effective interest method rather than the straight-line method to amortize the premium on the bond. This means that we need to recognize interest expense over the life of the bond at a higher rate than we would have under the straight-line method.\n\nThe effective interest method assumes that the company pays interest semi-annually at a constant rate over the life of the bond. To determine the interest expense for each semi-annual period, we must first calculate the coupon rate. The coupon rate is the annual interest rate stated on the bond. In this case, the bond has a due date of July 1 year 12, so it matures in 12 years.\n\nAssuming that the coupon rate is 6%, we can calculate the effective interest rate by using the semi-annual effective interest rate formula:\n\nEffective Interest Rate = (1/2) (Coupon Rate + 1/2 (1 - (1 + Effective Interest Rate) ^ (6 * 2)))\n\nwhere \"C\" is the stated coupon rate, \"r\" is the effective interest rate, and \"n\" is the number of semi-annual periods.\n\nLet's calculate the effective interest rate using this formula:\n\nEffective Interest Rate = (1/2) (0.06 + 1/2 (1 - (1 + Effective Interest Rate) ^ (6 * 2))))\n\nEffective Interest Rate = (1/2) (0.06 + 1/2 (1 - (1 + i) ^ (12 * 2))))\n\nEffective Interest Rate = (1/2) (0.06 + 1/2 (1 - (1 + 0.08) ^ (12 * 2))))\n\nEffective Interest Rate = (1/2) (0.06 + 1/2 (1 - (1 + 0.16) ^ (12 * 2))))\n\nEffective Interest Rate = (1/2) (0.06 + 1/2 (1 - (1 + 0.64) ^ (12 * 2))))\n\nEffective Interest Rate \u2248 0.160486918\n\nSince the coupon rate is 6%, we can round the effective interest rate to 16%.\n\nNow that we have calculated the effective interest rate for the bond, we can use it to determine the interest expense for each semi-annual period. We can do this by using the bond's par value and effective interest rate to calculate the present value of the bond's semiannual interest payments. We can then subtract the present value from the par value to get the interest expense for each period.\n\nAssuming that the bond's par value is $1,000, we can calculate the interest expense for each semi-annual period as follows:\n\nInterest Expense for Period 1 = [(PV of Semi-annual Interest Payments) - $1,000] / 2\n\nInterest Expense for Period 2 = [(PV of Semi-annual Interest Payments) - ($1,000 - Interest Expense for Period 1)] / 2\n\nInterest Expense for Period 3 = [(PV of Semi-annual Interest Payments) - ($1,000 - Interest Expense for Period 1 - Interest Expense for Period 2)] / 2\n\nInterest Expense for Period 4 = [(PV of Semi-annual Interest Payments) - ($1,000 - Interest Expense for Period 1 - Interest Expense for Period 2 - Interest Expense for Period 3)] / 2\n\nInterest Expense for Period 5 = [(PV of Semi-annual Interest Payments) - ($1,000 - Interest Expense for Period 1 - Interest Expense for Period 2 - Interest Expense for Period 3 - Interest Expense for Period 4)] / 2\n\nInterest Expense for Period 6 = [(PV of Semi-annual Interest Payments) - ($1,000 - Interest Expense for Period 1 - Interest Expense for Period 2 - Interest Expense for Period 3 - Interest Expense for Period 4 - Interest Expense for Period 5)] / 2\n\nInterest Expense for Period 7 = [(PV of Semi-annual Interest Payments) - ($1,000 - Interest Expense for Period 1 - Interest Expense for Period 2 - Interest Expense for Period 3 - Interest Expense for Period 4 - Interest Expense for Period 5 - Interest Expense for Period 6)] / 2\n\nWe can repeat this process for each semi-annual period to get the interest expense for the entire bond.\n\nNow that we have calculated the interest expense for each period, we can use this information to answer the question. To do this, we need to know if Dean Co. correctly or incorrectly amortized the premium. If they incorrectly amortized the premium, we need to find the error and correct it.\n\n(A) Overstated Earnings: If Dean Co. incorrectly amortized the premium and overstated earnings, the error would have occurred in Period 1. The present value of the bond's semiannual interest payments at the beginning of Period 1 would have been less than the par value.\n\nThe PV of Semi-annual Interest Payments for Period 1 would be less than $1,000 if Dean Co. used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method. In this case, the interest expense for Period 1 would be less than expected, which would overstate earnings.\n(B) Understated Earnings: If Dean Co. incorrectly amortized the premium and understated earnings, the error would have occurred in Period 6. The present value of the bond's semiannual interest payments at the beginning of Period 6 would have been greater than the par value.\n\nThe PV of Semi-annual Interest Payments for Period 6 would be greater than $1,000 if Dean Co. used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method. In this case, the interest expense for Period 6 would be more than expected, which would have understated earnings.\n(C) No Effect Earnings: If Dean Co. correctly amortized the premium, the effective interest method used to amortize the premium would have correctly matched the interest expense with the bond's carrying amount, resulting in no error in earnings.\n\nBased on our analysis above, Dean Co. had overstated earnings in period 1 if they incorrectly amortized the premium and used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method. This means that the correct answer is (A).",

During a tax year, the corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income and distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders. Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson\u2019s individual tax return.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine Carson's S corporation income, we need to calculate his share of the corporation's pre-dividend income, as well as the after-dividend income.\n\nFirst, we need to find out Carson's ownership percentage in the corporation. He owned 40/100, or 40%. Given that 40% of the outstanding stock was owned by Carson, the corporation was 40/100, or 40%., owned by other shareholders.\n\nNow, let's find out how much the corporation had in pre-dividend income. We start with the total amount of taxable income, $400,000, and subtract the amount of dividends distributed, $70,000. This gives us the pre-dividend income, which is $400,000 - $70,000 = $330,000.\n\nSince Carson owned 40% of the corporation's stock, he was entitled to 40/100, or 40%, of the pre-dividend income. This comes to 40/100 * $330,000 = $132,000.\n\nNow, we need to calculate Carson's after-dividend income. The corporation distributed a total of $70,000 in dividends. Since Carson owned 40% of the stock, he was entitled to 40/100 * $70,000 = $28,000 in dividends.\n\nGiven that Carson already reported $28,000 in dividends on his individual tax return, his after-dividend income is $132,000 - $28,000 = $104,000.\n\nFrom the above calculations, we conclude that Carson would have reported $104,000 in S corporation income, if the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $132,000.",
