            "model_answer": "It appears that the question is asking for the definition of \"justiciability\". Based on the given options, the term can be interpreted as:\n\n(A) - the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders. This means that if a particular right is seen as just and valid, it can be enforced through the judicial system.\n(B) - the just nature or cause of a particular right. This means that a right can be considered just and valid if it aligns with principles of fairness and justice.\n(C) - the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular right conforms to principles of justice. This means that the courts can decide whether a right is being justly enforced or not.\n(D) - Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular Right. This means that a particular right must be protected and enforced by the state in which it is recognized.\n\nBased on the definition, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n\nThis option is incorrect as R2P and humanitarian intervention are two distinct concepts. R2P is a principle developed by the UN General Assembly in 2005 that affirms that the international community has a responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. On the other hand, humanitarian intervention is a unilateral or multilateral military intervention into a sovereign state with the goal of protecting civilians from imminent and large-scale loss of life, suffering, or other forms of human rights abuses.\n\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n\nThese options are not relevant to the question.\n\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not\n\nThis option is also incorrect. R2P can involve armed force, but it can also take other forms such as diplomatic, political, or economic means. In contrast, humanitarian intervention typically involves military force. However, this is not an absolute requirement.",

The statement \"whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law\" suggests that unless something is explicitly forbidden by international law, States are free to do as they choose.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources:\n\nThe UK constitution is uncodified, meaning it is not contained in a single document or piece of legislation. Instead, it is derived from a number of sources, including Acts of Parliament, court judgments, and constitutional conventions.\n\nThe rights and powers of the monarch, the government, and the legislature are not set out in a single document, but rather in a range of sources that have developed over time. These sources include Acts of Parliament passed by the UK Parliament, judgments made by the courts, and constitutional conventions that have emerged over the years.\n\nWhile certain constitutional principles and institutions are established by statute, such as the Parliament Acts and the Human Rights Act, the UK constitution is not based solely on written documents. It is also shaped by unwritten constitutional conventions, such as the convention that the monarch will act on the advice of ministers.\n\nIn summary, the UK Constitution is based on a combination of written and unwritten sources, and cannot be found in any single document or piece of legislation. Therefore, the best answer would be (C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources.\n\nAnswer: (C) The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources.",

This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes\n(C) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute\n(D) It is an obligation which concerns solely international courts and tribunals",

            "model_answer": "Since the question is asking about the obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes, I would eliminate options (B) and (D) right off the bat as they do not indicate a strict requirement for the settlement of disputes.\n\nOption (A) mentions that there is a strict obligation to resolve disputes as soon as possible. While it is important to resolve disputes in a timely manner, international law does not require the immediate resolution of every dispute.\n\nOption (C) mentions that the peaceful settlement of disputes is a peremptory norm of international law, which means that it is a fundamental and unchangeable principle. However, it does not necessarily mean that all States have a legal obligation to uphold it in every given dispute.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I would choose option (C) as the correct answer. The obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes is a fundamental principle of international law, but it does not necessarily mean that all States have a legal obligation to uphold it in every given dispute.",

According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, it is a capacity of international law to apply norms and principles such as duties, obligations, and rights to entities other than States.\n3.
