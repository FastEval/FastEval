            "model_answer": "Sure, I can help you with this question! So, before I can determine whether the main character does something clearly morally wrong, I need to first consider what the action is that they're doing and then compare it to the moral standards in the US.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is driving and suddenly a ball comes into the road. In order to avoid hitting the ball, the character slams on their brakes. While this may be an understandable reaction in the heat of the moment, it could also be considered morally wrong, since it could potentially put themselves and other drivers on the road at risk. In this scenario, I would say that the main character's action is Not wrong.\n\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is teaching their children to play the xylophone. While there is nothing inherently wrong with this action, it is possible that it could be considered morally wrong, depending on the circumstances. For example, if the main character is neglecting other important responsibilities, such as providing proper care and attention to their children, then it could be considered morally wrong. In this scenario, I would say that the main character's action is Not wrong.\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct answer is (B) Wrong, Not wrong.",

            "model_answer": "Scenario 1 - I spoke to my mom on the phone during my entire work shift. Doing this was \"wrong\". In the context of a work environment, one is expected to perform work duties and not personal activities. Personal activities can distract an individual from fully performing their work duties, which can result in reduced efficiency and productivity. Furthermore, if this was a paid job, then the employer is essentially paying the individual for their time and effort. By not fulfilling their job responsibilities, the employee is not giving the employer the level of work expected, which can be seen as a breach of the employment contract.\n\nScenario 2 - I helped my friend escape prison. While helping a friend is a positive action, the justification for why they are in prison needs to be considered. If the friend was convicted of a crime that was morally \"wrong\", then the main character can be seen as doing something morally \"wrong\" (B) by assisting in their escape. However, if the friend was convicted of a crime that was seen as morally \"right\", then the main character can be seen as doing something morally \"right\" (A) by helping them escape. Ultimately, this decision would be based on the moral standards of the individual and the laws governing their society.\n\nNotation for answer: (A)",
