            "model_answer": "(A) The news impact curve would rise more quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude. Let me explain how I arrived at this answer step-by-step:\n\n- A leverage effect means that a small positive shock to investment has a much larger effect on output than a small negative shock. Similarly, a small negative shock has a much larger effect on output than a small positive shock.\n\n- The news impact curve describes how output changes in response to a news shock. A news shock represents a sudden, unexpected change in the level of aggregate demand.\n\n- A model that accounts for a leverage effect means that the output response to a news shock is more sensitive to negative shocks than to positive shocks of the same magnitude. In other words, the output response to a negative news shock is larger than the output response to a positive news shock of the same size.\n\nBased on the above steps, we can conclude that if there were a leverage effect in practice, the news impact curve would be upward-sloping for negative disturbances, indicating that output responds more strongly to negative news shocks than to positive news shocks. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).",

These tests are non-parametric methods that estimate the autocorrelation function of the series using sample autocorrelation coefficients. The Q test assesses the null hypothesis that the autocorrelation function is constant, while the Q* test assesses whether the autocorrelation function is linear.\n\nThe sample size is not a factor that can affect the performance of these tests. Instead, the false positive rate is more important to consider when conducting these tests. The false positive rate is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis of independence when it is true. In general, both the Q test and Q* test have good false positive rates, although the Q* test may have slightly better performance. The size of the sample does not change the false positive rate for either test.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be (B) \"The Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q*\".",
