            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "After performing a physical examination and reviewing the patient's medical history, it is likely that the most likely cause of the decreased sensation on the left thigh is (C) compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. The patient's symptoms, location of decreased sensation, and the fact that the sensation has improved slightly suggest this as the most probable diagnosis.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it appears likely that she is experiencing primary dysfunctional labor.\n\nPrimary dysfunctional labor is a condition in which a woman has strong contractions but the cervix does not dilate or the labor fails to progress. This can occur due to a variety of reasons such as ineffective contractions, cervical incompetence, or uterine inertia.\n\nIn this case, the patient has regular contractions but is experiencing weak contractions since she has received medication for pain. Additionally, her cervix is fully dilated but labor has not progressed further. These signs point to primary dysfunctional labor.\n\nHypotonic uterine dysfunction is another condition that can present with weak contractions but it is less likely to be the cause in this case as it is often accompanied by other symptoms such as a history of uterine surgery, uterine rupture, or uterine malformations.\n\nAnswer: C.",

            "question": "A 9-year-old boy is brought to the office by his parents for a well-child examination. The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.

            "model_answer": "Based on the patient's medical history and physical examination findings, he is at greatest risk for the complication of systemic hypertension.\n\nThe murmur and chest x-ray findings suggest left ventricular hypertrophy, which is often caused by hypertension. Systolic murmurs are typically heard in hypertension and are more commonly heard along the left sternal border. Weak femoral pulses and a radiofemoral delay may indicate peripheral arterial disease, which can also be a complication of hypertension. The patient's BMI is in the 25th percentile, which is considered a healthy weight for his age and height, but his blood pressure is abnormally high given his age. Medical studies have shown that hypertension in children and adolescents is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood. A hypertension diagnosis in this patient would require follow-up with a primary care provider, who would then monitor the patient's blood pressure and make recommendations for lifestyle modifications or medication management as needed.\n\nAnswer: (C) Systemic hypertension",

During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?\n\n(A) Median nerve at the wrist\n(B) Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm\n(C) Radial nerve at the forearm\n(D) Ulnar nerve at the elbow",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The most likely cause of the right hand numbness is entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist.\n\nThe patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), which is a condition in which the median nerve is compressed at the wrist. Symptoms include numbness and tingling in the ring and small fingers, weakness in hand grip, and a pain that radiates from the wrist to the forearm.\n\nThe median nerve is responsible for sensation to the thumb, index, middle, and half of the ring finger. It also supplies motor function to muscles in the thumb and wrist. The median nerve travels through the carpal tunnel, a narrow passageway in the wrist formed by ligaments and bones. If this tunnel becomes constricted or inflamed, it can cause pressure on the median nerve, resulting in CTS symptoms.\n\nThe patient's history of playing softball and using a computer may have contributed to the development of CTS. Repetitive hand movements, such as those involved in throwing a ball or typing, can put pressure on the median nerve and increase the risk of entrapment. The patient's occupation as a cashier also involves repetitive hand movements, which could have caused or worsened the condition.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of numbness, tingling, and decreased sensation in the right ring and small fingers, and the jolt of pain experienced with palpation of the right elbow, are all consistent with median nerve entrapment at the wrist. The patient's full muscle strength and normal vital signs suggest that the entrapment is not severe and may be treatable with conservative measures such as rest, physical therapy, and the use of splints or braces to relieve pressure on the nerve.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the right hand numbness is entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist.",

            "model_answer": "Reasons and Evaluation:\nAdvanced ovarian cancer metastatic to the liver is a serious condition and can cause significant pain and distress. The patient's pain rating of 1 to 2 on a 10-point scale indicates that her pain is relatively mild, but it is still a concern. The patient has a history of hypertension and major depressive disorder, which can also contribute to her symptoms.\n\nThe patient is taking oxycodone, hydrochlorothiazide, and fluoxetine for her cancer, hypertension, and depression, respectively. Oxycodone is an opioid analgesic used to manage pain, and the patient is already taking it at an appropriate dose (10 mg twice daily). Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic used to treat hypertension and can cause dizziness and weakness, but the patient's blood pressure is normal. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant used to treat major depressive disorder, but it can also cause dizziness and weakness.\n\nThe patient's BMI is 24, which is within a normal range. The son's concern about her not getting out of bed and crying all the time suggests that the patient may be experiencing significant distress.\n\nThe patient's examination shows a distended abdomen with moderate tenderness over the liver, which is consistent with her advanced ovarian cancer.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most appropriate next step in management would be to evaluate the patient's depression and assess for suicidal ideation. The patient's crying, sadness, and poor eye contact suggest that she may be experiencing depression. Additionally, the patient's history of cancer and hypertension can also contribute to her emotional distress and suicidal ideation.\n\nThe physician should reassure the patient that her symptoms are being taken seriously and arrange for appropriate mental health care, such as counseling or therapy, to address her depression. The physician should also assess the patient's risk of suicidal ideation and develop an appropriate plan to address any concerns. The physician should also monitor the patient's pain and manage it appropriately.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect as the patient's pain is already adequately managed with oxycodone. Option (C) is incorrect as the patient's cancer requires additional assessment and management, not treatment with dextroamphetamine. Option (D) is incorrect as the patient's oxycodone dosage is already appropriate and there is no indication to increase it.\n\nAnswer: (B)\n\n\"Assess for suicidal ideation\" is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient.",
