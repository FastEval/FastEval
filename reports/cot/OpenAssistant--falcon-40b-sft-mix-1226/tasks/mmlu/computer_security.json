            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Read the question and understand what is being asked.\n2. Evaluate the different styles of fuzzers mentioned in the options.\n3. Determine which fuzzer is most likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the program based on its design and functionality.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nA) Generational fuzzers generate inputs based on a seed and evolve them through mutations or other techniques, creating a large number of inputs to test a program. Generational fuzzers are more likely to explore different paths and cover a large portion of the codebase, but they may miss some areas or not explore all the code paths completely.\n\nB) Black-box fuzzers do not require any knowledge about the program's internal workings and use random inputs to test its functionality. Black-box fuzzers are less likely to explore every line of code in the program because they do not have any knowledge about the program's structure.\n\nC) White-box fuzzers have knowledge about the program's internal workings and can generate inputs based on that knowledge. White-box fuzzers are more likely to explore every line of code in the program because they can target specific areas or functionality.\n\nD) Mutation-based fuzzers generate inputs by making small changes to existing inputs and testing the modified inputs for vulnerabilities. Mutation-based fuzzers can cover a large portion of the codebase, but they may miss some areas or not explore all the code paths completely.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can conclude that White-box fuzzers are more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the program because they have knowledge about the program's internal workings and can generate inputs based on that knowledge.\n\nAnswer: (C) White-box fuzzers",

            "model_answer": "The TLS protocol is designed to protect against several types of attacks, including replay attacks and impersonation attacks.\n\nIn a replay attack, an attacker intercepts the traffic between a client and a server and later retransmits the intercepted traffic in an attempt to trick the client into performing an action that it has already performed. TLS provides protection against replay attacks by using sequence numbers and a MAC (Message Authentication Code) to ensure that each message can only be used once and has not been tampered with.\n\nIn an impersonation attack, an attacker pretends to be the server in order to trick the client into sending sensitive information to the attacker instead of the real server. TLS provides protection against impersonation attacks by using server authentication, where the server presents a valid certificate signed by a trusted CA (Certificate Authority), and the client verifies the certificate to ensure that it is authentic. Additionally, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is used to establish a shared secret key between the client and the server, which is used to encrypt the communication.\n\nBased on the information provided, options (A) and (C) are true, while options (B) and (D) are false.

What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",

            "model_answer": "The answer should be (C), the KDC sends a ticket to the client so that when the client requests access to a server the KDC sends a ticket to the client so that when the client requests access to a server the KDC sends a ticket to the client so that when the client requests access to a server the KDC can verify that the ticket is still valid. When an  expired ticket is detected the server refuses to authenticate the user.

            "question": "Consider the paper Native Client: A Sandbox for Portable, Untrusted x86 Native Code by Yee et al. Ben Bitdiddle notes that NaCl uses Intel x86 segmentation to ensure that the sandboxed module does not read or write memory outside its own data area, and does not execute instructions outside its own code. Ben thinks that with these restrictions alone, executing the sandboxed module must be safe; that is, he thinks validation is not needed. Ben is wrong. Circle the types of x86 machine instructions that the validator always forbids in sandboxed code. Please ignore trampoline and springboard code.\n\n(A) all instructions that modify segment state\n(B) all loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32\n(C) all indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable)\n(D) all indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable)",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to carefully read the given paper and understand the role of validation in the NaCl sandbox. Let us first read the paper and identify the instructions that the validator always forbids in sandboxed code.\n\nAccording to the paper, the NaCl sandbox uses Intel x86 segmentation to ensure that the sandboxed module does not read or write memory outside its own data area, and does not execute instructions outside its own code. The validator enforces this sandbox by examining the machine code of the sandboxed module and rejecting any instructions that violate these rules.\n\nFrom the given options, we can circle the types of x86 machine instructions that the validator always forbids in sandboxed code:\n- (B) all loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32: The NaCl sandbox uses a memory protection scheme that divides the virtual address space into 32-byte segments. This means that all virtual addresses must be a multiple of 32, which prevents memory accesses to addresses that are not 0 mod 32. If a sandboxed module tries to access an address that is not 0 mod 32, it would violate the sandbox rules, and the validator would reject the instruction.\n\n- (D) all indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable): Indirect jumps rely on a memory address stored in a register or variable to determine the target of a jump instruction. Since the sandboxed module is not allowed to access any memory addresses outside its own data area, it cannot use an indirect jump instruction to jump to a target address that is not within its own data area. The validator would reject any instruction that attempts to perform an indirect jump.\n\nHence, the answer is (B) and (D).",
