Next, we can observe that for x=1, the equation becomes e^x + x - 2 = 1 + 1 - 2, which is equivalent to e^x + x = 1.\n3. This means that the only other way for the equation to be satisfied for x in [0, 1] is for e^x to take a value of negative one, which has no real solutions.\n4. Therefore, the equation only has one real solution in the interval [0, 1], and this solution must be at x=0.\n5.

So we can focus on the cyclic groups of order 16.\n\nThere are 3 cyclic groups of order 16, namely Z/16Z, Z/4Z, and Z/2Z. Let G be an abelian group of order 16. We want to count the number of ways we can choose 4 elements from G such that their sum is the identity element.\n\nThere are 4 ways to choose 1 element from G, and since each element in G contributes exactly 1 choice, there are 4 * |G| ways to choose 1 element from G.\n\nThere are 2 ways to choose 2 elements from G, 1 way to choose 3 elements from G, and 1 way to choose 4 elements from G, so there are a total of 2 + 1 + 1 + |G| = 4|G| ways to choose 2, 3, or 4 elements from G.\n\nSince the sum of the elements we choose must equal the identity element, we have 4 choices for the first element, 2 choices for the second element, and 1 choice for the third and fourth elements.

Therefore, the position function s(t) can be represented as:\n\ns(t) = 2t - 2t^2\n\nWe want to find the time at which s(t) = 3, which means we want to solve for t in the above equation:\n\n3 = 2t - 2t^2\n\nNow we need to isolate t on one side of the equation.

Therefore, there are 2^2 = 4 possibilities for where points A and B can be chosen.\n\nNext, we can consider the two endpoints of the segment, since they are not part of the three smaller segments.
