            "model_answer": "Robertsonian translocation occurs at the ends of long arms of two chromosomes.\n\\\nExplanation:\n\n* Option (A) is incorrect because telomeres are the repetitive nucleotide sequences present at the ends of chromosomes, which serve as protective caps and do not play a role in translocations.\n* Option (B) is incorrect because centromeres are the regions of chromosomes that attach to spindle fibers during cell division and also do not play a role in translocations.\n* Option (C) is incorrect because histones are proteins that package DNA into nucleosomes and are present throughout the chromosome structure.\n* Option (D) is correct because Robertsonian translocations occur at the ends of the long arms of two chromosomes. This type of translocation results in the formation of a new chromosome by fusing the ends of two non-homologous chromosomes, typically the long arms.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The inheritance pattern of malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is determined by the genes involved in the disorder.\n\nMalignant hyperthermia is a disorder caused by a mutation in the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1) gene, which is located on chromosome 19. The RYR1 gene encodes a protein that plays a role in muscle contraction. Mutations in the RYR1 gene can cause the muscles to become abnormally stiff and rigid, leading to severe muscle cramps, rapid heart rate, high fever, and other symptoms of malignant hyperthermia.\n\nTo determine the pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia, we need to consider how the RYR1 gene is inherited. The RYR1 gene is autosomal and dominant, meaning that if a person inherits a mutated copy of the gene from one parent, they will develop the disorder. The gene is located on a non-sex chromosome, so it is not related to gender and affects both males and females equally.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) autosomal dominant.\n\nAnswer: (A) autosomal dominant.",

            "question": "Mapping of human chromosomes:\n\n(A) has been restricted to the sex chromosomes because of small family sizes\n(B) proceeded much more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available.\n(C) has determined that the number of linkage groups is about twice the number of chromosomes\n(D) has demonstrated that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To map the human chromosomes, geneticists have had to rely on DNA markers, which are short repeating sequences of nucleotides that are present throughout the genome. In order to map these markers onto chromosomes, geneticists first need to identify them and then determine their order within the chromosomes.\n\nTo accomplish this, geneticists have used DNA sequencing techniques to identify large numbers of DNA markers and determine their order on the chromosomes. This has been critical for mapping the human genome because, in contrast to bacteria and other prokaryotes, human DNA has few unique sequences that can be used as landmarks for mapping. As a result, geneticists have had to rely on a large number of DNA markers in order to make the mapping process more accurate.\n\nHowever, mapping DNA markers onto chromosomes is not an easy task. Family sizes can be small, and it can be difficult to distinguish between linked and unlinked markers. As a result, geneticists have relied on large numbers of DNA markers in order to increase the accuracy of their mapping efforts.\n\nFinally, geneticists have determined that there is roughly equal involvement of DNA in coding for genes. This is due to the fact that there are large regions of noncoding DNA in the human genome that have little or no functional significance. In addition, geneticists have also found that the number of linkage groups is about twice the number of chromosomes, which suggests that there are many small DNA segments that are linked to short regions of chromosomes.\n\nOverall, mapping the human chromosomes has been a difficult and complex task that has required large amounts of DNA sequence data and sophisticated genetic techniques. Although geneticists have made significant progress in recent years, much work remains to be done in order to fully understand the structure and function of the human genome.",

Nonsense mutations cause a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein product.\n\nTherefore, we can eliminate (D) silent mutations, (A) nonsense mutations, and (B) regulatory mutations, since these can't cause exon skipping.\n\nThe answer is (C) RNA processing mutations.",
