            "model_answer": "The degree of a field extension L over a field K is the smallest positive integer n such that all elements of L can be expressed as a finite linear combination of n elements of K with coefficients in K.\n\nTo find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, we can express each of the given elements as linear combinations of elements of Q. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Express sqrt(2) as a linear combination of elements of Q: sqrt(2) = (1 + sqrt(3))/2 = (1 + (1 + sqrt(-3))/2) = (1 + (1 + 3i)/2) = (1 + (3 - 3i)/2) = (1 + (3 + 1)/2) = (1 + 3)/2 = (2 + 1)*(3 - 1)/2 = (2 + 3)/2 = (2 + 1)*(3 + 1)/2 = (2 + 5)/2.\n\n2. Express sqrt(3) as a linear combination of elements of Q: sqrt(3) = (1 + sqrt(3))/2 = (1 + (1 + sqrt(3))/2) = (1 + (1 + 3i)/2) = (1 + (3 - 3i)/2) = (1 + (3 + 1)/2) = (1 + 3)/2 = (2 + 1)*(3 - 1)/2 = (2 + 3)/2 = (2 + 1)*(3 + 1)/2 = (2 + 5)/2.\n\n3. Express sqrt(18) as a linear combination of elements of Q: sqrt(18) = (1 + sqrt(3))/2 = (1 + (1 + sqrt(3))/2) = (1 + (1 + 3)*(1 + sqrt(9)))/2 = (1 + (3 - 3i)*(1 + sqrt(9)))/2 = (1 + (3 + 1)*(1 + sqrt(9)))/2.\n\nBy construction, we have shown that each element of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) can be written as a finite linear combination of elements of Q with coefficients in Q. Hence, the degree of this field extension over Q is 3, since each element can be expressed as a linear combination of 3 elements of Q. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) 4",
