            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Tcd.\n\nExplanation: To translate a sentence into predicate logic, we should first identify the subject (S) and the predicate (P) of the sentence, and then write the sentence using logical connectives and quantifiers. In this case, the sentence \"David teaches Chris\" can be translated as \"S teaches P\", where \"S\" represents \"David\", \"P\" represents \"Chris\", and \"teaches\" represents the predicate \"T\".\n\nBased on this information, we can represent the sentence in the form of a logical expression:\n\n(S teaches P) (T p q)\n\nWhere \"p\" and \"q\" represent additional statements that we need to keep in mind as we are trying to establish the truth value of the sentence.\n\nLet's go through each of the answer choices (A), (B), (C), and (D):\n\n(A) Tdc: In this option, the subject of the sentence is \"Chris\", the predicate is \"T\", and we are trying to say that \"Chris teaches\". However, the sentence does not say that \"Chris teaches\", it says that \"David teaches Chris\". This option does not accurately represent the given sentence.\n\n(B) Tcd: In this option, the subject of the sentence is \"David\", the predicate is \"T\", and we are trying to say that \"David teaches Chris\". This option accurately represents the given sentence and is the best translation into predicate logic.\n\n(C) Tcc: In this option, the subject of the sentence is \"Chris\", the predicate is \"T\", and we are trying to say that \"Chris teaches\". However, the sentence does not say that \"Chris teaches\", it says that \"David teaches Chris\". This option does not accurately represent the given sentence.\n\n(D) dTc: In this option, the subject of the sentence is \"David\", the predicate is \"dT\", and we are trying to say that \"David does teach Chris\". However, the sentence does not say that \"David does teach Chris\", it says that \"David teaches Chris\". This option does not accurately represent the given sentence.\n\nThus, the correct option is (B) Tcd.",
