            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Here's my reasoning for the answer:\n\nLet's start by evaluating the four given options one by one:\n\n(A) The brain size of hominids had not grown for more than a million years, making it difficult for babies to walk: It's true that brain size has not increased significantly in hominids for the last million years; however, this does not directly correlate with the difficulty for babies to walk. Brain size does not necessarily impact motor skills development, and walking is an ability acquired later in a child's development. This option does not provide a clear evolutionary solution.\n\n(B) It allowed for bipedalism and independence from the mother at an earlier age: This option provides a possible evolutionary solution. Bipedalism is a distinctive characteristic of modern humans and can be challenging for babies with a less developed motor system. The secondarily altricial condition may have facilitated early independence from the mother, allowing babies to start walking and exploring their surroundings earlier than in other primate species. This would have been an advantage for survival in an environment where early mobility was crucial.\n\n(C) It allowed for subsequent growth of the brain, since bipedalism had resulted in a narrowed birth canal in the female pelvis: While it is true that bipedalism resulted in a narrower birth canal, which can be a challenge for larger-brained babies, this option does not provide an evolutionary advantage. It would not have facilitated the growth of the brain since the brain size was already reaching maximum capacity a million years ago. This option conflicts with the initial statement that the brain size had not grown significantly in hominids for the last million years.\n\n(D) It allowed for growth of the brain to nearly adult size prior to birth, since bipedalism had resulted in a wider birth canal in the female pelvis: This option also provides a possible evolutionary solution. A wider birth canal would have facilitated the passage of babies with larger brain sizes, allowing for their early independence and survival. It may have also encouraged the growth of the brain to nearly adult size before birth, providing cognitive advantages for survival in the challenging postnatal environment.\n\nBased on my evaluation, the correct answer is:\n\nD) It allowed for growth of the brain to nearly adult size prior to birth, since bipedalism had resulted in a wider birth canal in the female pelvis.",
