We can use the fact that y = 24/2 to substitute it in.\n(12 * 2) = p\n24 = p\n\nThis means that p must be equal to 24 for this equation to be true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is p = 24.",

We know that the cost of four tickets is $112, so we can represent this as 4t = 112.\n\nNext, we can solve for the variable t by dividing each side of the equation by 4. This will give us t = 112 / 4 or t = 28.\n\nFinally, we can check our answer by verifying whether 4t = 112 is equivalent to 4 * t = 112.
