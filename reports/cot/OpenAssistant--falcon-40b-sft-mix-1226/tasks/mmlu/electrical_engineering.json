For oscillation to occur, the loop gain should be less than unity, meaning that the open-loop transfer function has a pole with a magnitude greater than one.\n\n(C) The phase of a feedback signal with respect to input should be 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0: This is not correct, as it does not ensure oscillation, although it is a necessary condition for the Barkhausen criterion to be met.\n\n(D) Both A and C are correct: This is correct.

            "model_answer": "(D) It does not load the circuit at all.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter because it does not load the circuit at all.\n\nIn this method, a potentiometer is connected in series with the circuit to be measured, and the voltage across the potentiometer is adjusted until the current through the circuit is balanced. This adjustment of the potentiometer changes the resistance in the circuit and allows for accurate measurement of the voltage drop across the circuit.\n\nSince the potentiometer does not draw any current from the circuit, it does not load the circuit, and the voltage drop across the circuit remains unchanged. This ensures that the measurement is accurate and does not affect the circuit.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) It does not load the circuit",

By using only one of these gates and a large number of other gates connected to it, you can create a logic gate to perform any desired logical function.\n\nThe XOR gate is also universal because it can be used to create a logic gate to perform any desired logical function using the other three basic gates.\n\nConclusion: The sets of gate pairs (A) and (D) contain NOR and NAND gates, making them universal gate pairs.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: We need to find the maximum voltage that the circuit can achieve. To do this, we first find the maximum value of the source voltage:\n\n400 sin(314 t) = 400 sin(314 / 2) = 400 sin(157) = 400 sin(2 pi radians / 6)\n\nThe maximum value of sin(157) is 200, so the maximum value of the source voltage is 400 sin(157) = 400 * 200 = 8000 V.\n\nStep 2: We need to find the maximum value of the load counter emf. We can do this by finding the maximum value of:\n\n8000 sin(314 / 2) = 8000 sin(314 / 2) = 8000 sin(157)\n\nThe maximum value of sin(157) is 400, so the maximum value of the load counter emf is 8000 sin(157) = 8000 * 400 = 32000 V.\n\nStep 3: We need to find the firing angle. We know that the source voltage is equal to the load counter emf when the firing angle is 120\u00b0. Therefore:\n\n400 sin(314 / 2) = 32000\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the firing angle:\n\nsin(314 / 2) = 8000 / 400\n\nTherefore, the firing angle is:\n\nsin(314 / 2) = 20\n\nStep 4: To find the range of firing angles, we can take the difference between the maximum and minimum firing angles. The maximum firing angle is 150\u00b0 and the minimum firing angle is 0\u00b0, so the range is:\n\n150\u00b0 - 0\u00b0 = 150\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the range of firing angle control is (A) 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0.",
