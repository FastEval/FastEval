This can be done by adding the numbers of each color that were given: two mauve cat toys, three grey cat toys, three burgundy cat toys. There are a total of four distinct colors of cat toys, since purple is only used once.\n\nNow we can use Bachet's \\binom{4}{1}\\cdot3+2\\cdot4+3\\cdot1=14 to count the total number of cat toys, and subtract this from the total number of objects on the floor, which includes the notebooks. This gives us 14 - 10 = 4 objects. Since all of the remaining objects are grey, there are four grey cat toys left on the floor after all of the notebooks are removed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) three.",

The green dog leash is on the left side of the pen.\n2. The orange cat toy is next to the green dog leash. Therefore, the next item should be on the right side of the pen.\n3. The mauve keychain is next to the orange cat toy. Therefore, the next item should be on the left side of the pen.\n4. The silver pen is in the middle of the arrangement.\n5. The black crayon is on the right side of the pen.\n\nNow, we need to find the position of each item relative to the pen. The pen is in the middle, and the keychain and crayon are on the left and right sides, respectively.\n\nAssuming the arrangement is arranged in the order that we found the positions: green dog leash, orange cat toy, mauve keychain, silver pen, black crayon, we can determine the color of the item furthest from the pen.\n\nThe color of the item furthest from the pen is (H) fuchsia.\n\n(H) fuchsia",

The yellow keychain is first, followed by the silver envelope, then the black booklet, and finally, the teal plate.\n2. Since the objects are arranged in a straight line in ascending order from left to right, they must be of different colors.\n3. The yellow keychain is on the left, which means the next object in the row must be on the right of the keychain.\n4. The next object is the silver envelope, which is silver in color.
