On the other hand, option (B) is sarcastic, as it uses contrasting words (\"didn't threaten, he only pleaded\") to exaggerate the difference between the two actions.

Therefore, option A is sarcastic in that it makes a ridiculous suggestion.\n\nOption B is not sarcastic because it suggests a reasonable alternative to trams.

In order to determine if a statement is sarcastic, four key elements must be present: (1) the speaker must intend to convey the opposite of what is said, (2) the listener must recognize the intent, (3) the statement must exceed the speaker's expectations, and (4) the listener must recognize that the statement goes beyond the speaker's expectations.\n\nHere, option (A) does not have any element of the sarcasm as it is an assertion that is expected because of height. On the other hand, option (B) is sarcastic as the speaker is saying that someone who is over six feet tall is not necessarily tall but it seems sarcastic because it is opposite of what you would expect. The speaker is suggesting that someone who is over six feet tall is not expected to be tall, and this exceeds the listener's expectations and makes it sarcastic.\n\nAnswer: (B) He's over six feet, so he must be wonderful.",

Fast food restaurants typically utilize standardized recipes and assembly-line processes, which require minimal skill and training to perform. Therefore, it is more likely that the person has simply learned to work efficiently in a fast food environment, perhaps with some applicable training or experience in food service.\n\nThus, the statement is sarcastic because it is making a joke about the ease of becoming a \"great\" chef through working at McDonald's, rather than acknowledging any actual skill or experience the person may have gained.",
