To determine which penguin is the oldest, we need to compare their ages. The oldest penguin must have been born before all the others.\n\nThe oldest giraffe is not known since we do not have information about when they were born.\n\nThe age of the oldest penguin is either 7 or 5. The age of Louis and Bernard is given in the table. Since we don't know the age of Gwen and James, we cannot make a conclusion about them.\n\nFrom the table, it is clear that the name Louis and the age 7 appear in a row, which means that Louis is older than Vincent, who is 9 years old. Therefore, Louis is the oldest penguin.\n\nIn summary, the reason for choosing option (A) is that we can compare the ages of the penguins in the table, Louis's age is 7, and Vincent is 9, which means Louis is the oldest penguin.",
