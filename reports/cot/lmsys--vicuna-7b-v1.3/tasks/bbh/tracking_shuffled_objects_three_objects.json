Thus, at the end of the dance, Bob is dancing with either Ophelia or Jamie, while Claire is dancing with the remaining partner (Rodrigo or the second dancer who Bob and Claire switched with).\n\nWe can analyze this situation by examining the possible pairings and Bob's initial dance partner.\n\nScenario 1: Claire is dancing with Rodrigo at the end of the dance. In this case, Bob's initial dance partner Ophelia ends up with Jamie, who switches partners with Bob. Therefore, Bob is dancing with either Ophelia or Jamie.\n\nScenario 2: Claire is dancing with the second dancer who Bob and Claire switched with. Let's call this dancer D. At this point, the partners are:\nAlice (D)\nBob (Ophelia/Jamie)\nClaire (Rodrigo/D)\n\nIn this case, when Alice and Bob switch partners, Bob ends up with Ophelia (initial dance partner), and Alice ends up with the second dancer who Bob and Claire switched with (D). Thus, Bob is dancing with either Ophelia or Jamie, and the answer is:\n\n(B) Jamie",

At the start of the semester, Alice, Bob, and Claire each buy one new book:\n* Alice buys \"Frankenstein\"\n* Bob buys \"Moby Dick\"\n* Claire buys \"The Fellowship of the Ring\"\n1. They trade books:\n* Alice and Bob swap books: This means that theoretically, after trading, Bob should have Alice's \"Frankenstein\" and Alice should have Bob's \"Moby Dick\".\n* Claire and Alice swap books: This means that theoretically, after trading, Alice should have Claire's \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" and Claire should have Alice's \"Frankenstein\".\n* Bob and Claire swap books: This means that theoretically, after trading, Bob should have Claire's \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" and Claire should have Bob's \"Moby Dick\".\n\nNow we have a situation where each person has a new book and one of the original books.\n\n1. At the end of the semester, Bob has a new book:\n* Frankenstein, which Alice originally bought and gave to him in the first trade.\n1. Based on the above information, the answer is (C) \"The Fellowship of the Ring\".\n\nAlice was initially given \"Frankenstein\" and Bob was initially given \"Moby Dick\".

Finally, Bob and Claire exchanged \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" and \"Moby Dick\" respectively, so at the end of the semester, Bob holds \"Moby Dick\" which was given to him by Alice in the first trade.\n\nTherefore, Bob has \"Moby Dick\", which corresponds to option (B). Alice has acquired \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" during trading, so she should have \"The Hobbit\" while Bob should have \"The Fellowship of the Ring\". Hence, the answer is (B) \"Moby Dick\".",
