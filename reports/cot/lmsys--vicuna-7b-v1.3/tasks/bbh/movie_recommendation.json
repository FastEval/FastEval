            "model_answer": "Sure, here's my reasoning:\n\nOption (A), The Front Page, is a classic comedy about a group of journalists and the stories they cover. It does not have the dark and brooding tone of Batman and is not a superhero story or action-adventure like The Mask or The Fugitive. Option (B), Maelstrom, is a French film about a young boy's experiences during World War II, which could be considered more of a historical drama or war film rather than a movie similar to the others. Option (C), The Lion King, is a classic Disney animated film, but it is not a live-action film like Pretty Woman or one that has a similar tone or genre.\n\nTherefore, the only option that could be considered similar to the given options (Batman, The Mask, The Fugitive, Pretty Woman) would be Option (D), Lamerica, which is a movie about immigration, personal struggles, and a search for identity. While it is not a direct match to any of the given options, it has similar themes and could be considered a similar movie.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nD",
