Additionally, it places \"leather\" after \"American,\" which is also incorrect because it violates the standard order of adjectives.\n\nOption (B), on the other hand, places \"new\" and \"triangular\" in the correct order, followed by \"big\" and \"leather\" in the correct order.

The sentence (A) has the correct adjective order, as it has \"enormous\" modifier preceding \"brand-new\" modifying \"motorcycle\". On the other hand, sentence (B) has the adjective \"brand-new\" preceding \"enormous\" modifying \"German\", which is incorrect as it should be \"brand-new\" modifying \"motorcycle\" and \"enormous\" modifying \"German\".
