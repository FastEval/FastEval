            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The Robertsonian translocation is a type of genetic disorder that results from the rearrangement of chromosomes. In this situation, two non-homologous chromosomes exchange part of their DNA, resulting in the formation of a new derivative chromosome. The fusion of the two chromosomes occurs at specific regions called the breakpoint. The breakpoint is the point where the two chromosomes break and exchange DNA.\n\nThere are four possible breakpoints that can occur in Robertsonian translocations: telomeres, centromeres, histones, and ends of the long arms. Telomeres and centromeres are both regions that are involved in the maintenance of the structure of the chromosome. Histones play a role in the packaging of DNA into chromosomes. The ends of the long arms of the chromosomes are where the DNA fibers that make up the chromosomes are held together, and this region is called the kinetochore.\n\nBased on the definition of the Robertsonian translocation and the different regions of the chromosome at which the fusion can occur, it can be concluded that the fusion of the two chromosomes occurs at the breakpoint, which is likely to be located at the telomeres, centromeres, or histones. However, since the breakpoint is the region of rearrangement, it is possible that fusion can occur at the ends of the long arm of the chromosome.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) centromeres.",

            "model_answer": "Zinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are (A) types of DNA-binding proteins.\n\nExplanation:\n\nZinc finger proteins and helix-turn-helix proteins are two families of proteins that are known to bind to specific DNA sequences. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by their ability to bind to DNA through a zinc ion, which is bound to a set of conserved cysteine residues in the protein. Helix-turn-helix proteins, also called homeodomain proteins, have a similar structure to zinc finger proteins but typically bind to DNA through a different set of conserved residues. Both families of proteins are involved in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences and either activating or repressing the expression of nearby genes. Therefore, they are considered to be types of DNA-binding proteins.\n\nAnswer: A",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the expected frequency of affected females, we need to understand the inheritance pattern of the X-linked recessive condition. In this case, males are affected when they inherit a mutated X chromosome from their mother and a normal X chromosome from their father, while females are affected when they inherit two copies of the mutated X chromosome, one from each parent.\n\nStep 1: Identify the affected group: A male is affected if he inherits a mutated X chromosome.\n\nStep 2: Determine the group of unaffected individuals: A female is unaffected if she inherits two normal X chromosomes (one from each parent).\n\nGiven the frequency of males affected, we can calculate the expected frequency of affected females:\n\nStep 3: Count the number of males affected: 0.10 \\* total number of males = expected number of affected males\n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of unaffected females: total number of females - expected number of affected males = 0.90 \\* total number of females = expected number of unaffected females\n\nSince the question asks for the expected frequency of affected females, we can find this ratio:\n\n(expected number of affected females / total number of females) = 0.10 / 1\n\nStep 5: Simplify the ratio: expected frequency of affected females / total number of females = 0.10\n\nTherefore, the expected frequency of affected females in this human population is (A) 0.01.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) can be determined by examining the mode of inheritance and the appearance of the trait in different family members.\n\n(A) Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern: In autosomal dominant inheritance, a single copy of the dominant gene is sufficient to cause the trait or disease. A carrier of the dominant gene has a 50% chance of passing it on to their offspring. In malignant hyperthermia, the condition is caused by a dominant mutation in the gene encoding the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor. The condition can occur in individuals who inherit a single copy of the mutated gene from one affected parent.\n\n(B) Autosomal recessive inheritance pattern: In autosomal recessive inheritance, an individual must inherit two copies of the recessive gene, one from each affected parent, to develop the trait or disease. If an individual only inherits one copy of the recessive gene, they are a carrier but usually do not show symptoms. Carriers of autosomal recessive traits can pass the gene on to their offspring with one-fourth chance (25%). In malignant hyperthermia, autosomal recessive inheritance is unlikely, since the condition is caused by a dominant mutation in the ryanodine receptor gene.\n\n(C) X-linked dominant inheritance pattern: In X-linked dominant inheritance, males are more commonly affected than females because they inherit the X chromosome from their mother, who is typically a carrier of the dominant gene. An affected female has one normal X chromosome and one X with the dominant mutation, while an affected male has an X with the dominant mutation. In malignant hyperthermia, the X-linked dominant inheritance pattern is less likely because the condition is caused by a dominant mutation in the gene encoding the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, which is located on chromosome 19. It is more likely that malignant hyperthermia follows a (D) X-linked recessive inheritance pattern.\n\n(D) X-linked recessive inheritance pattern: In X-linked recessive inheritance, males are much more severely affected than females, because they inherit the X chromosome with the recessive mutation from their mother, who is typically a carrier. Effective X-linked recessive inheritance requires that the mutation be inactive (i.e., not expressed) in the father because, in the heterozygous state, the mutation is not transmitted to the offspring. Since X-linked recessive inheritance typically results in a milder expression of the trait in males than in females, an individual who is heterozygous for the X-linked recessive trait may have a milder form of the condition. In malignant hyperthermia, X-linked recessive inheritance cannot be excluded because the condition is caused by a dominant mutation in the ryanodine receptor gene, which is on chromosome X, and could potentially be masked by overexpression of the normal gene in the heterozygous state.\n\nAnswer: (D) X-linked recessive.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider how various forms of adversity or stress exposures can impact the health and well-being of parents, which can then affect the health and development of their offspring.\n\nA) War refers primarily to armed conflicts that can lead to injury, death, trauma, displacement, and exposure to violence and related stressors, which can impact both the parents and the offspring. Children living in war-affected areas may experience a range of health problems, including mental health disorders, malnutrition, and increased risk of infectious diseases (B).\n\nB) Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, etc., can cause physical injury, displacement, loss of infrastructure, and disruptions in access to basic needs, leading to vulnerability and stress for both parents and offspring. For example, parents may experience trauma-related stress and mental health issues, while children may experience developmental delays or anxiety (C).\n\nC) Hunger can affect both parents and offspring by causing malnutrition, weakened immune system, stunted growth, and developmental delays, depending on the severity and duration of the food insecurity (C).\n\nD) All of the above - war, natural disasters, and hunger - can all cause serious stress, health problems, and disruptions in parental and offspring health and development.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria, it is necessary to understand the basics of phenylketonuria and how genetics works. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which leads to a build-up of phenylalanine and other compounds in the body. PKU is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that an individual must have two copies of the defective gene (one from each parent) to develop the disorder.\n\nThe risk of a child inheriting PKU from each parent depends on the specific alleles (forms) of the gene that the parents carry. In a population, the frequencies of different alleles at a particular gene locus can vary. For example, if one allele has a frequency of 0.6 in the population and the other allele has a frequency of 0.4, then the frequency of homozygosity (carrying two copies of the same allele) is 0.2.\n\nTo calculate the risk of a child inheriting PKU from each parent, you need to know the frequency of the defective allele. However, that information is not provided in the question. Therefore, it is not possible to give an exact answer to this question without that information.\n\nIf the frequencies of the alleles are known, one can use the following equations to calculate the risks:\n\nRisk of inheriting PKU from mother: Risk of inheriting PKU from father:\n\nThe final answer would still be a letter in parenthesis, but without any additional information.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Let's analyze the four options and the context of exon skipping to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n(A) Nonsense mutations: Exon skipping is an RNA processing mechanism; therefore, it is not directly related to nonsense mutations. However, exon skipping can sometimes correct gene expression in cases of nonsense mutations (frameshift), allowing the production of a truncated, yet functional protein.\n\n(B) Regulatory mutations: Exon skipping can also be caused by mutations in the miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA), leading to the underproduction or absence of a specific miRNA. This can, in turn, result in faulty regulation of target gene expression.\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations: Exon skipping can be attributed to mutations in pre-miRNA or other elements of RNA processing, such as splicing, leading to the alteration or lack of a specific miRNA molecule and, thus, the regulation of its target mRNA.\n\n(D) Silent mutations: Silent mutations do not affect the primary structure of the protein, but exon skipping is not necessarily a silent mutation. It involves the alteration of the miRNA, which could affect the regulation of its target gene.\n\nBased on the context, exon skipping is more closely related to RNA processing mutations (C) and regulatory mutations (B).
