            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The style of fuzzing that is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the given program is (C) Whitebox fuzzing. Whitebox fuzzing involves instrumenting the target code to execute specific operations or functions with varying inputs, coverage-guided fuzzing, and state-of-the-art mutation vector generation. Whitebox fuzzing has better coverage as it has full knowledge of the target's code, method names, and can control the logic flow of the program.\n\n(A) Generational fuzzing involves creating a population of virtual machines and only exposes the original program to them. This is less likely to achieve full coverage of the lines of code as not all executing paths may be tested.\n\n(B) Blackbox fuzzing tests the program using arbitrary parameters and does not have knowledge of what inputs to feed them to achieve full coverage.\n\n(D) Mutation-based fuzzing works by applying random mutations to the user's data to create a unique input stream. This technique is effective in identifying boundary cases, but may not be able to achieve full coverage of the lines of code if the mutations are not varied enough.",

            "question": "Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server.

            "model_answer": "To determine which attacks TLS protects against, we need to analyze the different steps in the TLS protocol and understand how each option on the given choices might lead to an attack.\n\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.\n\nIn this scenario, the attacker captures the message(s) exchanged between the client and the server and replays them later to potentially perform a replay attack. TLS protects against this type of attack by using a handshake to establish a unique Session ID for each session. The server is responsible for not reusing Session IDs to protect against replay attacks. Both the client and the server verify the nonce value to detect if a replay attack is in process.\n\n1. An attacker impersonating the server.\n\nTLS uses digital certificates to verify the identity of the server. The client performs a certificate verification process during the TLS handshake. If the server's certificate is not valid or doesn't match the domain name, the client disconnects and notifies the user. Even if an attacker captures and modifies the server's certificate, they cannot impersonate the server during a TLS handshake.\n\nIf no client certificate is provided, and the server's certificate uploads successfully and the client and server don't leak their keys, there is no way for an attacker to use impersonation as an attack vector. Therefore, (C) is the correct answer.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n(C) True, False",

            "model_answer": "(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket's expiration time to the server's current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe Kerberos KDC server has a maximum ticket lifetime of 24 hours for most user principals. This means that if a client's Kerberos ticket expires, it cannot be used to authenticate the user with the KDC and the client will receive a \"Ticket Expired\" error.\n\nTo ensure that an expired Kerberos ticket cannot be used, the server compares the ticket's expiration time to the server's current clock. If the ticket has expired, the server refuses to authenticate the user and terminates the connection. This means that clients using expired tickets will no longer be able to access resources secured by the Kerberos KDC.\n\nThe other options are not accurate:\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets. While the KDC can refuse to establish new connections for expired tickets, it does not ensure that an existing connection is terminated.\n\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime. This is not accurate, as the server does not use a timer to determine if a ticket has expired.\n\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired. This is not accurate, as the server does not query the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid. Instead, the server compares the ticket's expiration time to its own clock to determine if the ticket has expired.",

Therefore, the sender of the message must ensure that it is coded or encrypted in a way that only the intended recipient(s) can decipher it.\n\nTo achieve confidentiality, the sender can take measures such as using a secure communication channel, encrypting the message, or encoding it in a way that only the intended recipient(s) can understand. This ensures that even if the message is intercepted by an unauthorized party, they would not be able to understand it.\n\nIn contrast, the receiver of the message is responsible for decoding or decrypting the message. The modulator is responsible for converting the message from text to a signal that can be sent over the communication channel. The translator, on the other hand, is responsible for translating the message from one language to another if necessary.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Sender.",

This can be a result of a lack of string boundary checks in predefined functions, as these checks prevent a buffer from overflowing into adjacent memory locations.\n\n(B) No storage check in the external memory:\nWhen a program writes data to external memory (such as a hard drive or network), it is the responsibility of the operating system to ensure that the data is written to a safe location. Without proper storage checks, the data could be written to locations where it is not allowed, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n(C) No processing power check:\nBuffer overflows can also be caused by insufficient checking of the processing power of a program. For example, if a program has a buffer that is too small to hold the data it is processing, a buffer overflow could occur.\n\n(D) No database check:\nFinally, buffer overflows can occur even in programs that check for incomplete data and they can occur even in programs that are checking for incomplete data with buffer overflow and even in programs that are checking for incomplete data with size check.\n\nSo the answer is (A) No string boundary checks in predefined functions.",
