            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\nStatement 1| Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\n\nWe need to understand the definition of variance and unbiasedness before jumping into the solution.\n\nVariance measures the spread or dispersion of a set of numbers. An unbiased estimator is one that is expected to converge towards the true value of the parameter being estimated.\n\nNow, we need to determine which estimator would have the smallest variance. To do this, we consider a standard sample from a large population with unknown means for both estimators.\n\nFor a linear regression estimator, we assume a normal distribution for the sample mean. The variance of this normal distribution is \u03c3^2, while the standard deviation is \u03c3. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, therefore:\n\nVar(linear regression estimator) = Var(X^2) = \u03c3^2 = \u03c3^2 / sqrt(n) = O(\u03c3 / n)\n\nFor the estimator formed by the classifier in AdaBoost, we need to consider whether it is an unbiased estimator. The AdaBoost estimator is a weighted sum of the individual classifier errors from the weak learners. Assume each classifier error is normally distributed, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\nNow, form the weighted average of the classifier errors: w\\_i x\\_i. The variance of the weighted average corresponds to the variance of the errors. Divide the variance by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nFor AdaBoost, Var(weighted average) = Var(\u2211wi xi) = O(w\\_i^2 \\* Var(xi)) = O(w\\_i^2 \\* 1 / sqrt(n))\n\nBoth estimators converge towards 0, so we'll focus on their variances. The variance of the linear regression estimator is O(\u03c3 / n) for n large, while the variance of the AdaBoost estimator is O(w\\_i^2 \\* 1 / sqrt(n)) for n large.\n\nWe can see that the variance of the linear regression estimator grows slower in comparison to AdaBoost's as n increases. Thus, according to the definition of a minimax estimator, which is the one with the smallest variance, the linear regression estimator is the choice.\n\nTherefore, we have collected enough evidence to choose: (A) True, True.\n\nStatement 2| The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\n\nTo prove that the coefficients are always non-negative, we need to explore how AdaBoost estimate the weights of its weak classifiers. The weights, w\\_i, are updated iteratively using a stochastic learning algorithm, usually on one-half of the data.\n\nThe algorithm has the following steps:\n\n1. For each training example, the weights are adjusted according to the loss function, which is typically mean squared error (MSE).\n2. After all training examples have been processed, the new weights are assigned to the next training examples.\n\nDuring training, the weights will have values between -infinity and \u221e, but they are scaled before being used for prediction by taking the absolute value.\n\nWe can see that when the algorithm converges, the weighted error of a weak learner will always be non-negative, which means the terms in its coefficient will also be non-negative. By induction, for the entire training process, the updated coefficients of the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost will also be non-negative.",

            "model_answer": "To determine whether either or both of the statements are true, we need to analyze each statement individually and then compare them.\n\nStatement 1: RoBERTa pretrains on a corpus that is approximately 10x larger than the corpus BERT pretrained on.\nFirst, we need to calculate the size of the corpus BERT pretrained on. BERT-base was pretrained on the Universal Dependencies (UD) v2.4 treebank containing 250 megabytes of text. Let's assume it's the same for BERT.\nNext, we should find the size of the corpus RoBERTa pretrained on. RoBERTa-large has a quote vocabulary size of 195 million (out of 575 million possible tokens), which means around 50-55% is unique. Assuming it's 50%, the total size would be roughly 256 million tokens. With an average length of 4 tokens per word, this would be around 1,024,000,000 tokens or 256 MB.\nSo, the size difference is not exactly 10x, but closer to a factor of 2.25 (256 MB / 125 MB).\n\nStatement 2: ResNeXts in 2018 usually used tanh activation functions.\nTo analyze this statement, we need to know which specific ResNeXt model was used in 2018. However, assuming the ResNeXt-101 model with its five variants (t, d, s, e, and x) was the most widely used in 2018, let's consider its architecture.\nThe ResNeXt-101 uses the standard 101-layer ResNet architecture with directional and Global Average Pooling (GAP) module additionally. The input is followed by a square neck with one or two linear layers, then the ResNet layers. The ResNet layers themselves are essentially Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) and ReLU activation layers with some residual connections. After the ResNet part (with batch normalization layers still included), there are two transition layers to move between different beam widths. The final layers are then used to predict the embedding size.\nGiven that the ResNeXt models use ReLU activations, as opposed to sigmoid or tanh activations, the statement \"usually\" implies a significant deviation from the norm, which is not the case. As a result, option (D) is not true.\n\nIn conclusion, the final answer is (A) True, True, as both statements are true.",

In SVMs, the goal is to find the hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes, and the hyperplane is determined by a set of support vectors. These are the data points closest to the hyperplane that define the boundary between the two classes. Therefore, SVM gives a probability distribution over the possible labels given an input example, with each output value corresponding to one of the support vectors.\n\nThe second statement (B) is also true. In general, the support vectors should remain the same when changing from a linear kernel to a higher-order polynomial kernel. This is because the choice of kernel is based on the underlying assumption that the data is convex in the context of SVM. Convex data can be separated by a hyperplane, and a higher-order polynomial kernel can accurately approximate a convex data set. The only exception is when the data is not convex in one direction, in which case using a polynomial kernel with the highest degree in that direction can help improve the margin. Thus, when changing from a linear kernel to a polynomial kernel, the support vectors should remain mostly the same since both kernels assume a convex data set.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer(s) are (A) True, True and (B) True, True.",
