            "model_answer": "To answer the question based on the given information, we need to understand the implications of Gibbon's statement and the historical context of ancient Rome.\n\nFirst, it is important to note that the Roman world had a diverse population, with various ethnic groups, languages, and cultures. It is likely that this diversity contributed to the existence of multiple modes of worship.\n\nSecondly, Gibbon's statement indicates that these different modes of worship were considered equal by the general public, false by philosophers, and useful by the authorities. This suggests that the various modes of worship were not considered to be the same or simply interchangeable, but rather different and with different levels of legitimacy according to different perspectives.\n\nThirdly, it is important to realize that the Roman Empire was predominantly pagan, and religious worship was closely tied to the state and society. The state played a substantial role in the regulation of religious practices and their funding, and religious rituals were often part of the ceremonies and celebrations of the civic religion.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that religious worship in ancient Rome did not fit into a single category as described in options (A)-(D). Instead, it appears to have been diverse and not equally true, false, or useful from the viewpoints of the general public, philosophers, and the authorities respectively. Therefore, option (C) is the closest answer, as it describes a highly centralized form of worship.\n\nThe answer is (C).",

One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life!

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "In order to determine which characteristic of Enlightenment intellectuals best illustrates the ideas expressed by Voltaire in the given quote, we need to analyze the main themes present in his statements. The quote primarily revolves around critiques of religion, natural disasters, and the injustice of the world. It also contains a touch of cynicism and a call for tolerance.\n\nAnalyzing the quote, we can recognize two main themes: criticism of religion and a reminder of the fragility of human life. The idea that the Inquisition palace might have been destroyed along with other buildings during the earthquake implies a rejection of religious persecution. The rest of the text reflects on the unfairness of life and the cruelty of nature, which may align with the Enlightenment value of rationality. The idea that people should not be persecuted \"while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallowing up one and all\" suggests a more objective and tolerant approach to social and cultural issues.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most relevant characteristic of Enlightenment intellectuals for the ideas expressed by Voltaire is (D) Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues. The quote does not emphasize scientific discoveries, nor does it focus on the failures of religion to explain natural phenomena. Instead, the focus is on the unfairness of life and the injustices committed by religious institutions. Therefore, option (D) seems to best illustrate the ideas expressed by Voltaire.\n\n(D) Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.",

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.",

We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.
