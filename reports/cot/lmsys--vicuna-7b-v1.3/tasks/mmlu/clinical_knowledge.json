            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the appropriate size of cannula to use in a patient who needed a rapid blood transfusion, we need to consider a few factors, such as blood flow rate and patient anatomy. Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Estimate blood flow rate: Rapid blood transfusions are typically given during high-risk situations, such as major surgery or trauma. In these situations, blood flow rates can be quite high, possibly in the range of 500-1000 mL per minute.\n2. Select an appropriate cannula size: To deliver blood at this rate, a large-bore cannula is required. The larger the bore, the lower the resistance to flow, which can help maintain blood pressure and minimize blood loss.\n3. Consider patient anatomy: The size and location of the cannula will depend on the patient's anatomy. Typically, large-bore cannulas are used in the femoral vein, as this provides direct access to the heart and bypasses the need for compulsory drip rates in the arterial system.\n\nBased on these factors, a 16 or 18 gauge cannula would be appropriate for a patient who needed a rapid blood transfusion in 2020. The 16 gauge cannula is larger than the 18 gauge and has a smaller diameter (0.18 x 1.5 inches vs. 0.20 x 1.5 inches).\n\n(C) 22 gauge is too small for rapid blood transfusions and should be avoided.\n(D) 24 gauge is too large and should also be avoided.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the key attribute in successful marathon running, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n(A) strength: Strength is important for running, but it is not the primary factor in successful marathon running. Marathon runners need to have a good combination of endurance, power, and stamina to finish the race.\n\n(B) power: Power is important in many sports, including running, but it is not the primary factor in successful marathon running. While a strong runner can generate more power with each stride, this alone is not enough to ensure success in a marathon.\n\n(C) stride length: Stride length can vary among runners, but it is not the most important attribute in successful marathon running. While a longer stride can help a runner cover more ground per step, it is not the sole determinant of success in a marathon.\n\n(D) stamina: Stamina is critical to successful marathon running. Runners need to be able to sustain a high level of physical performance for an extended period, usually several hours, to finish the race. Stamina is the key attribute that distinguishes successful marathon runners from those who do not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) stamina.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the situation in which closed pouches are applied, we need to consider the definition and different types of stoma. A stoma refers to the surgical creation of a small opening in the abdomen through which waste products pass. There are two types of stomas: colostomy (carrying waste products from the large intestine), urostomy (carrying urine from the urinary bladder), and ureterostomy (carrying urine via a urinary catheter from the kidney directly into the scrotum in cases of ureteronephrosis).\n\nExplanation:\n\nClosed pouches are commonly applied for a colostomy (A) and ureterostomy (D).\nTo find the correct option, we need to consider in what situation these openings are created.\nA colostomy is created when a part of the large intestine is removed due to cancer, inflammation, or injury. In this case, waste products bypass the damaged part of the intestine and are collected in a bag.\nA ureterostomy is created in cases of blockage of the urinary system due to tumors, cysts, urinary stones, or infections. It allows urine to pass directly into a bag, bypassing the urinary bladder and the urethra.\n\nTherefore, closed pouches are applied:\n(A) The patient has a semi-formed or liquid output (colostomy)\n(D) The patient has a ureterostomy",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "When a person participates in multiple sprints, their anaerobic capacity improves with each subsequent sprint. This is because the body adapts to the increased demand for oxygen by making its energy-producing processes more efficient in anaerobic conditions. As the sprints become more frequent, the body's ability to generate energy without oxygen (anaerobically) becomes more efficient. This increased efficiency results in a larger proportion of energy being derived from anaerobic metabolism during the sprints, leading to the progression mentioned in option (A).\n\nIt is important to note that as the number of sprints increases, the duration of each sprint will decrease, making the total exercise time more exhaustive. Additionally, even though the blood glucose concentration might remain above 3 mmol/L if a person has squirted water on their forearms at the start, it's unlikely that it falls below 3 mmol/L during the exercise without water manipulation. Therefore, options (B) and (D) seem less likely, though both would provide plausible reasons to select either (A) or (C).",

If diplopia occurs, the outer image is always the false image because it is formed by the contralateral (opposite) eye.\n\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards: This statement is false. A fourth nerve palsy typically occurs when the patient looks downwards, causing double vision in the vertical gaze field.\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint: This statement is true.

            "model_answer": "(A)\n\nSodium bicarbonate ingestion is commonly used in sports to improve performance, and it is believed to work by buffering the acidity in the blood and thus reducing the need for oxygen. This allows for a greater volume of blood to be sent to the working muscles, which in turn can provide more energy. Sodium bicarbonate is often used in endurance sports to improve performance.\n\nWhen a person exercises, lactic acid is produced in the muscles as a byproduct of anaerobic respiration. This lactic acid build-up leads to an increase in acidity in the blood, which can lead to fatigue and a decreased ability to process oxygen. Sodium bicarbonate, by neutralizing the acidity in the blood, can help reduce this build-up of lactic acid and thus improve exercise performance. Additionally, sodium bicarbonate can help increase the amount of oxygen that reaches the muscles, which can also improve performance.\n\nAll options are possible ways that sodium bicarbonate can improve performance.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\nFatty acids are transported from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria primarily by carnitine. Carnitine function is crucial in this step because it converts long-chain fatty acids into components that can pass through the mitochondrial membrane. After this conversion, the fatty acids are bound to another coenzyme, acetyl-CoA, which is required for the subsequent metabolic pathways in the cytoplasm.\n\nThe conversion of long-chain fatty acids into acetyl-CoA involves the participation of multiple enzymes, such as acyl-CoA synthetase and other cofactors. The final product of this process is a molecule that can enter the mitochondria.\n\nAfter the fatty acids are inside the mitochondria, they can be metabolized in different pathways. Some are converted to acetyl-CoA, which then proceeds through the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Other fatty acids are converted into molecules called acyl-carnitines, which are transported to the mitochondria's matrix before being utilized in different metabolic pathways.\n\nGiven the sequence of events, the step-by-step reasoning suggests that (D) carnitine is the correct answer. However, it's important to note that there is a broader context to consider because the pathway might involve other components, such as enzymes and cofactors not explicitly mentioned here.
