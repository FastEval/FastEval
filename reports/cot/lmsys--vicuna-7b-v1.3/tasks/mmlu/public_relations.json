            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the year in which the BBC started broadcasting radio, we need to consider the history of the British Broadcasting Corporation. The BBC was founded on January 1, 1927, as a result of the creation of the BBC Act passed by Parliament in June 1926. This act established the BBC as a public corporation and gave it a remit to provide broadcasting services in the United Kingdom.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the BBC, there were a number of private radio broadcasters in the UK, including the Marconi-Eccles Experimental Station, which began operating in 1920. However, these stations were not publicly funded and operated mainly for experimental purposes.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the answer is (D) 1927, the year in which the BBC was founded.",

This type of campaign is often used to build trust and authenticity among potential customers.\n\n(C) Idea-oriented: In this type of campaign, the advertisement focuses on an idea or concept related to the product or brand.

            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) to consider the role public relations might play. Here is the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Public relations counselors are responsible for advising organizations on how to manage their public image and reputation.\n2. This requires an understanding of the organization's current and potential future realities, as well as how public opinion and trends may impact its reputation.\n3. By continually reviewing present and future realities for an organization, the public relations counselor can identify potential challenges and opportunities that may require a change in strategy or approach.\n4. This can help the organization to maintain a positive image and reputation among its stakeholders, including customers, employees, investors, and the general public.\n5. Therefore, the goal of the public relations counselor is to consider the role that public relations might play in the organization's overall success, which includes taking into account the present and future realities that may impact its reputation.\n\nThe answer is (D) to consider the role public relations might play, which is a single letter with parenthesis without anything else.",

            "model_answer": "(C) When people hide their opinions if they are in disagreement with their close peers or family members\n\nExplanation:\nThe spiral of silence theory, proposed by Communication Scholar Noelle-Lin\u0446\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e Claire Windbichel, explains how people may self-censor their opinions in groups that are perceived to have a disinterest or opposition in their topic. This self-censorship, or silence, can lead to misunderstandings in public discourse.\n\nIn the spiral of silence, the silence is predominantly caused by people being uncertain or fearful about speaking out in a minority position when they feel the group's opinion isn't just ignored, but actively opposed. (A) and (D) represent specific circumstances of the spiral of silence.\n\n(B) can be influenced by the spiral of silence, but it's not the cause of it. Majority opinion only influences the silence if that majority opposes the minority opinion.\n\n(C) best describes the spiral of silence, as the silence arises when people in minority positions censor themselves out of fear or self-censorship in the face of strong opposition.",

            "model_answer": "Before providing the answer, I'll explain my reasoning step-by-step.\n\nThe four categories of persuasive crisis communication strategies identified by W. Timothy Coombs are ingratiation, downplaying, distancing, and denial.\n\nLet's analyze each option provided to determine which one does not belong:\n\n(A) Ingratiation: Ingratiation is a strategy in which an organization attempts to gain the trust and goodwill of stakeholders by being empathetic, sincere, and cooperative during a crisis.\n\n(B) Downplaying: Downplaying involves minimizing the severity of a crisis by playing down its potential impact or significance. This can involve denying certain aspects of the crisis or emphasizing positive factors.\n\n(C) Distancing: Distancing is a strategy in which an organization distances itself from the crisis to maintain a sense of control and avoid being seen as responsible or liable. This can involve providing a clear separation between the organization and the crisis or emphasizing certain factors to illustrate the organization's innocence or victimhood.\n\n(D) Nonexistence: Nonexistence, at first glance, seems easy to rule out as a strategy. However, in certain situations, an organization may not have the ability to warrant a specific crisis communication strategy, such as when there is no crisis or when the crisis is external to the organization.\n\n---\n\nThe correct answer is (D) Nonexistence.",
