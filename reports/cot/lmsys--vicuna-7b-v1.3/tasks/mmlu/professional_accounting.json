            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the formula to calculate the estimated yearly yield on the investment. The formula is:\n\nEstimated Yearly Yield = (Total Monthly Income - Monthly Expenses) / (Monthly Expenses / 12)\n\nIn this case, the total monthly income is $245 per hour \\* 2 hours = $490, and the monthly expenses are $50. Therefore, the estimated yearly yield will be calculated as follows:\n\n(490 - 50) / (50 / 12) = 16.25%\n\nTo find the correct answer, we need to round up the answer. The closest whole number answer to 16.25% with rounding down is 16.2%. Therefore, the answer is (C) 0.45%.",

SFAS is a type of authoritative guidance that the FASB issues to provide specific principles or requirements for financial accounting and reporting.

            "model_answer": "To determine the effect of the error on the carrying amount and retained earnings amount of the bond at June 30 year 12, we need to first understand the difference between the straight-line method and the effective interest method.\n\nThe straight-line method of amortizing premium bonds is based on the bond's remaining maturity, with equal annual charges to interest and premium. The effective interest method takes into account the time value of money and projects the future income from the bond as a single lump sum.\n\nWe can compare the two methods by considering the effective interest method as the true interest rate of the bond and the straight-line method as an approximation. The difference between the two rates represents the opportunity cost of the bond, which is the return that the bond could have earned if it were not held.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to each choice:\n\n(A) Overstated: The straight-line method overestimates the effective interest rate, resulting in higher interest expenses and a lower retained earnings amount. This means the carrying amount is overstated, as the bond's carrying value should reflect the expected future cash flows.\n\n(B) Understated: The straight-line method underestimates the effective interest rate, resulting in lower interest expenses and a higher retained earnings amount. This means the carrying amount is understated, as the bond's carrying value should reflect the expected future cash flows.\n\n(C) Overstated No effect: If the difference between the straight-line method and the effective interest method is minimal, the error has a negligible effect on the carrying amount and retained earnings amount.\n\n(D) No effect No effect: If the straight-line method and the effective interest method are the same, there is no error, and both the carrying amount and the retained earnings amount remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Understated.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, first we need to calculate the effective annual yield of the bond. We do this by annualizing the yield and then converting it to an effective annual yield.\n\n1. Annualize the yield:\nThe yield on a three-year bond is 5%, so the annualized yield would be:\n6% x (1 + 5%)\u00b2 = 6% x (1 + 25%) = 6% x 1.25 = 7.50%.\n2. Calculate the effective annual yield:\nThe effective annual yield takes into account the compounding effect of interest over the year. To convert the annualized yield to an effective annual yield, you can use a formula that takes into account the total number of times the interest will be compounded each year.\n\nAnnual Effective Yield = \\frac{(1 + interest\\_rate)^(1/n) - 1}{interest\\_rate}\n\nWhere:\n\n* n is the number of times the interest will be compounded each year\n* interest\\_rate is the annual interest rate\n3. Determine the appropriate number of times the interest will be compounded each year:\nWith a three-year bond, the interest will be compounded annually. So, n = 1.\n\nNow that we have the annual effective yield of 7.50%, we can use a financial calculator or look up the bond price on a bond pricing table/calculator. We'll focus on a few generic bond pricing tables, since there isn't enough information to provide specific bond pricing.\n\nLet's consider a bond pricing table that suggests the prices of bonds based on different annual effective yields and the face value. Typically, the table would have close to linear or slightly curved lines connecting bond prices at different yields.\n\nWith a 7.50% annual effective yield and a face value of $100, we would expect a price close to the table's line. However, this process requires visual inspection, and we do not have access to your specific bond pricing table. So, we must look for a \"ballpark\" answer based on typical bond pricing behavior.\n\nSolving this step-by-step for the price, we can choose the most reasonable options based on the steps to this answer, considering it mostly depends on general bond pricing trends for face values of $100.\n\nOption A: $100. This looks reasonable for a 7.50% annual effective yield and a face value of $100. Unfortunately, without a specific bond pricing table, we cannot determine the exact price.\n\nOption B: $104.29. This price is closer to one of the upper lines in a bond pricing table based on a 7.50% annual effective yield and a face value of $100.\n\nOption C: $96.71. This price is closer to one of the lower lines in a bond pricing table based on a 7.50% annual effective yield and a face value of $100.\n\nOption D: $97.33. This price is also closer to one of the lower lines in a bond pricing table based on a 7.50% annual effective yield and a face value of $100.\n\nConsidering the options and general bond pricing trends for face values of $100, we can choose the most reasonable output as the answer:\n\n(B) $104.29.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n$104.29.",
