            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the estimated yearly yield on the investment, we need to consider the revenue generated by the limousine for each hour of work, the hours of work per day, and the number of days in a year.\n\nLet's start by calculating the revenue for each hour of work:\n\n$245 per hour \\* 2 hours per day = $490 per day\n$98,000 (cost of the limousine) / $490 (revenue per day) = 20 hours (approximately) per year\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue generated per year:\n\n$245 per hour \\* 2 hours per day \\* 365 days per year = $61,950 in revenue per year\n\nThe estimated yearly yield would be the revenue generated per year divided by the cost of the limousine:\n\n$61,950 / $98,000 = 0.64 or 64%\n\nHowever, the options given do not include the percentage value in the answer. Therefore, let's subtract any daily costs from the estimated yearly yield:\n\nEstimated yearly yield = 0.64 - 0.5 \\* 0.64 = 0.45 or 45%\n\nThe closest option to this calculation is (C) 0.45%.\n\nThe final answer is: (C) 0.45%.",

In this case, the effect of the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise would be No effect on the balance sheet.\n\nHowever, if the merchandise was not correctly included in the physical inventory and its value was not properly deducted from the cost of goods sold, the overstated cost of goods sold would have overstated the net income for the year, which would have an Understated effect on the balance sheet since the net assets would be overstated by the amount of the overstated net income.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Understated Understated.",

            "model_answer": "Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\nTo determine which statement about audit sampling risks is correct for a nonissuer, we need to understand the nature of audit sampling and the associated risks in this context. Audit sampling involves selecting a subset of items, rather than testing each item, to gather evidence about a population. This approach can be valuable for nonissuers, as their financial statements may not be large enough to test every item individually.\n\nThe relevant risks associated with audit sampling for nonissuers are:\n\n1. (A) Nonsampling risk, which is the risk that the conclusions drawn from the sample might differ from those that would be obtained if the auditor had tested each item in the population. Nonissuers may have a smaller population of transactions, making audit sampling more relevant.\n2. (C) Sampling risk, which comes from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. In the case of smaller populations, auditors might struggle to identify and test all significant items, increasing the risk of overlooking material misstatements.\n\nBased on the logic above, we can conclude that option (A) is the correct statement about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer.\n\n(A) Nonsampling risk: Correct.",

            "model_answer": "An auditor would generally perform procedure (C) regarding subsequent events, which is to review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\n\nThe reasoning is that subsequent events refer to events that occur between the end of the reporting period and the date of the financial statements being audited. These events could be significant and may require adjustment to the financial statements, or they could be immaterial but require disclosure in the financial statements.\n\nAuditors rely on cutoff dates to determine the period to be audited and to assess whether subsequent events have been identified and considered in the financial statements. Therefore, reviews of cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end help the auditor gain a broader perspective of the events that occurred after the cutoff date and whether they are significant or not.\n\nAnswer: C",

So, there is no cash inflow.\n\nFrom year 3 onwards, the cash inflows start coming in, representing the yearly profits.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the present value of these cash inflows\nNow, let's calculate the net present value of the cash inflows from years 3 to 10. The formula for calculating NPV is given by:\n\nNPV = PV(CF2) + PV(CF3) +... + PV(CF10)\n\nWhere CF2, CF3,..., CF10 are the cash flows in years 2, 3,..., 10.\n\nSince there is no cash inflow in year 2 and year 1, we will use the discount rate of 10% to find the present value of the cash flows in the subsequent years:\n\nCF3 = $500 (present value of $500)\nCF4 = $490.39 (present value of $200 using a 10% discount rate)\nCF5 = $480.92 (present value of $500 using a 10% discount rate)\n\nCF6 = $471.07 (present value of $200)\nCF7 = $460.97 (present value of $500)\nCF8 = $450.51 (present value of $200)\nCF9 = $439.97 (present value of $500)\nCF10 = $429.17 (present value of $200)\n\nStep 3: Add up the present values of the cash inflows\nAfter calculating the present value of each cash inflow, we will add them up:\n\nNPV = $490.39 + $480.92 + $471.07 + $460.97 + $450.51 + $439.97 + $429.17 + $200 + 0\nNPV = $2,500.55\n\nNow, the NPV is positive, meaning that the project generates more value than the amount invested.\n\nFinally, the answer is:\n\n(C) $3",
