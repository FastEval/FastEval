The argument then goes on to explain the reason for this difficulty. The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes. Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion of the argument is that it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious and to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts due to the arrogance of our consciousness which blocks the unconscious complexes.\n\n(D) is the correct answer.",
