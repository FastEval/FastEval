            "question": "What is the structure of the United Nations Security Council?\n\n(A) 5 permanent members with veto power, 10 rotating members with no veto power\n(B) 5 permanent members and 10 rotating members, all with veto power\n(C) 10 permanent members with veto power, and 5 rotating members without veto power\n(D) 15 permanent members with veto power",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) is the correct answer. Here is the step-by-step reasoning for why:\n\nThe United Nations Security Council is the main decision-making body of the United Nations. It is responsible for maintaining international peace and security and approving any military action that is deemed necessary by the international community. Its current structure consists of 15 member states, five of which are permanent and ten of which are elected for two-year terms.\n\nRegarding the structure of the Security Council, there are two main categories of membership: permanent and non-permanent. Permanent members are also known as the P5: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They possess veto power, meaning they can block any resolution proposed by the Security Council. Non-permanent members do not possess veto power and can only vote on resolutions, not block them.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is the correct answer because it accurately describes the structure of the United Nations Security Council in terms of its permanent and non-permanent members, of whom some \u2014 such as China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States \u2014 possess veto power. Therefore, the answer is (A) 5 permanent members with veto power, 10 rotating members with no veto power.\n\n(5/15) \\* (A) + 10/(15) \\* (B) + 0/(15) \\* (C) + 0/(15) \\* (D) = 0.15",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The significance of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution was (A): it allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam.\n\nHere's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was a resolution passed by the United States Congress in 1964, following the Gulf of Tonkin incident, in which North Vietnamese naval vessels allegedly attacked US Navy ships.\n2. The resolution gave the President of the United States the authority to take action in Southeast Asia without a declaration of war or specific congressional approval.\n3. This allowed President Lyndon B. Johnson to increase US involvement in the Vietnam War, including the bombing of North Vietnam and the deployment of US troops, without facing significant objections from Congress.\n4. Therefore, the resolution increased US involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nNow the answer: (A)",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine which nonstate actor poses the greatest threat to the United States, we need to analyze each option and assess their capabilities, motivations, and actions against the U.S. and its interests.\n\n(A) Terrorists: Terrorist organizations such as ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and Hamas are known to target U.S. interests worldwide. While their capabilities may not match those of a nation-state, their determination and willingness to inflict mass casualties make them a serious threat.\n\n(B) Organized crime: Organized crime groups often engage in illegal activities such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and money laundering, which can have negative effects on the U.S. However, their focus is typically local or regional, and they do not pose an existential threat to the country.\n\n(C) Drug traffickers: Drug trafficking can contribute to violence and social problems in the U.S., but again, drug cartels and syndicates primarily focus on their own interests rather than challenging the U.S. directly.\n\n(D) China: While China is a significant economic and political player, it is generally considered a rival rather than an existential threat to the United States. Both nations have conflicting interests in various regions, but a full-scale war is highly unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Terrorists.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(B) is the correct answer.\n\nThe Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and its allies and the Soviet Union and its allies, which lasted from the end of World War II in 1945 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. During this time, the United States was often referred to as the \"leader of the free world,\" a term that reinforced the idea of American exceptionalism and its status as a global superpower.\n\nHowever, this global power also challenged core assumptions of American exceptionalism. As the United States extended its influence and power globally, it faced criticism from some quarters that its foreign policy was driven by imperial ambition, rather than a commitment to democracy and freedom. The Cold War also highlighted the limitations of American power, as the United States was unable to prevent the spread of communism in countries such as Cuba, Vietnam, and Nicaragua, challenging the belief in American exceptionalism that the United States was invulnerable to external threats.\n\nOverall, the Cold War had a complex impact on American exceptionalism, with the idea of American exceptionalism being both reinforced and challenged by the global power and influence of the United States during this time.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(C) He always favoured isolationism\n\nExplanation:\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt initially favored an \"isolationist\" stance on the part of the US during the 1930s for several reasons:\n\n1. He believed that neutrality was in the best interest of the United States: President Roosevelt believed that staying out of the conflict between the Axis powers and the Allies would minimize American involvement in World War II.\n2. He had campaigned on the theme of avoiding entanglements: During his presidential campaigns and prior to his presidency, Roosevelt had consistently argued against foreign entanglements and interventionism, which catered to the prevailing anti-interventionist sentiment of many Americans.\n3. He was mindful of public opinion: Roosevelt was keenly aware of the public's desire to avoid entanglement in foreign conflicts. As a result, he initially sought to focus on domestic issues and avoid foreign entanglements that could risk alienating the American public.\n\nIn summary, Roosevelt favored an isolationist stance during the 1930s due to his belief in neutrality, his campaign promises, and his commitment to public opinion.",

            "model_answer": "(D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy.\n\nExplanation:\n(D) is the correct answer because of the tremendous war spending by European countries during World War I. To finance their war efforts, European countries issued loans and bonds, which were mainly bought by the United States. As a result, the United States became the biggest creditor nation and financial centre in the world. This helped to shift economic power from Europe to the United States, particularly in the 1920s and 1930s, when the US economy was booming and Europe was struggling. Additionally, US businesses and banks gained significant control over resources and markets in Europe, further consolidating the US's economic power.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\nTo determine the power to declare war in American government, we need to look at the Constitution of the United States and the relevant sections that provide information on this topic. Starting with Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, we can see that Congress has the power to declare war: \"The Congress shall have Power...To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.\" This suggests an answer of (D) Congress.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the power to declare war is not entirely in the hands of Congress; the president also has some involvement in the process. According to Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution, the president is required to \"communique(s)\" Congress that a state of war exists. This means that while Congress has the power to declare war, the president is responsible for officially notifying Congress of any military action. Hence, rather than choosing (A), (B), or (C), the most accurate answer is (D), as Congress has the power to declare war but the president has the responsibility to inform Congress of the existence of a state of war.",
