            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(C) A lower level of education\n\nExplanation:\nThe risk of developing Alzheimer's is lower in individuals with a higher level of education due to the following reasons:\n\n(C) A lower level of education => Lower level of education is generally associated with a lower level of cognitive function and learning, which can lead to a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. However, it is worth noting that education level alone cannot predict an individual's risk of Alzheimer's. Other factors such as age, genetics, and lifestyle choices also play a role in the development of the disease.\n\n(A) Being African or Hispanic American is not related to a decreased risk of Alzheimer's.\n\n(B) Eating fish can be associated with a slightly decreased risk of Alzheimer's, but this is not a well-established factor.\n\n(D) Being married does not have a significant association with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's or any other form of dementia. In fact, being married may actually increase the risk of developing dementia in some cases.",

            "model_answer": "The docility hypothesis is that those with low capabilities are more vulnerable to environmental demands. This statement implies that individuals with lower capabilities are less able to adapt or cope with the demands placed on them by their environment.\n\nTo better understand this hypothesis, consider a situation in which an individual with high capabilities is faced with similar environmental demands as an individual with low capabilities. The individual with high capabilities may be better equipped to handle these demands due to their increased abilities and resources. However, if they experience high environmental demands, they may become more docile because they are more able to adapt to these demands. On the other hand, the individual with low capabilities may not be as able to adapt, and may therefore become more vulnerable to environmental demands.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the docility hypothesis is supported by the statement \"Those with low capabilities are more vulnerable to environmental demands\".\n\nThe answer is (A) Those with low capabilities are more vulnerable to environmental demands.",

            "question": "Normal memory seems to be improved by\n\n(A) Aerobic exercise\n(B) Taking acetylcholine\n(C) Taking gingko\n(D) Increasing social contacts",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer to this question is (B) for taking acetylcholine. Below is the explanation for this answer.\n\nStep 1: Understand the different types of memory\nThere are three main types of memory: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Sensory memory deals with the initial reception of sensory information, short-term memory is responsible for storing information temporarily, and long-term memory refers to the permanent storage of information that lasts over time.\n\nStep 2: Identify the benefits of taking acetylcholine\nAcetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that helps in the communication between neurons in the brain. Its benefits for the brain and memory are as follows:\n\n(A) Aerobic exercise - Mental activities associated with moderate to high intensity physical exercise have been linked to increased aerobic exercise performance.\n(C) Taking gingko - Gingko biloba is a plant extract that may help improve cognitive function, particularly memory. However, the evidence is mixed, and its effectiveness varies.\n\nStep 3: Relate the benefit to the chosen substance\nTaking acetylcholine supplements or increasing acetylcholine-boosting activities might help improve sensory memory by strengthening the connections between neurons in the brain, leading to a better encoding and storing of sensory information. While there isn't sufficient evidence to support direct benefits of acetylcholine supplementation, certain lifestyle changes that increase acetylcholine levels indirectly, such as exercise, might have a positive impact on memory.\n\nStep 4: Opt for the closest option\nGiven the limited (B) option, it's reasonable to assume that taking acetylcholine might improve memory, but the extent of its effectiveness is not directly stated, and other factors like (A) and (C) might also play a role. Thus, the answer to this question is (B) taking acetylcholine (though it's important to note that more research is needed to confirm this directly).",

The argument is that one's environment plays a critical role in shaping a person's behavior, personality, and psychological traits, while their genetic makeup also plays a significant role. Therefore, both play an important role.\n\nTherefore, the solution is (D) All of these questions, which also includes Mechanistic vs organismic, Continuity vs. discontinuity.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(A) It becomes thicker\n\nThe lens of the eye is responsible for focusing light on the retina, which is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. As we age, the lens can gradually become less flexible, which can lead to difficulty focusing on close objects. However, the lens does not typically become thicker as we age.\n\nYellowing of the lens can occur as a result of aging and exposure to UV light, but it does not typically occur as the lens thickens. Clouding of the lens can occur as a result of a cataract, which is a condition where the lens becomes cloudy and makes it difficult to see. But it does not typically occur as the lens becomes thicker.\n\nThe lens does fill with fluid as we age, this fluid is called temporarily accumulation of aqueous humor within the lens. This happens to help us focus on near objects, and it's a normal part of the ageing process, however, it is not mentioned in the question.\n\nThe lens becoming thicker would be an unusual occurrence as we age. Hence, option A does not usually occur to the lens of the eye as one grows older.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step-by-step explanation:\n\nThe question refers to a hypothetical concept of houses that can be operated virtually from a central terminal, similar to a computer interface. This idea is not entirely unfamiliar, as modern smart homes are equipped with various automated systems and can be controlled using a centralized interface, such as a smartphone app or a dedicated control panel.\n\nThere are several reasons that suggest this concept aligns more closely with (C) Futurehouse than options (A) Technohouse, (B) Compuhouse, or (D) Smarthouse:\n\n1. The term \"Futurehouse\" suggests a forward-looking concept that embodies advancements in technology and connectivity. The idea of a smart, IoT-enabled house that can be operated remotely through a central terminal aligns with this concept.\n2. Option (B) \"Compuhouse\" suggests a more generic term for a house equipped with computers, which could encompass both modern smart homes and traditional computers. The question focuses more on a central terminal or interface for operating the house as opposed to a predominantly tech-focused structure.\n3. Option (A) \"Technohouse\" is a broad term that could potentially encompass any house with tech-related features, regardless of how they are operated. However, this term does not accurately convey the centralized remote control aspect described in the question.\n4. Option (D) \"Smarthouse\" is already in use to describe a smart, IoT-enabled home. While it is a more appropriate term than (A) or (B), it might be considered too generic to accurately convey the specific concept described in the question.\n\nGiven the reasoning above, the correct answer is (C) Futurehouse, as it best captures the idea of a house enabled by future technology, with a centralized interface for remote control and automation.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The reaction time difference between younger and older adults is reduced when older adults (A) Practice regular aerobic exercise.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAs individuals age, their reaction time tends to slow down due to a variety of factors such as reduced reflexes, slower processing speed, and declining cognitive abilities. Regular aerobic exercise has been shown to be an effective way to counteract these age-related declines in reaction time. Aerobic exercise, such as running or biking, requires the coordination of several body systems including the central nervous system, and improves overall fitness, which can lead to improved reaction time.\n\nOn the other hand, lifting weights on a regular schedule (B) and consuming large quantities of vitamins (C) may have a negligible effect on reaction time and may not be the best ways to improve it. Tai chi (D) is a form of exercise that involves slow, graceful movements, and has been found to improve balance and flexibility, but it may not be as effective in improving reaction time.\n\nTherefore, the option that best reduces the reaction time difference between younger and older adults is (A) Practice regular aerobic exercise.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C). Programmed theories of senescence claim that senescence follows a predetermined plan, which means that there is a specific set of genetic instructions that determine the aging process. In contrast, unprogrammed theories of senescence propose that the aging process is the result of an accumulation of damage or wear and tear on cells over time.\n\nTo explain the reasoning step-by-step, here are some definitions:\n\n* Programmed theories of senescence propose that the aging process is the result of a predetermined plan or set of genetic instructions.\n* Unprogrammed theories of senescence propose that the aging process is the result of an accumulation of damage or wear and tear on cells over time.\n\nGiven these definitions, we can see that the main difference between programmed and unprogrammed theories of senescence is the underlying mechanism that drives the aging process. Programmed theories propose that the aging process follows a specific set of instructions, while unprogrammed theories suggest that the aging process is the result of a gradual accumulation of damage.\n\nOption (C) accurately reflects this difference. Programmed theories of senescence do claim that the aging process follows a predetermined plan. Option (A) attributes senescence only to environmental factors, which is not a defining characteristic of programmed or unprogrammed theories of senescence. Option (B) is incorrect because programmed theories can be difficult to test in some cases, just like any other scientific theory. Option (D) is incorrect because programmed theories rely on computer models to simulate the aging process and make predictions, which is a common tool used in biology and other fields.",
