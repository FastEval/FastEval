            "question": "The weight of an aspirin tablet is 300 milligrams according to the bottle label. An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim. Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(B) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n(D) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The first step is to find the sample mean and standard deviation of the sample weights. The sample mean can be calculated by adding all the weights together and then dividing by the number of weights in the sample:\n\nSample mean = (299 + 300 + 305 + 302 + 299 + 301 + 303) / 7 = 299.4286\n\nSince we have a large sample with three or more observations, we can use the t-distribution instead of the standard normal distribution. The t-value can be calculated by taking the difference between the sample mean and the null hypothesis mean and then dividing by the sample standard deviation:\n\nt = (299.4286 - 300) / sqrt(5.1048) = 1.54\n\nNow we can set up the null and alternative hypotheses:\n\nH0: \u03bc = 300 (the true average weight of the tablets is 300 grams)\nHa: \u03bc \u2260 300 (the true average weight of the tablets is not 300 grams)\n\nTo find the P-value, we can use a t-distribution table or a calculator. The P-value is the probability of observing a sample result as extreme or more extreme than what we observed under the null hypothesis. In this case, the P-value is the probability of getting a t-score of 1.54 or more.\n\nFrom a t-distribution table, we can find that the P-value for a left tail is 0.290. This means that if we were to randomly draw a sample of this size from a population with the same mean and standard deviation, we would expect to observe a sample result as extreme or more extreme than this 2.3% of the time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is P-value = 0.290, rounded to two decimal places.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\nP-value = 0.290",

            "question": "The waiting times for a new roller coaster ride are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes.

            "model_answer": "To find the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders, we need to first calculate the probability of waiting times less than 25 minutes. We can do this by finding the area under the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution to the right of 25 minutes, and then calculating one minus the probability.\n\nThe CDF of a normal distribution is given by:\n\nF(x) = (1 / sqrt(2 \\* \u03c0)) \\* exp(-((x - mu)^2) / (sigma^2))\n\nwhere mu is the mean of the waiting times and sigma is the standard deviation of the waiting times.\n\nFor the given waiting times, mu = 35, sigma = 10. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\nF(x) = (1 / sqrt(2 \\* \u03c0)) \\* exp(-((x - 35)^2) / (10^2))\n\nComputing this expression with a calculator gives:\n\nF(x) \u2248 0.3792\n\nTo find the probability of waiting times between 25 and 35 minutes, we need to subtract the CDF at 25 minutes from 1:\n\nP(25 < x < 35) = F(35) - F(25) \u2248 0.5387\n\nNow, we can find the area to the right of 35 minutes in the cumulative distribution function:\n\nF(35) = (1 / sqrt(2 \\* \u03c0)) \\* exp(-((35 - 35)^2) / (10^2)) \u2248 0.9951\n\nThe area to the right of 35 minutes, one-sided, is given by:\n\n1 - P(25 < x < 35) = 1 - 0.5387 \u2248 0.4613\n\nNow, we can find the probability of waiting times less than or equal to 23 minutes, which corresponds to the shortest time interval in the question:\n\nP(23 < x <= 25) = P(23 < x < 35) - P(x <= 25)\n\nP(23 < x < 35) = 0.5387\nP(x <= 25) = 0.4613\n\nSubstituting these probabilities into the equation, we get:\n\nP(23 < x <= 25) = 0.5387 - 0.4613 \u2248 0.0774\n\nFinally, we can calculate the shortest time interval in question C by converting the probability of waiting times less than or equal to 23 minutes into minutes:\n\n(P(23 < x <= 25)) / 60 \u2248 0.0774 / 60 \u2248 0.01283\n\nSo, the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is approximately 12.83 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B) 31.7 to 39.3 minutes.",

When the sample size is large, the test statistic follows a normal distribution. If the test statistic provides sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at a given level, then it provides the same level of evidence at a higher level, given a larger sample size.\n\nFor example, if the test statistic provides sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at a 10% level, then there is a 95% chance of rejecting it at a 5% level and a 90% chance of rejecting it at a 1% level.\n\n(B) Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.\n\nThe choice of the null hypothesis depends on the direction of the alternative hypothesis. If the alternative hypothesis is unidirectional (e.g., the population mean is greater than 5), then a one-tailed test is appropriate. If the alternative hypothesis is bidirectional (e.g., the population mean is between 2 and 7), then a two-tailed test is appropriate.
