            "question": "The weight of an aspirin tablet is 300 milligrams according to the bottle label. An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim. Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(B) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n(D) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to perform the hypothesis test and calculate the P-value. We can start by assuming that the weights of the tablets are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with a mean of 300 milligrams and a known standard deviation. Let's denote the sample mean as x\u0304 = \u2211(xi/n) for i = 1 to 7 where xi is the weight of the ith tablet, and n is the sample size of 7.\n\nWe know that the FDA investigator collected a simple random sample, so the sample will have a homogeneous distribution of the population. The population mean weight is the claimed manufacturer's weight, which is 300 milligrams, denoted as \u03bb = 300.\n\nWe can now state the null and alternative hypotheses:\nH0: \u03bb = 300 (the manufacturer's claim)\nHa: \u03bb \u2260 300 (the weights are not the manufacturer's claim)\n\nNext, we need to find the test statistic for the hypothesis test. We will use the t-test with the continuity correction since our sample size is small (n = 7). The test statistic is calculated as:\n\nt = (x\u0304 - \u03bb) / (s / sqrt(n))\n\nwhere s is the sample standard deviation, which we assume to know at the beginning. We use the continuity correction to make the t-distribution more accurate when the sample size is small.\n\nPlugging in the values, we have:\n\nt = (300 - 300) / (s / sqrt(7)) = 0\n\nThe calculated value of the test statistic is 0.00, which is close to zero. Since the test statistic is close to zero, we will use the normal approximation to the t-distribution to find the P-value. We've used the asymptotic critical value method with df = 6, since our sample size is small (n = 7).\n\nUsing the software, the P-value of the hypothesis test is between 0.01 and 0.06.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which of the given statements is a true statement about hypothesis testing, it is important to understand key concepts related to hypothesis testing.\n\n(A) If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level.\n\nThis statement is false. The level of significance refers to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. A higher level of significance corresponds to a lower probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, while a lower level of significance corresponds to a higher probability of rejecting the null hypothesis. Therefore, if sufficient evidence exists to reject the null hypothesis at a 10% level, it does not necessarily mean that the same level of evidence would be sufficient to reject the null hypothesis at a 5% level, as the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis at the higher level is lower.\n\n(B) Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.\n\nThis statement is true. Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered. A one-sided test is used when the researcher is interested in either a left or a right-skewed population parameter. A two-sided test is used when the researcher is interested in both left and right-skewed population parameters. The choice of which type of test to use is not inherently related to the level of evidence, and thus does not affect the decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis.\n\n(C) If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nThis statement is true. If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis. A higher level of significance results in a lower probability of rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\n(D) The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\n\nThis statement is true. The power of a hypothesis test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. A test with higher power is more likely to detect an alternative hypothesis, while a test with lower power is less likely to detect an alternative hypothesis, even if there is a true difference between the two populations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D): The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.",
