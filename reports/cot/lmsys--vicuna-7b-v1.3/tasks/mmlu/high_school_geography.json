            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically is the lack of (A) a currency.\n\nExplanation:\nSubsistence economies are characterized by the production of basic goods and services for local consumption and a lack of surplus for trade. In such economies, there is typically no formal currency and transactions are conducted through barter or the direct exchange of goods and services. The lack of a currency can make it difficult for subsistence economies to engage in trade and to accumulate capital for investment in infrastructure and other development projects. Additionally, the use of barter or direct exchange can be associated with inefficiencies, such as a lack of comparability and difficulty in obtaining precise measurements.\n\nThe role of a currency in facilitating trade and exchange is essential for economic development. It allows for the exchange of goods and services across different regions and helps to establish fair prices for goods. The use of a currency enables the accumulation of capital and enables investment in infrastructure and other development projects. In contrast, subsistence economies that rely on barter or direct exchange often lack the infrastructure and capital needed to sustain economic growth over the long-term.\n\nTherefore, (A) a currency is the main factor that prevents subsistence economies from advancing economically.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) demographic momentum.\n\nHere's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n* Demographic momentum refers to the continuous growth of a population beyond the point where replacement fertility is achieved.\n* This tendency can be observed when a population experiences a substantial increase in size due to factors such as high fertility rates, migration, or declining mortality rates.\n* If fertility rates remain high or increase, the positive demographic momentum can continue even after replacement fertility has been achieved, resulting in continued population growth.\n* However, it's important to note that demographic momentum is not synonymous with rapid growth rate, which would be denoted by the answer choice (B). Rapid growth rate suggests an increase in population size that is faster than the current rate of growth, while demographic momentum refers to the continuous growth resulting from factors such as high fertility rates and migration.\n* Zero population growth, denoted by the answer choice (A), implies that the population size is constant and does not change over time. This is opposite to the tendency for continuing growth observed with demographic momentum.\n* Homeostatic plateau, also denoted by the answer choice (C), refers to a population that has stabilized at a specific level and is not projected to change significantly over time. This is different from the continuous growth observed with demographic momentum.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) demographic momentum.",

            "question": "The tendency for migration to decrease with distance is called\n\n(A) push factors.\n(B) pull factors.\n(C) distance decay.\n(D) migration selectivity.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The tendency for migration to decrease with distance is called pull factors. Pull factors are attractive forces that encourage people to migrate, such as better job opportunities, higher pay, or more favorable living conditions. As the distance between the origin and destination increases, the pull factors that encourage migration become weaker, and the positive benefits that motivated the migration become less attractive. Conversely, push factors that encourage people to stay or migrate away from their origin increase in importance, making the decision to migrate more complex.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B): pull factors.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia.\n\nExplanation:\n(A) Most women work in agriculture is not necessarily true as the labor force is broader than agriculture, it mostly includes industrial and services sectors, in many regions the agriculture only employs a small number of the population. Therefore, (A) is false.\n\n(B) The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide. This statement is true, as women's labor force participation has been declining in many countries, which means that the percentage of women in the labor force has decreased.\n\n(C) The percentage of women in the total labor force declined. This statement is false, as the percentage of women in the labor force has been declining, but not necessarily in the total labor force.\n\n(D) Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia. This statement is true, as women tend to spend more hours per day working than men due to various reasons such as caregiving responsibilities and women's average longer gap in education. However, it is important to note that the hours of work are not the only way to measure the contribution of women to the labor force.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which factor among A, B, C, and D can be considered a pull factor of migration, we need to identify what specifically attracts individuals or groups of people to move from their current location to a different place.\n\nThe term \"pull factor\" refers to an attribute of a particular location that encourages people to migrate from their original location to the destination.\n\nA) Safety (i.e. the perception of a low crime rate and general safety) is a commonly cited pull factor for migration. People are more likely to move to a location where they feel safe and protected.\n\n(B) Better climate is also often considered a pull factor as it can affect people's quality of life, especially for those who enjoy outdoor activities or are sensitive to temperature.\n\n(C) Better schools can be a significant pull factor for migration as it can improve the economic and educational opportunities for individuals and their families.\n\n(D) Overcrowding, or the presence of too many people in a certain area, may be a push factor for migration. If people feel that there are too few resources available or that the area is too crowded, they may be more likely to leave.\n\nTherefore, (D) overcrowding is the correct answer.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To identify which of the given countries does NOT have a well-known example of a relict boundary, we need to understand what a relict boundary is. A relict boundary is a boundary between two tectonic plates that has been relatively stable for a long time. This means that the two plates have been moving away from each other at a constant rate, which can result in the formation of a boundary that is different from the typical boundary between two plates.\n\nNow let's examine each of the given countries:\n\n(A) Vietnam - It is not clear whether Vietnam has a well-known example of a relict boundary or not.\n\n(B) United Kingdom - The United Kingdom is an archipelago, which means it is made up of numerous islands. There are three main tectonic plates that affect the United Kingdom, and it is likely that there are some relict boundaries in the region.\n\n(C) Germany - Germany is located in the geologically active region of Central Europe, where there are several tectonic plates. There are likely to be relict boundaries in the region, although it is not possible to know for sure without conducting research.\n\n(D) Bolivia - Bolivia is a landlocked country in South America. It is not clear whether there are any relict boundaries in Bolivia, as there are several active tectonic plates in the region.\n\nCombining the information from the previous paragraphs, we can say that the country that does NOT have a well-known example of a relict boundary is probably Vietnam, given that there is not enough information available to make a definitive statement about the other countries.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(A) Vietnam - no relict boundary.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer to the question can be found by analyzing the characteristics of farm workers who are likely to migrate from another country. Let's consider the potential factors that may influence their migration patterns:\n\n(A) Chain migration:\nChain migration, also known as co-migration, typically refers to a chain reaction where a person moves to a new location and brings along family members, friends, or acquaintances. Factors like family ties, cultural familiarity, and job opportunities may influence chain migration.\n\n(B) Cluster migration:\nCluster migration refers to a group of people from the same social, cultural, or economic background migrating together. This type of migration is often seen in farm labor camps, where temporary farm workers live together in limited housing or camps. People may migrate in clusters to maintain cultural ties or for the sake of convenience.\n\n(C) Circular migration:\nCircular migration is a pattern of temporary international migration where people move between a country of origin and a country of destination for work, keeping the migrant \"circular\" in their country of residence. Agriculture is one sector known for circular migration patterns, as migrants often return to their home countries after the harvest season.\n\n(D) International migration:\nInternational migration refers to people moving between countries for various reasons, including employment, education, family reunification, and political asylum. While it is possible for farm workers to engage in international migration, it is not as common as the other forms of migration described above.\n\nBased on the analysis of the characteristics of farm workers and their potential migration patterns, the answer is:\n\n(B) Cluster migration\n\n\u03c0) B.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine which option is a centrifugal force in a country, it is important to understand the meaning of centrifugal force. Centrifugal force is a fictitious force that appears to act in a direction away from the center of a rotating reference frame. In the context of a country, it can be perceived as a force working against the cohesion and stability of the nation, either due to internal or external factors.\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Religious differences: Religious differences can certainly contribute to divisions within a country, but they are more accurately referred to as a centripetal force, as they tend to pull people together.\n\n(B) A national holiday: A national holiday is a celebratory event that brings people together. While it might create temporary feelings of unity, it is not a centrifugal force in the traditional sense.\n\n(C) An attack by another country: An aggressive action by another country can indeed create tensions and divisions within a country, which could be interpreted as a centrifugal force. However, this would depend on the reaction and response of the nation's leadership and citizens.\n\n(D) A charismatic national leader: A charismatic leader could either bring people together or push them apart. If their leadership is able to unify the country and resolve conflicts, a charismatic leader could be seen as a centripetal force. On the other hand, if their leadership style is divisive or ineffective, they might instead create centrifugal forces.\n\nAfter careful consideration of each option, it seems that the closest fit to a centrifugal force in a country is (C) An attack by another country. While this may not be the most common or straightforward example, it does represent a significant force that can potentially work against the stability and unity of a country.\n\nC is the answer with parenthesis.",
