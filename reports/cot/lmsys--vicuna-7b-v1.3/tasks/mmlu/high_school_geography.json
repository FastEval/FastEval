            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(A) a currency.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA subsistence economy is characterized by a simple way of life, with basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter being the primary focus. There is typically little economic activity beyond the basic subsistence needs of the population.\n\nIn this type of economy, there is often a lack of specialization and division of labor, which can limit the potential for economic growth. The lack of a currency makes it difficult to trade goods and services with other communities, as bartering can be cumbersome.\n\nIn contrast, a currency provides a standard way of measuring the value of goods and services, making trade between communities easier and more efficient. Without a currency, it can be difficult for communities to exchange goods and services, limiting the potential for economic growth.\n\n(B) a well-connected transportation infrastructure is important for economic development as it allows for the efficient movement of goods and people, but it is not as essential for economic growth as the development of a currency.\n\n(C) government activity can be an important factor in economic development, but it is not as essential as the development of a currency.\n\n(D) a banking service can be important for facilitating economic activity, but it is not as essential as the development of a currency.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The tendency for a population to continue to grow long after replacement fertility has been achieved is called demographic momentum.\n\nTo understand why, let's first define what replacement fertility is. Replacement fertility is the overall fertility rate that is needed to maintain a stable population level over the long term. It is the average number of children a woman receives during her lifetime to replace herself and her husband.\n\nNow, let's consider the concept of demographic momentum. When a population's growth rate rises above the replacement rate, it has a momentum effect that sustains population growth when fertility drops below the replacement rate. This momentum is driven by a combination of factors, such as a high proportion of youth in the population and a long-term trend of rapid population growth due to factors such as health improvements and educational attainment.\n\nAs a result of these factors, the population experiences continued growth even as fertility falls below the replacement rate. This phenomenon is referred to as demographic momentum.\n\n(D) demographic momentum.",

            "model_answer": "The decrease in migration as a function of distance is known as the concept of distance decay. The closer the distance between the two locations, the more likely it is for individuals to migrate from one location to another. This is due to various factors, including geographical barriers, economic opportunities, social networks, and cultural factors that make the distance between the two locations less appealing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) distance decay.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The concentric zone model of urban form, proposed by Sir Peter Hall and Andrew G. Geddes, divides a city into zones based on their degree of centrality, with each zone exhibiting a distinct level of advantage or deprivation. According to this model, the inner zone (Zone 1) contains the city's highest concentration of resources and is generally associated with upper-class neighborhoods. The outer zone (Zone 4) experiences urban decay and contains low-income neighborhoods such as low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration.\n\nBased on this information, the zone that contains low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration is the outer zone (Zone 4).

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide.\n\nThe first step in answering this question is to understand the meaning of the terms \"women in the labor force\" and \"economically active.\" Women in the labor force are individuals who engage in economic activity by working or seeking work. Economically active women are those who are working or actively searching for work.\n\nFrom this definition, statement (B) is the statement that is true concerning women in the labor force. It states that the percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide. This decline in percentage of women economically active in the labor force can be due to various reasons such as social, economic, or cultural factors that limit women's access to employment.\n\nOn the other hand, (A) is incorrect as it suggests that most women work in agriculture, which is not true in most parts of the world where agriculture is not the major source of employment for women. (C) is also incorrect as it suggests that the percentage of women in the total labor force declined, but without specifying if this decline is worldwide or just in certain regions. (D) is also incorrect as it suggests that women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia, but it does not specify whether the percentage of women economically active in the labor force has declined or not.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is (B) The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To identify the country that does NOT have a well-known example of a relict boundary, we need to first understand what a relict boundary is. A relict boundary, also known as a forearc break, is part of the boundary between an active continental margin and an oceanic trench. It is a type of plate boundary that is characterized by the presence of volcanic and seismic activity, as well as the uplift and erosion of the sea floor.\n\nNow, let's take a closer look at each of the countries listed:\n\n(A) Vietnam - Vietnam is part of the Eurasian plate, which is converging with the Indochinese plate at a rate of approximately 6-7 cm/year. This convergent boundary is characterized by the presence of seismic activity and the development of volcanic arcs. While there are a number of smaller accretionary wedges and reverse faults in the country, there is no known relict boundary.\n\n(B) United Kingdom - The United Kingdom is part of the Eurasian plate, which is converging with the North Atlantic plate at a rate of approximately 4-5 cm/year. This convergent boundary is characterized by the presence of seismic activity and the development of volcanic arcs. The UK includes three main island groups (England, Scotland, and Wales), each of which is affected by a complex network of reverse and normal faults. There are no identified relict boundaries in the UK.\n\n(C) Germany - Germany is part of the Eurasian plate, which is converging with the African plate at a rate of approximately 6-7 cm/year. This convergent boundary is characterized by the presence of seismic activity and the development of volcanic arcs. In Germany, there are several examples of relict boundaries, such as the Northern Black Forest Syncline.\n\n(D) Bolivia - Bolivia is part of the Nazca plate, which is diverging from the South American plate at a rate of approximately 6-7 mm/year. This divergent boundary is characterized by the formation of a large number of small volcanoes and the development of rift-related structures, but there is no well-known example of a relict boundary in the country.\n\nSo, the country that does NOT have a well-known example of a relict boundary is Bolivia.",
