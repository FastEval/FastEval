            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "To determine the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation, we need to consider the patient's history, symptoms, and examination results.\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization is highly unlikely as the patient did not report the tingling and numbness during the hospitalization, and the examination shows no abnormalities in the skin or muscle strength.\n\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement could be a possibility as the patient had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage and placement of an IVC filter. However, this is not a known complication of IVC filter placement and is not consistent with the patient's history.\n\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is a possible cause of the patient's symptoms. This is consistent with the patient's reported symptoms and the examination findings of decreased sensation to light touch over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh.\n\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh is also possible, but it is less likely as the patient had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital two weeks ago.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is (C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.",

She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The most likely diagnosis in this case is (A) Braxton Hicks contractions.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe patient is in active labor at 39 weeks of gestation, with irregular and weak contractions. This is not consistent with Braxton Hicks contractions, which are typically described as painless, a loose feeling in the abdomen that comes and goes. They are usually felt more frequently and are more noticeable in the third trimester. The irregularity of contractions supports the other diagnoses that could be the cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\nAdditionally, Braxton Hicks contractions do not cause the cervix to dilate and efface, and they do not require pain medication. The uterine fundus is normally at least 2 cm above the level of the symphysis pubis, but it can be lower in pregnancies of 39 weeks. The position of the fundus is also a clue to the diagnosis, as a lower fundus suggests decreased amniotic fluid volume, which could indicate rupture of the membranes, or could be due to other causes such as a pathological affected placenta.\n\nTherefore, the symptoms and examination findings do not support any other diagnosis, making Braxton Hicks contractions the most likely diagnosis for this patient.\n\nAnswer: A",

Increasing malonyl-CoA concentration in the resting state of healthy subjects does not necessarily inhibit fatty acid oxidation.\n\n(B) Fatty acid synthesis: While it is true that malonyl-CoA is an essential intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, an increased concentration of malonyl-CoA is usually associated with decreased fatty acid synthesis due to the rate-limiting nature of malonyl-CoA in the reaction.\n\n(C) Gluconeogenesis: Malonyl-CoA is not a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Although increased malonyl-CoA concentration may affect the balance of metabolic pathways in the body, this does not directly inhibit gluconeogenesis.\n\n(D) Glycogenolysis: Malonyl-CoA is not an intermediate in glycogenolysis. It is not likely that the increased concentration of malonyl-CoA in muscle biopsy specimens will directly inhibit glycogenolysis.\n\nGiven the information provided and the metabolic pathways associated with each of the options, the only process that directly inhibits fatty acid oxidation is option (A): Fatty acid oxidation.
