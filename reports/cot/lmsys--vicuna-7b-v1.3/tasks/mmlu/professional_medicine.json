            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation, we will first consider each potential option and rule out others as necessary.\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization - This is unlikely because the patient had no symptoms or signs of a cerebral infarction during her hospitalization.\n\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement - While complications from IVC filter placement can occur, this is not typically associated with decreased sensation in a specific area of the leg. Other complications, such as filter migration or embolization, may be more prominent symptoms.\n\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve - This is a likely possibility, as compression of the nerve in the area of the patient's symptoms could lead to decreased sensation in the affected area. However, we would also need to consider other potential causes, such as nerve injury or nerve inflammation.\n\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh - While the patient did have a hematoma that resolved on discharge from the hospital, this is unlikely to be the cause of the current symptoms as the hematoma was resolved and there is no mention of it causing persistent sensory symptoms.\n\nBased on the available information, the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is (C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.",

These findings, along with the absence of the other conditions listed, support the diagnosis of primary dysfunctional labor.\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions are mild contractions that occur in late pregnancy and are used by the body to practice for labor.\n\n(B) Lower uterine retraction ring is usually seen in advanced pregnancy and is not the most likely diagnosis at 39 weeks' gestation.\n\n(C) Hypotonic uterine dysfunction is when the uterus is too relaxed, and this is more likely seen during labor.\n\nSo, the answer would be (D) primary dysfunctional labor.",

During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?\n\n(A) Median nerve at the wrist\n(B) Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm\n(C) Radial nerve at the forearm\n(D) Ulnar nerve at the elbow",

            "model_answer": "To determine the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms, we need to consider the anatomy of the nerves that innervate the hand and the regions where they are most likely to be entrapped.\n\nThe median nerve, which supplies sensation to the palm and fingers in the midline of the hand, passes through a tight space at the wrist known as the carpal tunnel. Entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist, also known as carpal tunnel syndrome, can cause symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and pain in the hand.\n\nThe musculocutaneous nerve, which supplies sensation to the little finger and some of the fingers in the lateral aspect of the hand, passes through the rotational foramen, which is located at the level of the elbow. Entrapment of the musculocutaneous nerve at the elbow, also known as Little's syndrome, can cause symptoms similar to those described in this patient.\n\nThe radial nerve, which supplies motor function to the muscles in the back of the hand, including those responsible for extension of the fingers, passes through the radial groove, which is located at the lateral aspect of the elbow. Entrapment of the radial nerve at the elbow can cause symptoms such as numbness and tingling in the back of the hand and weakness in finger extension.\n\nThe ulnar nerve, which supplies motor function to the muscles in the front of the hand and sensation to the little finger, passes through the cubital tunnel, which is located at the medial aspect of the elbow. Entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow, also known as cubital tunnel syndrome, can cause symptoms similar to those described in this patient.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms of numbness and tingling in the right ring and small fingers and the severity of pain in response to palpation at the elbow, the most likely cause of her symptoms is entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Ulnar nerve at the elbow.",

In hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, glucose uptake is increased, and insulin secretion is increased, which leads to reduced fatty acid oxidation. The increased glucose uptake results in increased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and fatty acids are taken up by the muscle cells instead of being oxidized. This leads to the accumulation of fatty acids and the resulting decrease in malonyl-CoA concentration. As a consequence, fatty acid oxidation inhibited due to the availability of fatty acids for oxidation.",
