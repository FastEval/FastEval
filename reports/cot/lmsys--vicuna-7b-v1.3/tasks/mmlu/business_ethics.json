            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe given statement that \"_______ such as bitcoin are becoming increasingly mainstream and have a whole host of associated ethical implications\" could be applied better to option (A) than to option (B), (C), or (D). Option (A) correctly states that cryptocurrencies are becoming mainstream and have associated ethical implications of being expensive and secure and engaging in financial crime. Option (B) is not accurate because it states that traditional currencies are cheap but unsecure, and that they engage in charitable giving. Option (C) is not accurate because it states that cryptocurrencies are cheap and secure but engage in financial crime. Option (D) is not accurate because it states that traditional currencies are expensive and unsecure, and that they engage in charitable giving.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.",

            "model_answer": "(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious.\n\nAs an AI language model, I wouldn't use typical advertising regulations, but I can provide guidance on what to look for. While creating advertising content, considerations such as accuracy, fairness, and responsible marketing are important principles to follow. All the options seem to address these aspects, and none of them explicitly promote health and safety, distress, or causing offense.\n\n(A) \"Unsafe practices\" may not be associated with advertising content directly, as it is more related to product safety.\n\n(B) \"Distress\" seems applicable in cases where content might cause bodily harm, mental anguish, or fear. However, it's not a characteristic of typical advertising regulations.\n\n(C) No advertising regulation requires advertisers to use safe practices or encourage safe practices. It is more interested in clarity and avoiding ambiguities.\n\nFocusing on typical aspects of regulations, all answers seem to be drifting from the actual context. Hence, the closest answer is (D), which mentions safe practices, distress, jealousy, and serious.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step-by-step explanation:\n\nTo identify the correct answer, we need to understand the concept of employment contracts between workers and employers. An employment contract typically consists of two main components: employee rights and employer duties. Workers have rights, and employers have obligations.\n\n(A) Employee rights refers to the set of rights that employees have, which can vary depending on the specific jurisdiction and the details of each individual contract.\n(B) Employee rights is not the correct answer, because it is a type of rights, not obligations.\n\n(C) Employer duties refers to the obligations of employers towards their workers, often prescribed by law.\n(D) Employee duties describes the obligations imposed upon employees by their contractual agreements, such as attending work on time, performing their job duties, and adhering to company policies.\n\nGiven this understanding, the correct answer is (C) Employer duties.

            "model_answer": "(A) Presenteeism is an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities which, due to intensification of work and technological shifts, has become a hotly contested issue in recent years.\n\nExplanation: Presenteeism refers to the phenomenon where employees come to work but are not fully present or engaged due to personal or professional issues that affect their well-being, leading to decreased productivity. In recent years, intensification of work and technological shifts have made it more challenging for employees to achieve a healthy work-life balance, leading to an increase in presenteeism. Thus, presenteeism can be seen as an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(D) Informational asymmetries, Resources, Co-opted\n\nExplanation:\n\n#### Benefits\n\nBenefits refer to the advantages that a company might gain from a collaboration with a community-based organization (CBO). They could include access to new markets, increased brand visibility, or the ability to contribute to social and environmental causes. While benefits can certainly be a positive aspect of these collaborations, they may not necessarily be equal for both parties.\n\n#### Power imbalance\n\nPower imbalances can arise when one party has more control over the relationship than the other. This might happen when a company has more resources or influence, making the collaboration less than equitable for the CBO. In such cases, the CBO may feel \"hoodwinked\" or exposed to exploitation.\n\n#### Co-opted\n\nCo-opted refers to the situation where a CBO may feel that their mission or values have been compromised due to collaboration with a company. This could happen if the company's goals and values do not align with those of the CBO, if the company takes too much control over the collaboration, or if the collaboration detracts from the CBO's primary mission.\n\nIn summary, power imbalances, where one party has more resources or influence, is the characteristic that creates the most risk for business-CBO collaborations. Informational asymmetries arise when there is a lack of shared information between parties, making the relationship unequal. Co-opted is the term used when the CBO feels that its values or mission have been compromised.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "According to me, the most similar normative theory to corporate profit maximization is (B) preference utilitarianism.\n\nThe reasoning behind this answer is that preference utilitarianism places a strong emphasis on individual preferences and maximizing individual happiness or well-being. In this context, corporate profit maximization can be seen as fulfilling individual preferences by providing consumers with goods and services at the lowest possible cost, which is beneficial to the shareholders and the employees who make a living from the company. The idea of maximizing happiness or well-being of individuals aligns with the principle of profit maximization in this sense.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (B) preference utilitarianism.",

            "model_answer": "Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\nHere are the key concepts related to each of the options:\n\n(A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders: This option suggests that the primary responsibility of a business is to its shareholders, who own the organization and are entitled to the profits. Milton Friedman, an economist and a prominent advocate of free-market capitalism, endorsed this view.\n\n(B) Managers should act in ways that balance the interest of society and shareholders: This option suggests that businesses should consider stakeholders beyond just shareholders, while still prioritizing the interests of their owners. Friedman did not completely reject this view; he argued that businesses should always act in the best interest of their shareholders, but that this interest can be achieved by balancing it with the interests of other stakeholders.\n\n(C) The primary responsibility organizations have is to its employees: This option suggests that the primary responsibility of businesses is to their employees, ensuring their well-being and providing a safe and supportive work environment. Friedman's economic theory focuses primarily on the role of the government and the free market in regulating economic activity, which suggests that he would argue against this view.\n\n(D) The primary responsibility organizations have is to its stakeholders: This option suggests that businesses should have a responsibility to consider the interests of various stakeholders, including employees, the community, and the environment. Friedman's views on corporate social responsibility were controversial, as he believed that businesses should not have a responsibility outside of earning profits for their shareholders, which leads us to...\n\nAnswer: (A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders.",
