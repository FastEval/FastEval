            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime\nThis option is not correct as it directly states that cryptocurrencies are expensive and have a host of associated ethical implications, including financial crime. However, the given text mentions bitcoin, which has been used to engage in financial crime. It does not provide information about expensive or secure.\n\n(B) Traditional currency, Cheap, Unsecure, Charitable giving\nThis option is not correct as it directly states that traditional currencies are cheap but unsecure and have a host of associated ethical implications, including charitable giving. However, the given text does not mention traditional currencies' exact cost.\n\n(C) Cryptocurrencies, Cheap, Secure, Financial crime\nThis option is the best fit among the given choices. The text mentions that cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly mainstream and have a whole host of associated ethical implications, including being secure and more expensive, but the only direct reference to financial crime is the phrase \"engage in.\" While cryptocurrencies also have ethical implications such as financial crime, the text does not explicitly mention their direct involvement in financial crime. Thus, this option is the most accurate interpretation based on the given text.\n\n(D) Traditional currency, Expensive, Unsecure, Charitable giving\nThis option is not correct because it does not accurately describe the text's information about the given topic. The text does mention charitable giving but does not mention traditional currencies being expensive or unsecure.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand what advertising regulatory bodies suggest and what they consider unacceptable in advertisements. Typically, advertising regulatory bodies suggest a set of guidelines that advertisements should adhere to in order to ensure that they are not misleading, offensive, or otherwise harmful.\n\n(A) Encouraging unsafe practices, causing unnecessary fear, or trivializing health or safety issues would generally be considered unacceptable in advertising.\n\n(B) Unsafe practices, causing distress or fear, or promoting something as offensive, could negatively impact the audience and be in violation of advertising regulations.\n\n(C) Adverts promoting safe practices, without causing distress or fear, and being trivial would generally be considered acceptable.\n\n(D) Adverts promoting safe practices and avoiding jealousy, while having serious implications, could still be viewed as unacceptable if they encourage negative behavior or promote anything as offensive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Serious",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is D. Employee duties.\n\nThe term \"employee rights\" is self-explanatory and represents obligations of employers towards their employees. \"Employee rights\" is not a specific obligation, but a comprehensive term encompassing various rights that employees have based on individual contracts and broader employment laws.\n\n\"Employee duties\" on the other hand, represent the obligations of workers towards their employer. These are the expectations and requirements that the employer has for their employees to follow and fulfill. Examples include punctuality, adhering to company policies, meeting project deadlines, etc.\n\nTherefore, when we look at the options provided, D.

            "question": " ______ is an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities which, due to intensification of work and technological shifts, has become a hotly contested issue in recent years.\n\n(A) Presenteeism\n(B) Absenteeism\n(C) Work-play balance\n(D) Work-life balance",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "B - Absenteeism\n\nReasoning: Absenteeism refers to the employee's unauthorized absence from work, which can be motivated by various factors, including work-related or non-work-related activities. This concept is contrasted with presenteeism, which is an employee's preference for engaging in work-related activities during non-work hours. While presenteeism has been a topic of discussion, absenteeism is more commonly used to describe when an employee does not come to work, regardless of whether the absence is related to work or not.\n\nWork-life balance, on the other hand, refers to the idea of achieving a balance between an individual's work and personal life. While it is an important concept, it does not directly pertain to an individual's preferred ratio of work-related to non-work-related activities.\n\nSimilarly, work-play balance refers to the desire for a balance between work and leisure activities, but it does not necessarily involve dividing an individual's time between work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B - Absenteeism.",

It does not directly mention organisms or interdependence, which are key components in ecosystems.\n\n(B) Industrial ecosystems: This option suggests a similar concept of interconnectedness and interdependence between companies, industries, and their environments. However, the term \"ecosystems\" might be misleading as it is often used in biological or environmental contexts, rather than industrial settings.\n\n(C) Ecological ecosystems: This option correctly highlights the interconnection and interdependence of organisms and their environments, which is a defining characteristic of ecological ecosystems. However, it might not directly translate to the context of industries and corporations.\n\n(D) Corporate ecosystems: This option is the closest match to the given description.

This type of power imbalance is a common limitation and risk of business-CSO collaborations. CSOs, which are Community-Based Organizations, can be vulnerable to being \"co-opted\" or having their agendas and goals altered in ways that are not in their best interest. This is because corporations may have more resources and power than CSOs and can use these resources to influence the direction of the collaboration. Additionally, this scenario can result in the CSO being seen as a beneficiary rather than a co-equal partner in the collaboration.",

In this context, corporate profit maximization may be seen as a means to one end of creating overall happiness or satisfaction by providing employment opportunities, goods and services, and other benefits to consumers.\n\nHowever, utilitarianism can be further classified into different types, such as hedonistic utilitarianism (maximizing overall pleasure) and preference utilitarianism (maximizing individual preferences).\n\nTherefore, I will choose (A) hedonistic utilitarianism as the option that is most similar to corporate profit maximization due to its focus on maximizing overall pleasure.\n\nAnswer: (A) hedonistic utilitarianism.",

The phrase \"temporal, spatial and task-related fluidity\" in the context implies that the working practices should have flexibility with respect to time, location, and tasks.\n2. \"Dynamic\" refers to something that is constantly changing or moving. While this is true of fluid working practices in some aspects, it does not specifically involve temporal, spatial, and task-related fluidity.\n3. \"Flexible\" refers to being able to bend or adopt without breaking, but it does not necessarily imply the constant change and adaptability required for fluid working practices.\n4. \"Modern\" does not inherently relate to fluid working practices, as they can be implemented in any setting or time period.\n\nTherefore, the best option is (B) Fluid.",
