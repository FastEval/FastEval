            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each option in turn and determine which option best describes a valid disjunctive syllogism's major premise.\n\n(A) \"includes two or more alternatives\" - This statement is not entirely accurate in the context of a valid disjunctive syllogism. In a disjunctive syllogism, the middle term (the subject) has to be categorized as either \"p\" or \"not p.\" The major premise would only be true if the antecedent was presented as two alternatives. However, it is not about including two alternatives, but rather presenting two exclusive alternatives for the subject.\n\n(B) \"classifies subjects\" - This statement is also not entirely accurate in the context of a valid disjunctive syllogism. Although classifying subjects is necessary in categorical syllogisms, disjunctive syllogisms deal with each category individually, not the subjects collectively.\n\n(C) \"affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent\" - This statement is the most accurate description of a valid major premise in a disjunctive syllogism. The antecedent (the first premise) affirms the subject as \"p\" or \"q,\" while the consequent (the second premise) denies the opposite of the antecedent.\n\nConsidering these statements, the best option is (C). A valid disjunctive syllogism's major premise should affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent.",

It refers to the use of elitism or pretentious language to make something seem more important or valuable than it actually is.\n\n(C) Poisoning the well is a fallacy where an opponent introduces misleading or irrelevant information about a source in order to discredit it or eliminate it from consideration. It involves an attack on a source before any evidence has been presented, making it difficult for an argument to be evaluated fairly.\n\n(D) Appeal to anonymous authority is a fallacy where evidence or an argument is presented as credible based solely on the source's anonymity. It ignores the fact that anonymity does not necessarily imply experience or credibility, and it discourages people from being accountable for their claims.\n\nBased on the given options, C is the correct answer.",
