            "model_answer": "The principle that is not an element of the responsibility to protect is (C) The responsibility to remain sovereign.\n\n(C) The responsibility to remain sovereign means the duty of a state to prioritize its own domestic affairs and political interests over the protection of its citizens, and that a state must maintain its sovereignty, whatever the cost. This principle is not an element of the responsibility to protect, which aims to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, and to prevent the event, provide protection, and promote post-conflict recovery and institution building without violating the sovereignty of the state. The responsibility to protect means that the international community has a responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, and that the state has a primary responsibility to protect its own population from such atrocities, but if it is unable or unwilling to do so, then the international community must step in to take appropriate action. It includes three core obligations: to prevent, protect, and rebuild. In contrast, the responsibility to remain sovereign is not an element of the responsibility to protect, which stresses the importance of protecting populations from atrocities and promoting post-conflict recovery and institution building without violating the sovereignty of the state.",

So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n\nExplanation:\n(B) states that environmental changes can undermine national security in various ways, one of which is by eroding the natural capital base of an economy. This can lead to a reduction in the military capacity of the country since the economic base that determines military capacity is weakened. Additionally, any developments brought about by environmental changes will be human-driven, and may not necessarily improve the military programs.\n\n(A) states that environmental challenges, such as natural resource management and employment, can lead to diversification and research that may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs. This option suggests that environmental challenges can have a positive impact on national security by driving technological advancements that can improve military capabilities.\n\n(C) states that the environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal, and external threats remain within a country's control. This option suggests that environmental challenges do not pose a significant threat to national security, as they are primarily internal in nature, and military threats can be addressed within a country's control.\n\n(D) states that all of the above options are true, meaning that environmental changes can both undermine and improve national security, depending on the specific circumstances, and that environmental challenges are both internal and external, and can affect military capabilities and technological advancements.\n\nThe answer is (B)",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "model_answer": "Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\n\nFor a statement to be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security, it should reflect the principles of liberalism, which emphasize individual rights, private property, and limited government intervention.\n\nOption B best reflects the liberal perspective on future energy security. It suggests that energy scarcity will lead to a \"new international energy order,\" characterized by statism and neo-mercantilism, which are not inherently liberal principles. However, this idea suggests that a change in the energy market's conditions could lead to a shift in the power dynamics between states, and that could be seen as a liberal perspective if it acknowledges the potential for change.\n\nOption A does not align with liberalism, as it suggests that the interests of all core powers are the same and that the current economic order, which is based on capitalist economic elites, is just and equal.\n\nOption C, while suggesting that oil is the lifeblood of the current order, does not necessarily align with liberalism, as it rests upon an unequal distribution of wealth and power.\n\nTherefore, the statement in option B is the most liberal perspective of the future energy security.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Organized crime has also been viewed as separate from transnational crime. International approaches for information sharing have been limited to bilateral agreements in order to apprehend criminals who are actively evading justice, with no significant institutionalized approach.\n(B) The increasing expansion of TNC in the 1990s led states to focus on reducing the asymmetries between countries through measures such as harmonizing laws and increasing police capacity and networking. The response to transnational crime has focused on targeting criminals and the criminal markets themselves, rather than a global approach.\n(C) The US war on drugs had a significant impact on government responses to TNC and has emphasized bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement. The approach involves using sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing responses to organized crime, as well as the militarization of law enforcement to address the terrorism-organized crime nexus during the Global War on Terror, has resulted in a shift towards an international institutionalist approach instead of a global one.",

This suggests that policy-makers and academics from different disciplines came together to discuss security-related issues, which could lead to a diverse range of perspectives being taken into account in the policy-making process.\n\n(B) Policy-academe developments have resulted in the modification of the role of think tanks away from policy towards politicization resistant theory.\n\nThis statement suggests that the institutionalization of academe-policy interaction in the field of security studies has led to a change in the role of think tanks. Think tanks are typically seen as policy-oriented organizations, but this statement suggests that they have shifted towards producing politicization resistant theory. This could indicate that the relationship between academia and policy is becoming more nuanced, with academics producing research that is more insulated from politics, rather than being solely focused on providing policy recommendations.\n\n(C) Security studies has been marked by the gradual \"IR-ification\" of the discipline.

The institutional blurring between universities, think tank, and policy has resulted in policy mergers at every level.\n\nThis statement suggests that the institutionalization of academe-policy interaction in the field of security studies has led to a greater blurring of the boundaries between academia, think tanks, and policy-making. This could indicate that there is greater collaboration between these three entities, with policy being produced through a more open and collaborative process.

The Washington Consensus refers to a set of policy recommendations that were proposed by the Washington-based Institutions such as the IMF, World Bank, and the US Treasury in the 1980s and 1990s. These recommendations were mainly aimed at promoting economic growth through liberalization of trade and investment policies, deregulation, and privatization. Fiscal discipline, on the other hand, is a general economic principle that emphasizes the importance of maintaining a sustainable public finance that ensures government spending does not exceed its income.\n\n(B) Tax Reform: This is not one of the 10 steps of the Washington Consensus. The Washington Consensus did not have a specific recommendation for tax reform, but tax reform is generally seen as an important policy area in promoting economic growth by encouraging investment and savings.\n\n(C) Property Rights: This is not one of the 10 steps of the Washington Consensus as the Washington Consensus mainly focused on liberalizing trade and investment policies, promoting privatization and deregulation rather than property rights.\n\n(D) Nationalization: This is one of the 10 steps of the Washington Consensus. The Washington Consensus recommended state enterprises should be protected.
