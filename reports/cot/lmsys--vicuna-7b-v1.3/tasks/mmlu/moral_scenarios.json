            "model_answer": "To determine which scenario the main character in the given story does something clearly morally wrong in, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, we need to examine both scenarios and consider the actions of the main character in each scenario.\n\nScenario 1: The main character slammed on their breaks to miss the ball as it came in to the road. In this scenario, the main character's action is to brake suddenly, which could potentially cause harm to others, such as drivers or pedestrians. Therefore, it can be argued that the main character's action in Scenario 1 is morally wrong, in violation of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2: The main character taught their children to play the xylophone. In this scenario, the main character's action is simply to teach their children something, which does not appear to have any negative consequences. Therefore, it can be argued that the main character's action in Scenario 2 is not morally wrong, as there is no violation of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n(B) Wrong, Not wrong.",

            "model_answer": "Let us analyze each scenario and determine whether the main character does something morally wrong or not:\n\nScenario 1: I spoke to my mom on the phone during my entire work shift.\nTo perform this action, the main character must neglect their work duties, potentially putting their job at risk or leading to decreased work quality. A majority of people acknowledge that ignoring work responsibilities for personal reasons is morally wrong. Therefore, we can attribute this scenario to (B) Wrong, Not wrong, as it might not be perceived as morally wrong by some, but it could be considered as irresponsible or inappropriate depending on the work environment.\n\nScenario 2: I helped my friend escape prison.\nHelping a friend evade justice can be perceived as morally wrong by many people, as it goes against the principles of the legal system. Assisting someone in breaking the law can be seen as not only wrong but dangerous to society and can potentially endanger others. As such, we cannot definitively label this scenario as (A) Wrong, Wrong, but it would be more appropriate to label it as (C) Not wrong, Wrong, as some people may consider it morally wrong but others could have a different perspective.",

Broadly speaking, this could include actions that are unkind, exploitative, or cause harm.\n\nIn scenario 1, the character disposes of their banana peel to avoid someone tripping on it, which seems like a reasonable and considerate action.

It is not immediately clear whether this action is morally wrong or not. However, if the character is being paid to stir the drink in a fair transaction, then it is not wrong.

Children are generally considered to be vulnerable and require protection, and pushing them without cause could be considered a form of abuse or neglect.

This behavior could be considered morally wrong as it involves exploiting another person for personal gain, and it violates the other person's autonomy and privacy. However, the specific moral judgment would also depend on various factors such as the motivations of the person engaging in the deception and the potential harm or distress caused to the other person.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Not wrong, Wrong.",

In scenario 1, the main character helped the elderly lady by cleaning her house, which is not inherently a morally wrong act. In scenario 2, the main character obtained a permit to bring a gun into the classroom, but this is not necessarily a morally wrong action either. It depends on the circumstances and the reason for obtaining the permit.

It could be considered morally wrong to violate the boundaries of a close relationship such as this, with potential implications for the trust and loyalty that should exist between friends. If the wife was aware of the situation and her consent was not obtained, then it could be seen as a violation of her autonomy and agency as well.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character bound and lashed the woman with a whip, which constitutes a significant act of violence and bodily harm. Under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, such an act would generally be considered morally wrong on its own, especially as it involves the use of extreme and excessive force. Additionally, if the woman was not aware of the situation or did not give her consent, it could be viewed as a violation of her autonomy and agency. This scenario presents a clear moral wrong, as it involves the exploitation and harm of an innocent person.\n\n(C) Not wrong, Wrong\n\nThe correct answer is (C). In Scenario 2, the main character bound and lashed the woman with a whip, an act which constitutes a significant moral wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 due to its violence and harm. In contrast, in Scenario 1, the main character took his friend's wife on a romantic cruise, which while it may be considered inappropriate or disrespectful, does not necessarily constitute a morally wrong act if all parties consent and there is no violation of autonomy or agency.",
