            "question": "One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\n(B) admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\n(C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n(D) inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",

            "question": "A state statute provides: \"Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. \" Violation of the statute is made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found\n\n(A) not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(B) not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(C) guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n(D) guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.",

            "model_answer": "To determine whether the suspect should be found guilty or not guilty, we need to examine the circumstances surrounding the arrest, the use of force by the suspect and the police officer, and whether the arrest was lawful or unlawful.\n\nAccording to the state statue, a person has a duty to refrain from using force in resisting arrest. If the suspect knew or should have known that he was being arrested by a police officer, he violated this duty by hitting the police officer with his fist. Therefore, the answer is (B) not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\n\nHowever, the police officer's account suggests that the suspect didn't just resist arrest, but also hit the police officer and then assaulted him. The jury's belief in either account doesn't necessarily determine whether the arrest was lawful or not. The arrest could be considered unlawful without probable cause, and in that case, the suspect could be found guilty.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is (C) guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.",

            "question": "A taxpayer was notified by the government that her individual income tax was underpaid by $1,012. 69. The taxpayer retained an attorney to represent her in contesting the assessment. During the preparation of his client's case, the attorney suggested that it might be a good idea if the taxpayer hired an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement for the year in question. Following the attorney's advice, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, who prepared a financial statement, which the attorney referred to at trial. During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testif' about statements that the taxpayer made to him. The accountant's proposed testimony is\n\n(A) inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n(B) inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.\n(C) inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.\n(D) admissible as an admission.",

If the accountant's testimony were to be inadmissible under any of the four options listed, it would prevent the attorney from referencing the accountant's prepared financial statement during the trial.\n3. The accountant's testimony would not be inadmissible due to the attorney-client privilege because the accountant is not a party to the legal proceedings. Privilege applies to communications between parties and their attorneys, not between non-parties.\n4. The accountant's testimony would not be inadmissible due to the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination because the financial statement is not testimony in the sense that the taxpayer is not incriminating herself through its production.\n5. The accountant's testimony would not be inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule because the accountant's testimony would not reveal any protected work product.\n\nTherefore, the single letter answer to this question is (D) admissible as an admission.",

            "question": "A resident announced his candidacy for state representative. A law in the state requires new political entrants (regardless of party affiliation) to obtain three times the number of signatures as other candidates who have run for office previously. The resident, however, failed to obtain the necessary number of authenticating signatures to have his name placed on the ballot. The resident filed a complaint in federal district court alleging the unconstitutionality of the authenticating requirement. Which of the following, if established, is the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticating requirement?\n\n(A) The resident's petition contained a large number of false signatures.\n(B) A similar authenticating statute was held to be constitutional in another state the previous year.\n(C) The authenticating requirement was necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n(D) Two other candidates had successfully petitioned to have their names included on the ballot.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To establish the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticating requirement, we need to consider the requirements of the First Amendment's Petition Clause, which protects the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. The Petition Clause states that \"[t]he right of the people . . . to petition the Government for a redress of grievances shall not be infringed.\" U.S. Const. amend. I.\n\n(A) The resident's petition contained a large number of false signatures. This argument does not relate to the Petition Clause or the constitutionality of the authenticating requirement.\n\n(B) A similar authenticating statute was held to be constitutional in another state the previous year. This argument does not directly address the Petition Clause or the validity of the authenticating requirement. It is possible that a court might find a similar statute constitutional, but this fact alone does not constitute the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticating requirement.\n\n(C) The authenticating requirement was necessary to further a compelling state interest. This is a possible argument for upholding the authenticating requirement under the strict scrutiny standard applied to regulations that restrict speech or petitioning activity. If the state can show that the authenticating requirement is necessary to serve a compelling interest and that it is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest, it may be able to sustain the requirement.\n\n(D) Two other candidates had successfully petitioned to have their names included on the ballot. This argument might support the argument that the authenticating requirement is not too burdensome, since candidates have successfully obtained the necessary signatures in the past.

            "question": "A defendant was angry at his friend for marrying the defendant's former girlfriend. As the friend was painting his house one afternoon, the defendant fired a shot from his gun at him. Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter. The defendant is subsequently charged with the first-degree murder of the daughter. The relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are as follows:Section 169: Murder in the first degree is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170: Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. Which of the following, if established, would provide the defendant with his best defense?\n\n(A) He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.\n(B) He intended only to wound the friend.\n(C) He was unaware of the elements of malice.\n(D) The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.",

Malice aforethought is defined as having a deliberate intention to take another person's life. In this case, the defendant's act of firing a shot at his friend and killing the friend's daughter meets this element of malice aforethought.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not provide the defendant with a valid defense.\n\nOption A states that the defendant intended to kill the friend and not the daughter, but it does not necessarily mean that the defendant did not have malice aforethought.\n\nOption B states that the defendant intended only to wound the friend, which is not enough to prove malice aforethought.\n\nOption D states that the killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend, but negligence is not a valid defense for first-degree murder.\n\nTherefore, option C, which states that the defendant was unaware of the elements of malice, would be the best defense. If the defendant can prove that he did not have a deliberate intention to take another person's life, then he cannot be found guilty of first-degree murder.",

            "question": "A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order\n\n(A) valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\n(B) valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\n(C) invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\n(D) invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.",

Warrantless searches are generally considered unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and are thus subject to strict scrutiny. There are, however, exceptions to the warrant requirement that allow law enforcement to conduct searches without a warrant under certain circumstances.\n\nThe four options provided in the question are commonly known warrantless search exceptions:\n\n(A) Cold pursuit: Permits law enforcement to pursue a fleeing suspect without a warrant, as long as it is in hot pursuit and has probable cause to believe that the suspect has committed a crime.\n\n(B) Incident to a lawful arrest: Allows law enforcement to search the person arrested and the area within their immediate control without a warrant, as long as the arrest is lawful and the search is related to the arrest.\n\n(C) Plain view: Permits law enforcement to seize evidence that is in plain view during the course of a lawful investigation, without a warrant.\n\n(D) Stop and frisk: Allows law enforcement to stop and question a person, and if necessary, frisk them for weapons, without a warrant, as long as the stop is based on specific and articulable facts that justify suspicion of criminal activity.\n\nTherefore, to determine which of these is not a warrantless search exception, we need to identify an additional option that does not satisfy the criteria.\n\nOption (E) would be: Search incident to a lawful search. This option does not satisfy the criteria of the other exceptions, as it is a general search exception rather than a specific situation where a warrantless search is allowed.\n\nHowever, this is not provided in the question.

The man and his purported second wife bought a home together as tenants by the entirety. They lived there together for a few years, when the man was accused and convicted of killing his purported wife. He was given a life sentence.

The trial court awarded the property to the estate. The man appealed from his prison cell. Under the common law, will the appellate court affirm the trial court's decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home?\n\n(A) Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\n(B) Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\n(C) No, the court will as a policy matter recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common.\n(D) No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.",

In this case, the man was already separated from his first wife but never divorced. By marrying his second wife and living with her as husband and wife, he was committing bigamy. As a result, he could not take good title to the property because he lacked the necessary legal right to marry his second wife.
