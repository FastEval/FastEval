However, its emission spectral range is not well-defined, making it less suitable for spectroscopy.\n2.

We need to identify the principle or factor that causes the difference in energy between the para- and ortho- states.\n\n(A) Heisenberg uncertainty principle: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the position and momentum of a particle and predicts that, for a given quantum system, there is a lower limit to the uncertainty of its position, which is given by  uncertainly in the position operator (\u210f/2\u03c0), and an upper limit to the uncertainty of its momentum, which is given by uncertainly in the momentum operator (\u210f/2\u03c0). The difference in energy can be understood as a product of the reduced mass (m/2) of the helium-4 atom and the second derivative of the energy with respect to the internuclear distance (a) due to the repulsive Coulomb force. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle implies that the energy difference between the para- and ortho- states is related to the internuclear distance (a) and the electronic momenta. For a given internuclear distance (a), the Heisenberg uncertainty principle leads to lower energy for the ortho- state than for the para- state, as the electronic momenta in the para- and ortho- states must have a certain relation to fulfill the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nTherefore, our reasoning leads us to option (A): the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\nThe final answer:\n\n(A)",

We can model this with an equation that involves the voltage across the first capacitor (V1) and the voltage across the second capacitor (V2) after they have been connected in series.\n\nWe can start by finding the total capacitance C\\_total of the three capacitors (C1, C2, C3). Since they are identical capacitors, the total capacitance C\\_total = C1 = C2 = C3.\n\nNext, we need to find the voltage across each of the capacitors when they are connected in series. The sum of the voltages across the first two capacitors (V1 and V2) is equal to the voltage across the third capacitor (V3):\n\nV1 + V2 = V3\n\nWe know that the potential difference across each capacitor (V) is equal to the voltage across the capacitor divided by its capacitance (V = C / Q):\n\nV1 = C1 / Q1\nV2 = C2 / Q2\nV3 = C3 / Q3\n\nNow that we have the relationship between V, V1, V2, and V3, we can substitute one of these expressions into V1 + V2 = V3:\n\n(C1 / Q1) + (C2 / Q2) = C3 / Q3\n\nC1 / Q1 + C2 / Q2 = C3 / Q3\n\nSubtracting V2 from both sides gives:\n\n(V1 - V2) = (C1 / Q1) - (C2 / Q2)\n\nSince V1 + V2 = V3, and we know that V1 + V2 = C3 / Q3 (from above), we can substitute V3 for the sum V1 + V2:\n\n(V1 - V2) = (C2 / Q2) (V3 - V2) / (Q1 + Q2 - Q3)\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the capacitance of the two uncharged capacitors (C2 and C3) to the capacitance of the first charged capacitor (C1). Since C1 > C2 > C3, the ratio is C2 / C1. Substitute this ratio into the equation above:\n\n(V1 - V2) = (C2 / C1) ((V3 - V2) / (Q1 + Q2 - Q3))\n\nNow we can find V1 - V2 in terms of Q1, Q2, and Q3:\n\nV1 - V2 = C2 / C1 (V3 - V2) / (Q1 + Q2 - Q3)\n\nSince V1 and V2 are the voltages across the first two capacitors when they are connected in series, we can find V1 by combining the equations we have already derived:\n\nV1 = (C1 / Q1) + (C2 / Q2) = (C1 + C2C2 / Q2) / Q1'\n\nDividing both sides by Q1 and substituting the right-hand side into V1 - V2, we get:\n\n(C1 + C2C2 / Q2) / Q1 - (C2 / C1) (V3 - V2) / (Q1 + Q2 - Q3) = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by Q1, we get:\n\nC1 + C2C2 / Q2 = C2C2 / Q1\n\nNow we need to use the fact that Q1 + Q2 + Q3 = Q to solve for Q1 in terms of Q2 and Q3. Substitute this into the equation above:\n\nC1 / Q1 = C2 / Q2 = C3 / Q3\n\nC1 / Q1 = 2(C2 / Q2) = 2(C3 / Q3)\n\nNow we can solve for Q1 in terms of Q2 and Q3:\n\nQ1 = C1 / C2Q2 / Q3\n\nFinally, we can find the expression for V1:\n\nV1 = (C1 + C2C",
