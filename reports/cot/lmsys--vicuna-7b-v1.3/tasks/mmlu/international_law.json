            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe question compares and contrasts Responsibility to Protect (R2P) with humanitarian intervention. R2P is a principle that emerged from the 2005 World Summit Outcome, which offered a new framework for responding to genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, refers to situations where one state or organization intervenes in another state's affairs to protect civilians from harm or to provide assistance during an ongoing conflict.\n\nOut of the options provided, option (D) is the correct one. R2P is a responsibility for states to protect their own populations from genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and it can involve the use of armed force, especially when the state in question is unable or unwilling to do so. Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, is typically conducted by states or organizations without prior authorization from the international community, and it is aimed at protecting civilians and preventing humanitarian crises, without necessarily involving armed force.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that option (D) is the correct answer - R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not. The answer is D.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The 'Lotus principle' refers to the principle of customary international law that states the freedom of States to choose their own forum for resolving disputes. This principle is commonly referred to as the \"Lotus principle\" because it was established in the 1927 Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) case of the SS Lotus v. United Kingdom.\n\nThe relevant passage from the Lotus case states, \"what is not prohibited by international law is legal.\" This passage has been interpreted to mean that anything that is not clearly prohibited in international law is legal. In the context of the principle of freedom of choice of forum, this means that States are free to choose the forum in which they wish to resolve disputes.\n\nTherefore, the 'Lotus principle' is (B) the so-called Lotus principle is that States are free to choose the Court that they will submit their disputes.",

These options represent different perspectives on what the UK Constitution is and how it functions. First, option (A) suggests that the UK Constitution's only source of power is that of the sovereign, a view consistent with traditional constitutional theory. Second, option (B) holds that the judiciary has the power to overturn acts of parliament, a more modern perspective that emphasizes the role of the constitution in limiting parliamentary lawmaking. Third, option (C) claims that the UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources, which correlates with the UK Constitution not being written down in any single document. Fourth, option (D) argues that the UK Constitution is based on a Bill of Rights, which is essential for how the UK Constitution grants rights to its citizens and sets limits on the power of the sovereign.",

This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes\n(C) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute\n(D) It is an obligation which concerns solely international courts and tribunals",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Answer: C) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute.\n\nExplanation: A peremptory norm, also known as a jus cogens rule, is a rule of international law that is accepted by the international community as a whole and is imperative or \u201ccompelling\u201d in character. Such norms are considered binding on all states, regardless of whether they have explicitly accepted them into their legal systems. One example of a peremptory norm is the obligation to settle disputes peacefully.\n\nThis is supported by the fact that the peaceful settlement of disputes is a fundamental principle of international law, which has been recognized and reaffirmed by numerous international instruments, such as the United Nations Charter and the International Court of Justice Statute. Additionally, this principle is considered so essential that it is codified in Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, which requires states to refrain from threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. This reflects a peremptory norm that the peaceful settlement of disputes is a moral duty of states.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the obligation to peacefully settle disputes is a peremptory norm of international law, which means that all states have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is false, we need to examine each of the four statements individually and compare them.\n\nFirst, we look at statement A. It states that Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three judge formation to a one judge formation. We need to verify if this is true or false.\n\nAfter investigating this statement, we find that it is true. Protocol 14 did indeed change the committee that hears admissibility cases to a one judge formation.\n\nNext, we look at statement B. It states that Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility. We need to verify if this is true or false.\n\nAfter investigating this statement, we find that it is true. Protocol 14 did add a new criterion for admissibility, known as the \"margin of appreciation\" test, which allows states some flexibility in how they apply human rights standards.\n\nNext, we look at statement C. It states that Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights. We need to verify if this is true or false.\n\nAfter investigating this statement, we find that it is false. The Commission of Human Rights was not abolished by Protocol 14. In fact, the Commission continues to operate as an important part of the European human rights system.\n\nFinally, we look at statement D. It states that Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights. We need to verify if this is true or false.\n\nAfter investigating this statement, we find that it is false. Protocol 14 did not extend the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights. In fact, the term of office for judges on the Court is set by the European Treaties and has not changed under Protocol 14.\n\nBased on our investigation of each statement, we can conclude that statement D is false.

If they cannot sustain human habitation or economic life, then they are considered as \"rocks\" and do not have any maritime zones or exclusive economic zones.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect, as islands can have different sizes and still be considered \"islands\".\n\nOption (B) is incorrect, as rocks are considered as \"islands\" and thus they do have maritime zones, but they do not have exclusive economic zones or continental shelf rights.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect, as the criterion for a rock to be a \"rock\" is not based on the size, but on the ability to sustain human habitation or economic life of its own.",
