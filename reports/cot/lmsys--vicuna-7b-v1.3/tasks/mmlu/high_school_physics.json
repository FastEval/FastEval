We can find the capacitance by dividing the potential difference (5 V) by the potential difference (1 V/mF) per unit of capacitance. The potential difference per unit of capacitance is 1/C, so we can write:\n\n5 V / (1 V/mF) = 5 mF / C\n\nSince there is a single capacitor with a charge of 5 V and a capacitance of 2 mF, the charge on each plate is equal. According to the formula for charge on a capacitor plate, Q = (1 / C) \\* V \\* b, where b is the number of electrons per unit charge. Since C is already in Farads and since we have a single plate capacitor, we have no charge in b. Therefore, the charge on the positive plate of the capacitor is zero.\n\nAnswer: (A) 0.005 C.",

We will consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The charge distribution on the surface of the object is not uniform.\nIn this case, the electric field outside the object will not be equal to the electric field inside the object.

This is because an increase in tension stretches the string, which increases its ability to transmit the wave. As the wave travels along the string, it experiences less resistance, which results in a higher wave speed.\n\nOn the other hand, the wavelength of the standing waves is given by 2L, where L is the length of the string. When the tension in the string is increased, the wave speed increases, which means that the wave is traveling faster. As the wave travels faster, it covers more distance in the same amount of time, which results in a shorter wavelength.\n\nTherefore, the wavelength of the new standing waves will be less than the wavelength of the original standing waves.

This equation represents the conservation of mechanical energy, where the sum of the potential and kinetic energies is constant. Since the object is released at the top of the incline, the gravitational potential energy is equal to the kinetic energy at the top, i.e., E = mgh.\n\nSince the object slides without rotating, its vertical velocity at the bottom (\u043b) is simply the negative of its vertical displacement (\u2081) at the bottom:\n\n\u043b = -\u2081\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nmgh -  \u0438\u043c(\u043b) = mg(\u2081) - \u1e7d\u00b2(\u2081)\n\nSimplifying and replacing \u1e7d(\u2081) with \u1e7d\u2080, we get:\n\n(980 J) - (672 J) = mg(1.27 m) - \u1e7d\u2080\u00b2(1.27 m)\n\n0.3 J = mg(1.27 m) + \u1e7d\u2080\u00b2(1.27 m)\n\n0.3 J = 38.36 J\n\n\u1e7d\u2080 = 1.23 m/s\n\nNow we can find the velocity of the object at the bottom by dividing its distance by the time taken:\n\n\u1e7d\u2080 = 1.27 m/s\n\n\u0142 = -\u2081\n\n\u043b = -1.27 m/s\n\nNow we can use the work-energy principle to find the kinetic energy of the object at the bottom.

We can do this by dividing the potential difference by the capacitance of the capacitor. Since the capacitor has a capacitance of 10 \u00b5F, the charging current would be 100 V / 10 \u00b5F = 0.01 A.\n\nNext, we need to find the charge on the capacitor after it has been charged to the potential difference. The charge on a capacitor is proportional to the current flowing through it, and inversely proportional to the capacitance. Therefore, the charge on the capacitor depends on the time it takes to charge the capacitor.\n\nTo find the charge on the capacitor, we can use the formula Q = \u0394U / R, where Q is the charge on the capacitor, \u0394U is the charge difference over time, and R is the capacitance.
