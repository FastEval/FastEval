            "model_answer": "To find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, we need to compute the number of elements (root extensions) of the extension field. The degree of a field extension is defined as the transcendence degree of the field extension, which is the number of transcendental elements (i.e., elements that are not algebraic over the base field) in the extension.\n\nThere are three elements in the given field extension: sqrt(2), sqrt(3), and sqrt(18). Two of these, sqrt(2) and sqrt(3), are rational (i.e., their square is a perfect square), so they are algebraic over Q. The third element, sqrt(18), is irrational, so it is transcendental over Q.\n\nTo see why, note that if p is a prime number that divides the square of an irrational number, then p is necessarily a Mersenne prime (i.e., of the form 2^p - 1). This is because if q is a prime that divides the square of an irrational number (let's say x), then the\u0642 q eight powers of q divide the square of x. However, if p is a Mersenne prime, then the only way that this can be true is if q = 2 (since p = 2^p - 1). But since every prime greater than 3 is (except 2 and 3), we conclude that every prime that divides the square of an irrational number must be a Mersenne prime.\n\nSince sqrt(18) is irrational, it cannot be written as the square of a rational number, so it is transcendental over Q.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the given field extension is A) 0, since there are no transcendental elements and all elements are algebraic over Q.",

            "model_answer": "Answer: D) 0,4\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to determine the coeffients of the polynomial in Z\\_5 (the finite field with 5 elements and addition modulo 5 as the operation).\n2. The polynomial is given as x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x.\n3. We can write the polynomial in the form: P(x) = 11x^2 + (2 - 4/5), where 1 \u2264 x < 4/5.\n4. Root solver: We can use the following steps for finding the roots of the polynomial:\na. 5 is a factor of both the numerator and the denominator of our polynomial, so we can calculate the roots of the quadratic equation obtained from the polynomial's coefficients and the original factor of 5: x = -5 \u00b1 sqrt(5) \\* 2/5.\nb. Now, we can map each of the roots back to the original coefficients (in Z\\_5) of the polynomial P(x): x = 0, 1, 2, 3/5.\n5. We observe that 1, 2, and 3/5 are the elements 0, 1, and 2 respectively in Z\\_5. So, the values X1 = 0, X2 = 1, and X3 = 2 in Z\\_5 corresponds to the polynomial's coefficients.\n6. Now, we can find the remainders of each of these elements in the polynomial. For example, 0^5 + 3(0)^3 + 0(0)^2 + 2(0) = (0)^5, which is 5^3 modulo 5 = 4.\n7. Thus, we need to find the x values from the 5^3 = 4 cube root of 4 = 2, 3, and 5. Each of these values 2, 3, and 5 corresponds to a value of 0, 1, and 4 in Z\\_5 respectively.\n8.

Statement 1: A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.\n\nExplanation: A factor group of a non-Abelian group is a subgroup of the group's factor group, which is formed by factoring the group under the action of some subgroup. Since a non-Abelian group has non-Abelian factors (i.e., subgroups that can't be expressed as a direct product of other subgroups), the factor group will also be non-Abelian. Therefore, A) True, True can be considered as true.\n\n1. Statement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nExplanation: The statement is asking about the properties of normal subgroups. If a subgroup K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, it implies that the entire H group is closed under the conjugation action of G. Therefore, if G acts on K as subgroup, and H is also acting, then G's action will preserve the normality of K within H. Hence, if K is a normal subgroup of H, then it is also a normal subgroup of G, as seen in the group G.

            "model_answer": "Alright, let's start by analyzing each statement separately.\n\nStatement 1:\nSuppose a group has an element of order 15 (g). According to Cauchy's theorem, the order of an element must be a divisor of the order of the group. Thus, the order of the group must be a prime number or contain 15 as a factor.\n\nIf the order of the group is a prime number (p), statements like (A) and (D) could be true:\n\n* If p = 15, the group has exactly 15 elements of order 15, which satisfies statement (A).\n* If p > 15, the group has at least 15 elements of order 15, but not more than 16, which satisfies statement (D).\n\nIf the order of the group contains 15 as a factor, statements like (B) and (D) could be true:\n\n* If the order of the group is a prime number that is a multiple of 15, like 15, 30, 45, or 90, then the group has more than 8 elements of order 15, and there are always exactly 16 elements of order 15 in such groups (15 elements have order 15, and the 16th element has order 0).\n* If the order of the group is a divisor of 15, like 15 itself (if p=15, document)(p=30 if gcd(p,p)={1,30}), then the group has more than 8 elements of order 15 and at least 16 elements of order 15. This satisfies both statement (D) and (B) because there are always 15 elements of order 15 and at least one more (16-15=1) element of order 15.\n\nNow, about statement 2:\n\nStatement 2 states that if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15. This can be considered true, but not directly from the statement itself. For a group to have more than 16 elements of order 15, the group would have to have elements of order greater than 15, which would mean that some elements would have order 1 instead of 0. If a group has more than 6 non-identity elements (p > 6), it always has at least one element (called the VIIIth element) with an order greater than 6. However, doing so would also make the group abelian. Thus, in non-abelian groups, it's unlikely to find more than 6 elements with orders 1 through 15, and having more than 16 elements of order 15 would require extra elements with non-unique orders, which might be rare.\n\nConsidering the above reasoning, it seems that the statement 2 is true, but not as directly stated in the statement.
