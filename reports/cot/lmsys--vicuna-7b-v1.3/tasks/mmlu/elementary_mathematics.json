            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the value of p in the equation 24 = 2p. We can start by isolating p on one side of the equation and the remaining numbers on the other side.\n\nFirst, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the 2 in the equation:\n```scss\n24 = 2p * 2\n48 = 2p\n```\nNow, we can simplify the right side by combining the p and 8 to get 2p = 48:\n```css\n2p = 48\np = 24\n```\nTherefore, the value of p is 24.
