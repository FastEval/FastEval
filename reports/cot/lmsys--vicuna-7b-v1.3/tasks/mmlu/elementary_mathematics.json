            "model_answer": "To find out how many miles Ms. Perez drove each day, we need to know the distance she traveled in one day. We are given that she drove a total of 40 miles in 5 days, and we are asked to find out how many miles she drove each day.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s work backward. We know she drove a total of 40 miles in 5 days, and each day has at most 24 hours. This means she drove less than 40 miles per day. To find out how many miles she drove each day, we need to know how many hours she drove.\n\nThere are 5 days, and each day is 24 hours long. This means there are 5 \\* 24 = <<5*24=120>>120 hours in 5 days. If she drove less than 40 miles per day, how many miles can she have traveled in 120 hours?\n\nShe drove 40 miles in 5 days, so the amount of miles she can have traveled in 120 hours is:\n\n40 miles / 120 hours = <<40/120=0.3333>0.3333 miles/hour>0.3333 miles/hour\n\nSince she drove the same number of miles each day, we should have the same distance per hour per day. This means she drove:\n\n40 miles / 5 days = <<40/5=8>>8 miles/day\n\nNow we can find out how many miles she drove each day by dividing her total distance by the number of days:\n\n(40 miles / 5 days) \\* 8 miles/day = <<(40/5)*8=6.67>>6.67 miles/day\n\nSo Ms. Perez drove approximately 6.67 miles per day. Answer: (D) 9. The precise number of miles she drove is 6.67 miles, and we don\u2019t have the exact number of minutes, so we can\u2019t round that number to 7 miles.",
