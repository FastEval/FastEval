            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand the characteristics of naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes.\n\n1. Naturalists who focused on natural elements and processes: This idea originated from Greek philosopher Epicurus, who believed that the primary goal of humans should be to live simply and tranquilly without excessive desires. Later, this idea was elaborated upon by philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who argued that humans have a natural inclination to be self-sufficient and to live in harmony with nature.\n2. The natural, living environment: This perspective focuses on the natural environment and emphasizes the importance of ecological balance. It emphasizes interconnectedness and the inherent connections between living beings and their environment.\n3. Naturalism: This philosophical perspective argues that naturalism is the only source of knowledge and philosophy.\n\nNow that we have established the key ideas, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Daoism: Daoism focuses on the harmony between natural elements and the importance of living in balance with them. However, it also has aspects related to a mathematical, deterministic, and transcendental physics (like that of the Celestial Pine needles) that do not align with this particular naturalistic perspective.\n\n(B) Yin-Yang School: The Yin-Yang School does not focus on natural elements and processes. Rather, it is primarily concerned with the balance between opposing forces within the natural world.\n\n(C) Mengzi: Mengzi is a Chinese philosopher who emphasized the importance of living in harmony with nature. However, his ideas do not directly relate to a naturalistic perspective on natural elements and processes.\n\n(D) Humanistic Buddhism: Humanistic Buddhism also focuses on human well-being, but it does not inherently emphasize natural elements and processes.\n\nAfter analyzing the options, it seems that naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes are most closely associated with humanistic Buddhism.\n\nAnswer: D",

After the introduction of Buddhism to Japan in the 6th century, it gradually gained popularity and was adopted as the state religion under the reign of Empress Wu Zetian in the year 654.\n2. The construction of Buddhist temples in Japan began during the Asuka period (538-710), which was before the introduction of Buddhism. Initially, these temples were built by merchants and nobles as libraries and centers for conducting therecension of scriptures.\n3. The first Buddhist temple constructed in Japan was most likely built after the introduction of Buddhism in 654, but we cannot be sure about the exact year this occurred. Therefore, the answer cannot be determine.\n\nAnswer: (A) 325 CE\n\nExplanation: It is generally accepted that Buddhism was introduced to Japan in the 6th century, but the exact year is not specified.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(D) Guru is the answer.\n\nTo arrive at this answer, let's consider the historical context of Guru Nanak and the Sikh religion. Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, lived in the 15th and 16th centuries in the Punjab region of India. His teachings were based on the concept of One God (Wahaguru) and emphasized the importance of devotion, service, and moral living. Guru Nanak's teachings were recorded in the form of hymns or shabads (singular: shabad).\n\n(D) \"Guru\" comes from the Sanskrit word \"guru,\" meaning \"teacher\" or \"guide.\" In Sikhism, the Guru is considered the spiritual guide or mentor who imparts divine wisdom, leading the disciple on the path of righteousness.\n\n(A) \"Shabad\" refers to the hymns or divine words that Guru Nanak and other Gurus (successors) used in the Sikh religion. These shabads are considered sacred and are central to Sikh practice and devotion.\n\n(B) \"Khalse\" is a Punjabi term that means \"weapon\" or \"tool.\" Although it is not directly related to \"divine revelation,\" it is sometimes linked to the concept of the Guru's teachings as a means to attain spiritual enlightenment.\n\n(C) \"Nam\" is a term that refers to the divine name or reality which is considered equally meritorious as the hymns or shabads. It is considered a means to connect with the divinity, often ascribed to the recitation of the Jap Ji, the first scripture of Sikhism.\n\nTherefore, (D) Guru is the term used to denote \"divine word\" as part of divine revelation in the context of Guru Nanak and Sikhism.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The mi'raj is a pivotal event in Islamic tradition that occurred during the Night Journey (Al-Isra Wa Al-Miraj) as mentioned in the Qur'an. It is the story of Prophet Muhammad's miraculous ascent to heaven in one night, as he rode the holy steed al-Buraq (or the steed Barbark).\n\nStep by step explanation:\n\n1. We start by discussing the background of the mi'raj and its significance in Islamic tradition. It is considered a significant event in the life of Prophet Muhammad as he is believed to have been taken on the Night Journey by Allah from the Holy Mosque in Mecca (Al-Masjid Al-Haram) to the Farthest Mosque (Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa) in Jerusalem, as well as to the seven heavens.\n2. As a crucial event in Muhammad's life, it is important to define what the mi'raj entails. This includes understanding the journey itself, the aspects described during the journey, and the significance of the event for Muslims.\n3. We research various sources, such as Sahih Bukhari, to verify the factual account of the mi'raj and its details.\n4. Based on the research, we ensure a thorough understanding of the journey and its components, including the rider (Prophet Muhammad), the steed, and the route undertaken.\n5. With an in-depth knowledge of the event and its significance, we then choose the most appropriate option among the given choices (A, B, C, and D) that best describes the mi'raj.\n6. After carefully considering the options, we deduce that the mi'raj is (A) Muhammad's miraculous ascent to heaven.
