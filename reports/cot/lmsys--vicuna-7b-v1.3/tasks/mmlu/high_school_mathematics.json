            "model_answer": "Let's begin by using the equation of a line to find the line that is mirrored across the line y = x. The line y = x is a horizontal line, so any point on that line will be reflected to the right or left, depending on the sign of y compared to x. We can represent the equation of this line as y = 0.\n\nNow, let's consider each of the five vertices of the pentagon P. The reflection of P across the line y = x will result in a new pentagon P' with its vertices at the coordinates of the corresponding vertices of P reflected across the line y = x. Therefore, each vertex of P' must satisfy the equation y = x.\n\nWe can find the possible values of y for each vertex of P and check whether they satisfy this equation.\n\nFor the vertex at (\u2013 2, \u2013 4), the corresponding vertex in P' will be at (x, y) = (3, 0).\nFor the vertex at (\u2013 4, 1), the corresponding vertex in P' will be at (x, y) = (4, 1).\nFor the vertex at (\u20131, 4), the corresponding vertex in P' will be at (x, y) = (1, 4).\nFor the vertex at (2, 4), the corresponding vertex in P' will be at (x, y) = (3, 4).\nFor the vertex at (3, 0), the corresponding vertex in P' will be at (x, y) = (4, 0).\n\nWe can see that two of the vertices, (3, 0) and (4, 1), satisfy the equation y = x. However, we need to check which of these two vertices is the one in P''. Since P' is a pentagon, it must have all five vertices, and each vertex must satisfy the equation y = x. Therefore, we must choose one of the two vertices that satisfies y = x.\n\nLet's consider the two vertices that satisfy y = x: (3, 0) and (4, 1). Both of these vertices are on the same side of the line y = x, but (3, 0) is closer to the line than (4, 1). Therefore, (3, 0) is the vertex of P' that satisfies y = x.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C) (2, 2).",

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to carefully follow the given information and use logical reasoning. We are given that John initially had a total of \"x\" hat pins, which he divided into two piles. We are then told that his brother received one-half of one-third of one pile, and that John ended up with \"y\" pins left. Finally, we are given that the total number of pins is \"z\".\n\nFirst, let's find \"y\". John divided his pins into two piles, so each pile had \"x/2\" pins. One-half of one-third of one pile is (1/3)\\*x/2, because (1/3)\\*x/2 represents one-third of x divided by two. John gave his brother this amount of pins, so we can write:\n\n(1/3)\\*x/2 = y\n\nNow, we can solve for \"y\". Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\ny = (1/3)\\*x/2\ny = x/6\n\nSo, John gave his brother one-sixth of one of the two piles of pins.\n\nNext, let's find \"z\". John ended up with \"y\" pins left, and the total number of pins is \"z\". We can write:\n\nx/2 + y = z\n\nWe know that x/2 is the number of pins in one pile, so we subtract y from both sides to find x/2 in terms of z:\n\nz - y = 2x/2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n2z - 2y = 4x\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nz - y = 2x\n\nAdding y to both sides, we get:\n\nz = 2x + y\n\nSo, the total number of pins is \"z\", which equals 2\\*(x + y) where x is the number of pins in one pile and y is one-sixth of one pile.\n\nLet's substitute the expression for y:\n\nz = 2\\*(x + (x/6))\n\nDistributing 2 outside the parentheses, we get:\n\nz = 2x + 2x/3\n\nNow, let's solve for x. We have:\n\nx + x/3 = 2x/3\nx + x/3 = 2\nx = 2 - 3x/2\nx = 2 - (3/2)\\*x\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2/3, we get:\n\nx = (8 - 3x)/3\n\nWe need to find the value of x for which this expression equals 66:\n\n(8 - 3x)/3 = 66\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n8 - 3x = 219\n3x = 227\n3x = 81\nx = 27\n\nSo, the total number of pins is 2\\*(27) = 54. Substituting this value of x into any of the expressions we found for z, we get:\n\nz = 2\\*(27) + (27/6) = 262\n\nFinally, let's compare this answer to the given options. Option A, 396, is incorrect because 2\\*(27) + 27 = 396. Option B, 72, is incorrect because John gave one-sixth of one pile to his brother, not one-third of one pile. Option C, 66, is incorrect because we found that John initially had 54 pins total, not 66.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 36, which is incorrect because the only option not tested was D, and we found that z = 2\\*(27) + (27/6) = 262",
