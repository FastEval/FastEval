We are given that $f(1)=5$, so the point $(1,5)$ lies on the graph of $f$.\n\nNow, suppose we choose any point $(x,f(x))$ with $a<x<b$ between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ on the graph of $f(x)$. We want to show that the portion of the graph between $x=a$ and $x=b$ lies below the line segment connecting $(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$.\n\nFirst, note that the slope of any line segment connecting two points on a strictly convex function is positive. Since $f(x)$ is strictly convex, the slope of any line segment connecting two points on the graph of $f(x)$ is positive.\n\nWe can now prove that the portion of the graph between $x=a$ and $x=b$ lies below the line segment connecting $(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$. Let's assume that this portion goes above the line segment. Let $\\Delta$ be the line segment connecting $(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$, with slope $m$. Then, we have:\n\n$$y = mx + c$$\n\n$$f(x) = mx + c$$\n\nSince $f(1) = 5$ and $f(x)$ is strictly convex, we can choose $a$ and $b$ such that $a<b$ and the portion of the graph between $x=a$ and $x=b$ lies below the line segment $\\Delta$.\n\nTo see why this is true, note that for any point $(x,f(x))$ with $a<x<b$ on the graph of $f(x)$, the slope $m$ of $\\Delta$ is positive. Since $f(x)$ is strictly convex, the slope of any line that passes through any two points on the graph of $f(x)$ is positive. Therefore, the line from $(a,f(a))$ to $(x,f(x))$ slopes downward, and the line from $(x,f(x))$ to $(b,f(b))$ slopes upward. The slope of the line from $(a,f(a))$ to $(1,5)$ is positive, the slope of the line from $(1,5)$ to $(b,f(b))$ is negative, and the slope of the line from $(1,5)$ to $(x,f(x))$ is zero. Since the slope of the line between $(a,f(a))$ and $(x,f(x))$ is negative, and the slope of the line between $(x,f(x))$ and $(b,f(b))$ is positive, the entire portion of the graph between $x=a$ and $x=b$ lies above the line segment connecting $(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$.\n\nTherefore, the range of possible values for $f(1)$ is $(5,9) = (-inf,9)$, which corresponds to choice (B).",
