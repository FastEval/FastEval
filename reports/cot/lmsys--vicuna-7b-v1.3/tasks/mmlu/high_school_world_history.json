By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's start by examining the quotes from A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens and The Prelude by William Wordsworth. We can then identify the adjectives that best describe the authors' views about the French Revolution, and use those adjectives to choose the correct answer.\n\nQuote from A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens:\n\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way\u2014in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\"\n\nThis quote presents a mixed view of the French Revolution. Dickens's usage of phrases like \"the best of times\" and \"the worst of times\" indicates that he saw the Revolution as having both positive and negative aspects. We can also infer that he might have believed the Revolution was chaotic and unpredictable, as he mentions \"the epoch of belief\" and \"the epoch of incredulity.\" However, the quote also suggests that the Revolution was significant and potentially transformative, as the characters are all \"going direct to Heaven\" or \"direct the other way.\"\n\nQuote from The Prelude by William Wordsworth:\n\"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. But to be young was very heaven!\"\n\nWordsworth's quote emphasizes the positive feelings associated with being alive during the French Revolution. The phrase \"bliss was it\" implies that he saw the Revolution as a wonderful and joyous event. Wordsworth also highlights the positive aspects of youth, suggesting that the Revolution gave younger people hope and excitement.\n\nBased on the quotes from Dickens and Wordsworth, we can conclude that the adjectives that best describe their views about the French Revolution are (A) Optimistic and encouraged, and (B) Understanding and accepting.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?\n\n(A) Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.\n(B) Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.\n(C) Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.\n(D) Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty.",

            "model_answer": "For many centuries, trading contacts between Europeans and Sub-Saharan Africans played a crucial role in facilitating slave trade, but also in bringing new products, ideas, and technologies that had a lasting impact on Sub-Saharan African societies. The system of forced labor, which was established during this period, shaped the subsequent history of the African continent, and the legacies of the slave trade continue to affect many aspects of contemporary African societies in various ways.\n\n(D) is the best choice as it explains the relationship between African societies and European powers during this period. Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty. This was a way of protecting their own interests and defending their independence in the face of powerful trade competitors. At the same time, trade with Europeans brought new products, materials, and ideas, which had a lasting impact on Sub-Saharan societies.\n\n(A), (B), and (C) do not fully capture the complexity of the relationship between Sub-Saharan Africans and Europeans during the period in question. 1450-1750 CE saw the rise and fall of empires and kingdoms across the continent, and the expansion of European trade networks across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans had a profound impact on the economies and societies of Sub-Saharan Africa. For example, the introduction of new crops like cassava, yams, and maize from the Americas transformed agriculture in the region, while the demand for African slaves and commodities from Europe played a significant role in the political economy of the continent. However, trading contacts with Europeans was not the sole determinant of African development during this period, and it is crucial to understand the complexity of the relationship between the two regions.",

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.
