            "model_answer": "The passage above is most associated with the formation of the non-aligned movement. The main focus of the passage is on the importance of peace and the need for the people of Asia and Africa to join together to promote it. The speaker, Sukarno, emphasizes the strength of the two continents, citing their combined population of 1.4 billion, and suggests that they can make a significant impact on the world stage by working together. He invites the peoples of Asia and Africa to provide the voice of reason and to mobilize their spiritual, moral, and political strength on the side of peace. This emphasis on unity and the use of one's strength to promote peace and stability is consistent with the idea of non-alignment, which emerged during the same period as the Bandung Conference. Non-alignment was a foreign policy stance in which states did not align themselves with any one major power or bloc, but instead sought to maintain their independence and autonomy in international affairs. Therefore, the formation of the non-aligned movement is the most appropriate answer.",

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

            "model_answer": "The argument in this passage most closely relates to the question of why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era (option B).\n\nTo explain this reasoning, the passage highlights the contrasting experiences of Europe and China in the development and use of gunpowder weaponry. Europe, during the 1200s through the 1400s, focused on improving early cannons, which were heavy and slow to fire, but proved useful in protracted sieges and warfare. In contrast, China, particularly after the mid-1300s, faced a different threat from mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons were of little utility. Therefore, China devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units to effectively combat its deadliest foe.\n\nThis comparison between Europe and China underscores the importance of military technology and innovation in the development of military superiority. The passage suggests that Europe's investment in gunpowder weapons and their subsequent improvements gave Europe an edge over non-Western powers in the modern era, contributing to Western military dominance. In contrast, China's focus on horse archer units did not directly lead to military superiority, as its primary foes were not equipped to combat horse archers effectively.\n\nThus, option B best aligns with the argument in this passage, as it addresses the development of military technology and its impact on global power dynamics.",

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea.

Colonel Bonesteel, in making a surrender arrangement involving Japanese forces in Korea, decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line. This decision had implications for the Korean peninsula. The 38th parallel subsequently became an important border between North Korea and South Korea. The division of Korea had a significant impact on the Koreans living there. The country remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel, with each side having its own political and economic systems. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect as it suggests that Koreans became a part of Japan's territory, but this is not mentioned in the information provided.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect as it states that the Americans established freedom for all Koreans, but this is not mentioned in the information provided.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect as it suggests that the Korean economy never recovered, but there is no information provided about the economic consequences of the surrender arrangement.",

In the period 1450 to 1750 C.E., Sub-Saharan Africans relied heavily on European trading contacts, specifically for the trade of slaves. The need for slave labor in Europe and the Americas created a market for African captives, which in turn led to the exploitation of Africa's human resources by European powers. This dependence on European merchants for the trade of slaves contributed to the economic underdevelopment of Africa, as it limited the development of its own infrastructure and prevented the creation of industries that could have otherwise developed.",

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",

The passage suggests that the massacre was the result of an indigenous violence of the colonized, which challenged the monopoly of violence enjoyed by the British in India. This challenge suggests that the massacre was not an isolated event but was part of a broader uprising against British rule. Therefore, option (B) seems to be the most appropriate response, as it looks at the massacre in the context of the broader systemic brute force with which the British governed India.

Therefore, option (A) does not seem to be supported by the passage. Option (C) seems to be a response that is not supported by the passage, as the events described therein suggest that the massacre was not a praiseworthy patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.
