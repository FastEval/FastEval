We can do this using the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the leftmost object: The quail is stated to be to the left of the other two birds. Therefore, the quail is the leftmost object.\n2. Determine the middle object: The directional terms \"right of\" are used to describe the positions of the blue jay and falcon relative to the quail. Since the blue jay is to the right of the quail, it must be the middle object, with the quail on its left and the falcon on its right.\n3. Identify the rightmost object: The blue jay is stated to be to the right of the falcon. Therefore, the falcon is the rightmost object.\n4. Determine the second from the left object: Counting from left to right, the quail is the leftmost object, the blue jay is the middle object, and the falcon is the rightmost object. Since there is a middle object (the blue jay), the quail cannot be the second from the left. Therefore, the only option left is (B) The quail is the second from the left. Answer: (B)",

They could either be arranged chronologically (oldest to newest), or, since a convertible is often associated with a sportier or more luxurious car, we could assume the order to be arranged in terms of prestige (most prestigious to least). Let's break it down:\n2. If it's arranged chronologically, the oldest vehicle would be first, which means that the tractor would be the oldest, the hatchback second-oldest, and the convertible the newest.\n3. If it's arranged by prestige, we know that the tractor is not the most prestigious, since it's younger than the convertible, which is older, and a hatchback is generally a more modest, basic type of vehicle. So it's reasonable to assume that the order is chronological.\n4. Since we know that the tractor is not the oldest, the oldest must be either the hatchback or the convertible.\n5. We know the convertible is older than the tractor, and since the hatchback is second-newest, that means the convertible must be the oldest, and the hatchback the second-oldest.\n6. Answer: (C) The tractor is the oldest.\n\nNote that the question could also be phrased more clearly to avoid ambiguity, for example by stating that the vehicles are displayed in chronological order, or by specifying that the convertible is a sports car or luxury car.",
