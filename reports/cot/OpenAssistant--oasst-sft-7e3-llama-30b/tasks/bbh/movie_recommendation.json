            "model_answer": "To find a movie similar to Terminator 2 Judgment Day, The Fugitive, The Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking, I would start by considering the themes and genres that these movies have in common. Terminator 2 Judgment Day is an action sci-fi movie that involves time travel, robotics and the protection of a young boy meant to be the future leader of the human resistance. The Fugitive is a criminal justice drama that involves a man wrongly convicted of his wife's murder and his attempt to prove his innocence while being pursued by US Marshals. The Shawshank Redemption is another drama that revolves around a young man convicted of murder who is sent to prison and has to deal with the harsh realities of the penal system. Dead Man Walking is a criminal justice drama that involves a nun who tries to help a convicted murderer on death row. Rocky IV is a sports drama that surrounds Rocky Balboa's match with Ivan Drago, a Soviet boxer. Braveheart is an epic historical drama set in 13th-century Scotland that follows the story of Sir William Wallace, who leads the Scots in a revolt against English rule.\n\nFrom the given options, I find the one that best fits the themes and genres of the four given movies is (A) Walk.
