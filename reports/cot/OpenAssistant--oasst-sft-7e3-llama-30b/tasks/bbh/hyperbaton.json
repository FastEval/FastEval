            "model_answer": "To determine the correct adjective order, let's go through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Start with the subject of the sentence, which is \"cat.\"\n2. Determine which adjective should come first. Generally, adjectives that describe the noun's characteristics or traits should come before more specific adjectives. In this case, we have two adjectives (\"gray\" and \"rubber\") that describe the cat's characteristics. Further analysis is needed to determine which adjective should come first.\n3. Since \"gray\" and \"rubber\" both describe the cat's characteristics, we need to look at other adjectives to determine the order.\n4. The next set of adjectives are \"Mexican\" and \"midsize.\" \"Mexican\" describes the origin or location of the cat, while \"midsize\" describes its size. Because \"Mexican\" is a more general adjective, it should come before \"midsize.\"\n5. Now, we have three adjectives that describe the cat's characteristics: \"gray,\" \"rubber,\" and \"Mexican.\" To determine the correct order, let's consider the relationship between these adjectives. \"Gray\" and \"rubber\" are nouns, while \"Mexican\" is an adjective. Typically, a noun used attributively, like \"rubber,\" should come before a noun used as an adjective, like \"gray.\" However, this rule is not hard and fast, and there are cases where an adjective may come before a noun used attributively.\n6. The final set of adjectives is \"walking\" and \"midsize.\" Both adjectives are describing the cat, so there is no clear indicator of which one should come first.\n7. Considering all of the above, we have the following analysis of the adjective order:\n\n(A) rubber gray walking Mexican midsize cat\n\t* Noun used attributively (\"rubber\") comes before noun used as an adjective (\"gray\").\n\t* General adjective (\"Mexican\") comes before more specific adjective (\"midsize\").\n\t* Verb (\"walking\") comes after all adjectives, which describes the action of the noun (\"cat\").\n(B) midsize gray Mexican rubber walking cat\n\t* General adjective (\"Mexican\") comes before specific adjective (\"gray\").\n\t* Noun used attributively (\"rubber\")",

Determine which adjectives are descriptive of the subject:\nIn this case, \"lovely\" and \"green\" are both descriptive of the subject \"sock.\"\n2. Determine which adjectives are attributive and which are predicative:\nThe adjective \"Filipino\" is considered attributive because it describes a characteristic inherent to the subject (e.g., a sock made in the Philippines). The adjective \"midsize\" is also attributive because it describes a specific characteristic of the item. The adjective \"lovely\" is predicative because it makes a statement about the sock's appearance or quality, but does not describe a specific characteristic of the item.\n3. Determine the correct order:\nFor attributive adjectives, the order depends on the property being described. If the property being described isshape, size or weight, then attributive adjectives related to these properties should come first. In this case, \"midsize\" is related to the size property, so it should come before \"Filipino.\"\nFor predicative adjectives, the order is not as strict. However, when there are multiple predicative adjectives, the order is often from opinion-based to fact-based. In this case, \"lovely\" is more opinion-based than \"green,\" which suggests the color of the sock, so \"lovely\" should come before \"green.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct order is:\n\n(A) lovely midsize green Filipino sock.\n\nThe answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "The correct adjective order for the sentence \"big triangular American leather chair\" is (B) big new triangular American leather chair. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. Determine the noun in the sentence. In this case, it is \"chair.\"\n2. Identify the adjectives in the sentence. In this case, they are \"big,\" \"triangular,\" \"American,\" and \"leather.\"\n3. Determine the grammatical function of each adjective. \"Big\" and \"American\" describe the nature or qualities of the noun, while \"triangular\" and \"leather\" describe its appearance. \"New\" is not an adjective in this sentence.\n4. Arrange the adjectives in the following order:\n\n(a) Determiner (e.g., \"the,\" \"a,\" \"an\")\n(b) Demonstrative (e.g., \"this,\" \"that\")\n(c) Possessive (e.g., \"my,\" \"your,\" \"its\")\n(d) Quantitative (e.g., \"many,\" \"few,\" \"some\")\n(e) Interrogative/exclamative (e.g., \"which,\" \"what,\" \"how\")\n(f) Attributive (e.g., adjectives that describe the nature or qualities of the noun)\n(g) Predicative (e.g., adjectives that link the noun to another noun, as in \"dog food\")\n(h) Numeric (e.g., \"first,\" \"second,\" \"third\")\n(i) Other (e.g., \"funny,\" \"beautiful\")\n5. In this case, the adjectives are all attributive, so they should be arranged in the following order:\n\n(a) Determiner (e.g., \"the\")\n(b) Attributive (e.g., adjectives that describe the nature or qualities of the noun)\n(c) Other (e.g., adjectives that describe the appearance of the noun)\n6. Since there is no determiner in this sentence, we move on to the attributive adjectives. \"American\" and \"leather\" both describe the nature or qualities of the noun, so they should come first.\n7. The remaining adjectives, \"big\" and \"triangular,\" describe the appearance of the noun, so they should come last.\n8. Therefore, the correct adjective order for the sentence \"big triangular American leather chair\" is (B) big new triangular American leather chair.",

Determiners: Determiners such as \"old-fashioned\" and \"Congolese\" come before color adjectives.\n2. Dimension: Adjectives that refer to the size or shape of an object, such as \"square\" or \"round,\" come before other adjectives.\n3. Material: Adjectives referring to the material an object is made of, such as \"wooden\" or \"metal,\" usually come before other adjectives.\n4. Age: Adjectives referring to the age of an object or creature, such as \"old\" or \"new,\" usually come before other adjectives.\n5. Partition: Adjectives referring to the parts of an object or creature, such as \"leg\" or \"head,\" usually come after other adjectives.\n\nIn sentence (A), \"Congolese\" is a proper determiner, \"old-fashioned\" is an appropriate age adjective, and \"square\" is the correct dimension adjective. However, since \"driving\" is not an adjective but a verb, it should come after the noun it modifies. Therefore, sentence (A) is not grammatically correct.\n\nIn sentence (B), \"old-fashioned\" is a proper determiners and appropriate age adjective, \"square\" is the correct dimension adjective. And \"Congolese\" is a proper determiner and appropriate age adjective, \"driving\" is also a correct verb.
