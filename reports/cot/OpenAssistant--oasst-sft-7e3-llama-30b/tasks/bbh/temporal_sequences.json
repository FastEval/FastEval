Lisa woke up at 6 am and went to the airport to meet Emily from 8 am to 10 am. Between 10 am and 1 pm, Lisa attended class at school. From 1 pm to 3 pm, Lisa was at an electronic store fixing someone's computer. After that, Lisa went to a cafe from 3 pm to 8 pm and then to the mall to buy clothes from 8 pm to 10 pm. It's important to note that the football field was closed after 10 pm.\n\nNow, let's find the available time windows for Lisa to go to the football field. She can't go during the times she was doing something else, which are from:\n\n* 6 am to 8 am (Lisa went to meet Emily at the airport)\n* 8 am to 10 am (Lisa met Emily at the airport)\n* 10 am to 1 pm (Lisa attended class at school)\n* 1 pm to 3 pm (Lisa was at an electronic store fixing someone's computer)\n* 3 pm to 8 pm (Lisa was at a cafe)\n* 8 pm to 10 pm (Lisa was at the mall)\n\nSince the football field was closed after 10 pm, we also remember that Lisa cannot go to the football field if it's already closed.\n\nAfter remembering these details, we can conclude that the time window when Lisa could have gone to the football field is:\n\n(D) 8 pm to 10 pm\n\n remember this as the answer.",

We also know that Hannah could not have gone to the beach after 8pm, because the beach was closed at that time.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining time period during which Hannah could have gone to the beach is between 9am and 7pm, when Ashley saw her getting a coffee at the cafe. This is the only window of time when Hannah was not accounted for by the other witnesses.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 9am to 7pm.",
