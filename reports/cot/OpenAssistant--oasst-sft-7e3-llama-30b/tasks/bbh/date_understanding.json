To do this, we can add one week to the date.\n\nThere are several ways to add one week to a date. One common method is to add 7 days to the date. However, this method assumes that the starting date is a specific day of the week, which may not always be the case.\n\nAnother method is to add the number of days from the starting day of the week to the starting date, plus 7. This method works regardless of the starting day of the week.\n\nTo determine the starting day of the week, we can use the ISO 8601 standard, which defines that Monday is the first day of the week, and Sunday is the last day of the week.\n\nUsing this standard, we can determine that October 16, 1924 was a Saturday. Therefore, we can add the number of days from Saturday to the previous Sunday, plus 7.\n\nThe number of days from Saturday to Sunday is 1, since Sunday is the next day after Saturday. Therefore, we can add 1 + 7 to get 8.\n\nTo find the date one week from October 16, 1924, we add 8 to October 16, 1924, which becomes 10/24/1924. Since this date is a Monday, we need to determine the date one week later, which is 10/31/1924.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 10/21/1924.",

Therefore, we need to find out which day in May one year ago was, which is April 30, 2021 (since there is no 31st day in April).\n\nSo, the correct option is April 30, 2021, which corresponds to option (A) 06/14/2003, since the dates are not in chronological order.",
