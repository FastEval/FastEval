            "model_answer": "Correct answer: (B) 10/22/1924\n\nHere are the steps to obtain the answer:\n\n1. The question mentions a meeting being rescheduled from \"today\" to tomorrow on 10/16/1924. \"Tomorrow\" refers to 10/17/1924. Subtracting the original \"today\" date from the rescheduled date gives 10/16/1924 - 10/17/1924 = -1 day.\n2. Since there is no negative number of days, we add 1 day to correct for this. This means \"tomorrow\" is really 10/17/1924 + 1 day = 10/18/1924.\n3. We know that we need to find the date \"one week from today\" on 10/22/1924. \"One week\" translates to 7 days.\n4. Adding 7 days to 10/18/1924 gives 10/22/1924 + 7 days = 10/29/1924.\n5. However, the answer options only contain 10/22/1924 as the \"one week from today\" date. This suggests that the date provided must be a typo.\n6. Going back to 10/22/1924, \"one week from today\" means that the date must be either 10/29/1924 - 10/22/1924 = 7 days after 10/22/1924 or 10/22/1924 + 7 days = 10/29/1924.\n7. Both 10/29/1924 and 10/22/1924 are given as answer options. \"One week from today\" refers to adding 7 days to the date of \"today\" (not next week). Therefore, 10/22/1924 must be the correct answer since it is 7 days after 10/18/1924 (which is \"today\" assuming \"tomorrow\" is 10/17/1924 + 1 extra day to account for there being no \"negative days\").\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely to be (B) 10/22/1924.",

We need to find out the current date and add the number of days to it.\n\nWe can use the number of days passed to calculate the date. Let's assume today's date is x. We know that 176 days have passed since March 20, 2020. So, we can write the equation:\n\nx = March 20, 2020 + 176 days\n\nWe can solve this equation to find the current date, which is x. Once we have the current date, we can add 1 day to it to find the date tomorrow.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n(D) 07/26/2020\n\nExplanation:\n\n* We are given that 176 days have passed since March 20, 2020.\n* We need to find out the current date and add 1 day to it to find the date tomorrow.\n* We can use the equation: x = March 20, 2020 + 176 days to find the current date.\n* Solving the equation, we get x = July 26, 2020.\n* Adding 1 day to it, we get the answer: July 27, 2020, which is the date tomorrow.\n* The answer is: (D) 07/26/2020.",
