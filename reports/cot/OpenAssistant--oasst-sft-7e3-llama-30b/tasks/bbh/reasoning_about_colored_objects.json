These are both non-green and non-yellow objects on the nightstand. We account for these two objects so far.\n2. The red stress ball is also not yellow, so it is safe to assume that the red stress ball is also green (as it is not listed as being either). We account for this third object, so 3 - 2 = 1, there is 1 remaining object that is neither yellow nor green on the nightstand. We account for these three objects so far.\n3. The green fidget spinner has no accounted for objects left, so it must be yellow. This tells us that there was no accounted for green object, and therefore, there is 1 - 0 = 1 accounted for blue object (the blue keychain) on the nightstand. Then, 3 + 1 = 4 objects are accounted for.\n4. Then, the answer must be 1 remaining object that is neither yellow nor green on the nightstand, giving answer choice B.\n\n(B) one",
