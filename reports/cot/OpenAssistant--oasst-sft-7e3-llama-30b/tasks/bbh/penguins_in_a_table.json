We can find the age of a giraffe by looking at its corresponding row in the table and checking the \"age\" column. For example, we can see that Jody is 5 years old.\n\nWe can then compare the ages of each giraffe to determine which ones are more than 5 years old. We can do this either by looking at each row in the table individually, or by creating a list of all the ages and using a logical statement such as \"age > 5\" to filter out the giraffes that are less than 5 years old.\n\nAfter determining which giraffes are more than 5 years old, we can count them and compare the result to the answer options. In this case, there are 3 giraffes that are more than 5 years old: Jody, Gladys, and Donna.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C) 3, and the complete answer is: \"The number of giraffes that are more than 5 years old is 3.\"",
