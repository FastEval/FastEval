We are asked to count how many penguins are less than 8 years old in a table that has five penguins: Louis, James, Vincent, Gwen, and one penguin that we will add and then remove later.\n\nThe second step is to convert the age of each penguin to a Boolean value indicating whether they are less than 8 years old or not. For example, Louis is 7 years old, so he is less than 8 years old, so we will assign the value `True` to the Boolean variable for Louis. James is 12 years old, so he is not less than 8 years old, so we will assign the value `False` to the Boolean variable for James.\n\nThe third step is to create a variable to store the count of penguins less than 8 years old. We will initialize this variable to 0.\n\nThe fourth step is to iterate over each penguin in the table and update the count variable based on the value of the Boolean variable for each penguin. For example, since Louis is less than 8 years old, we will increment the count by 1. Since James is not less than 8 years old, we will not increment the count.\n\nThe fifth step is to delete the penguin named Bernard from the table. We do this by removing the row from the table.\n\nThe sixth step is to repeat steps 3-5 for each of the remaining penguins in the table, updating the Boolean variable and count variable as needed.\n\nThe seventh step is to output the final count of penguins less than 8 years old. Since the count is 3 (Louis, Gwen, and James), we output (C) 3 as the answer.\n\nIn summary, to answer the question:\n\n* Understand the question and the table of penguins\n* Convert the ages of the penguins to Boolean values\n* Create a variable to store the count of penguins less than 8 years old and initialize it to 0\n* Iterate over each penguin in the table and update the count variable\n* Delete the penguin named Bernard from the table\n* Repeat steps 3-5 for each remaining penguin in the table\n* Output the final count of penguins less than 8 years old.",
