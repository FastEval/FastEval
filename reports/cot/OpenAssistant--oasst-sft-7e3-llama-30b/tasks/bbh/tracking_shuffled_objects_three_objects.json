Since Claire was originally playing benchwarmer, and was swapped with Alice and Bob, it follows that at the end of the match Claire is still playing benchwarmer.\n6. Our goal is to determine the position of Alice at the end of the match. We know that Alice was originally playing cheerleader, and was swapped with Claire and Bob. We also know that Claire was playing benchwarmer at the end of the match.

However, the problem states that only two pairs of players swapped positions, so this is not possible. The only other pair of positions that Alice could have swapped into is right winger (played by Bob at the end of the match), but the problem states that Alice played right winger earlier in the match when Bob was playing benchwarmer. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Alice played cheerleader at the end of the match, which is ruled out by the problem's information because Claire played cheerleader at the end of the match. Therefore, the only possibility left is that Alice played benchwarmer at the end of the match.\n7. The answer is (C) benchwarmer.",

We need to figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end of the song after all three switches have taken place.\n4. To start, let's consider the first partner switch. Claire and Alice switch partners, which means Alice is now dancing with Claire's initial partner, who is Sam. This means we can eliminate option (A) and (B) since Helga is not Claire's initial partner, and Patrick is not Alice's initial partner.\n5. Next, let's consider the second partner switch. Claire and Bob switch partners, which means Claire is now dancing with Bob's initial partner, who is Patrick. This means we can eliminate option (C) since Sam is not Bob's initial partner.\n6. Finally, we have the last partner switch: Alice and Bob switch partners. This means Alice is now dancing with Bob's initial partner, who is Patrick. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Patrick.\n7.
