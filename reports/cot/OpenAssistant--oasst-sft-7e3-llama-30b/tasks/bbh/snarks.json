This is obviously untrue, as depression is a mental illness that requires proper treatment and support.\n* The use of the word \"just\" in the statement emphasizes the absurdity and lack of empathy in the statement.

Therefore, this statement does not seem likely to be sarcastic.\n\n(B) Yeah, democracy is taught as a prime example of a governing system.\n\nDemocracy is generally considered to be a \"prime example\" of a governing system because it involves the participation of citizens in the decision-making process. However, it is possible to imagine situations in which someone might sarcastically state that democracy is a prime example of a governing system. For example, if someone were to say this in response to a suggestion that democracy is always a positive system, they might be using sarcasm to indicate that they do not believe this is true.
