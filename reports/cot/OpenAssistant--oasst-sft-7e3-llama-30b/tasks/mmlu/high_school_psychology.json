While delusions of grandeur can also be present in other mental disorders, such as bipolar disorder and narcissistic personality disorder, they are most commonly associated with schizophrenia.",

This is because it suggests that humans are motivated by different needs and desires, and that some needs, such as physiological needs, are more fundamental and must be met before other needs can be satisfied. This means that they are more important and imperative to survival than other needs.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.

Riles.\n* To answer the question, we need to look at the given options and identify which one reflects the precedent established in the case.\n* The first option, (A), states that the precedent established the provision of a free, appropriate public education for students with disabilities. This is not accurate, as the case does not involve students with disabilities.\n* The second option, (B), states that the precedent established the provision of bilingual education for English-language learners. This is also not accurate, as the case does not involve bilingual education or English-language learners.\n* The third option, (C), states that the precedent established that schools be held responsible for providing tests that do not discriminate on the basis of race. This is closer to the answer, as Larry P. v. Riles established that schools cannot use race-based tests. However, the precedent established in the case went further than just holding schools responsible, so this option is also not accurate.\n* The final option, (D), states that the precedent established the assignment of similar funding to athletic activities for boys and girls. This is not accurate, as Larry P. v. Riles did not involve athletics or funding.\n* Based on the above analysis, the answer is: None of the above.\n* Answer: (D)",

            "question": "The heritability for traits of a cloned population is\n\n(A) 0%\n(B) 25%\n(C) 50%\n(D) 75%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what heritability means in the context of genetics. Heritability is a measure of how much of the variation in a particular trait can be attributed to genetic factors, as opposed to environmental factors. For example, if a population of mice has a high heritability for a certain trait, it means that the genetic makeup of the mice is a major factor in determining that trait, while if the heritability is low, it means that environmental factors have a bigger impact on the trait.\n\nThe heritability of a trait is typically expressed as a percentage, and is calculated by comparing the similarity of traits in identical twins (who share the same DNA) to the similarity of traits in fraternal twins (who share only half of their DNA). If the identical twins are more similar in a certain trait than the fraternal twins, it suggests that genetic factors play a big role in that trait, and therefore the heritability will be high.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question depends on the specific clone population in question, and the degree to which the clones share the same genetic makeup. If the clones are genetically identical and therefore have exactly the same DNA, then the heritability for any traits that are determined by genetics will be very high, possibly approaching 100%. However, if the clone population is not truly genetically identical, or if environmental factors play a large role in determining certain traits, then the heritability will be lower.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is: it depends.",

            "model_answer": "Answer: B (They should provide professional but not administrative supervision.)\n\nReasoning: The position statement from the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) stipulates that school psychologists who are supervising in a school district should provide professional but not administrative supervision. Administrative supervision refers to tasks related to personnel management, budgeting, and other administrative tasks that are typically the responsibility of district-level supervisors or other administrators. Instead, school psychologists who are supervising should focus on providing professional supervision, which involves guiding and evaluating the clinical work of school psychology interns and other staff, ensuring that services are delivered in accordance with best practices and district policies, and providing ongoing training and support to improve the quality of services provided to students and families. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that school psychologists who are supervising in a school district should provide professional but not administrative supervision.",

Word list is a classic example of this phenomenon. The serial position effect consists of a peak at the beginning (the \"prime\") and a gradually declining curve towards the end of the list (the \"decrement). The middle of the list experiences the smallest proportion of forgetting.\n\nIn this case it is useful to mention that, it is possible that Dan might remember the word that he was surprised to see, or knew the definition of, or did not forget to study, as words have individual differences. So, it might be worth check if there are not any words that stand out of the list for him, that would help him to remember the rest, and then, he should try to focus in the middle part of the list.",
