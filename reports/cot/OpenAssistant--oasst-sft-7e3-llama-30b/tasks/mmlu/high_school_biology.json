The mRNA contains a sequence of nucleotides and the sequence is translated into protein.\n\nStep 2: The start codon is the initiation codon that starts the translation of the mRNA into protein. The most common start codon is AUG which codes for the amino acid methionine.\n\nStep 3: Any change in the nucleotide sequence following the start codon could potentially have a deleterious effect on the protein synthesis process.\n\nStep 4: A deletion of a single nucleotide (A) and a deletion of a nucleotide triplet (B) could result in frameshifting, a change in the reading frame of the mRNA resulting in a different translated protein.\n\nStep 5: A single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the first codon position (C) and a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the third codon position (D) would also seriously affect the translation of the mRNA into protein and result in a different translated protein.\n\nStep 6: Among the given options, a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the third codon position (D) and a deletion of a nucleotide triplet (B) would have similar deleterious effects as they both would result in frameshifting.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) longitudinal section of a shoot tip would most likely provide examples of mitotic cell divisions.\n\nTo answer this question, we must first understand what provides examples of mitotic cell divisions. This refers to areas where cells are undergoing cell division through the process of mitosis, where a single cell divides to form two identical daughter cells.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate the incorrect options. Option (A) a cross section of muscle tissue, and option (B) a cross section of an anther (site of pollen production in a flower), are both examples of mature tissue. This means they are made up of fully differentiated cells that are no longer dividing. Therefore, these options would be unlikely to provide examples of mitotic cell divisions.\n\nOption (D) a cross section of a leaf is also an example of mature tissue, but it is slightly more likely to provide examples of mitotic cell divisions because it is made up of tissues that are actively growing. However, there are other areas of the plant where cell division is more likely to occur, which brings us to option (C) a longitudinal section of a shoot tip.\n\nA shoot tip is the growing point of a plant where cells are constantly dividing to produce new tissue. The shoot tip is a region of active cell division and thus would most likely provide examples of mitotic cell divisions.\n\nAnswer: (C) longitudinal section of a shoot tip",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The question asks which of the options (A) through (D) are possessed by Invertebrate immune systems. The correct answer is (B) Phagocytes and (D) Helper T-cells.\n\nFirst, we must look at the definition of Invertebrates. These are animals that lack a vertebral column or backbone. Invertebrates include insects like bees and flies, and crustaceans such as crabs. The immune system in invertebrates is essential to protect against pathogens. The lack of a particular type of immune cell does not mean that the immune system is ineffective but rather that it uses different mechanisms.\n\nThe Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are T-cells and part of the vertebrate immune system. The function of Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes is to kill cancer cells or infected cells. T-cells and antibodies are two main components of the vertebrate adaptive immune system and are absent in invertebrates. Therefore, (A) Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are not possessed by Invertebrate immune systems.\n\nPhagocytes are an essential part of the innate immune system. Phagocytes engulf and digest bacteria, debris and foreign material such as dead cells. Granulocytes and macrophages are types of phagocytes. Granulocytes are part of the vertebrate immune system. Macrophages, on the other hand, are present in both invertebrates and vertebrates. They are essential cells of the immune response. Macrophages can be found in invertebrates and are a type of phagocytes. Therefore, (B) Phagocytes are possessed by Invertebrate immune systems.\n\nB-cells are an essential component of the adaptive immune response. They are responsible for producing antibodies. Antibodies recognize and attack specific microorganisms. B-cells are part of the vertebrate immune system. Invertebrates lack B-cells, but they have an alternative mechanism to fight pathogens. Therefore, (C) B-cells are not possessed by Invertebrate immune systems.\n\nHelper T-cells are T-cells and part of the adaptive immune system. They help activate other T-cells and antibodies.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(D) Selection for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes.\n\nThis is because in the presence of pike-cichlids, which are visual predators of algae-eating fish, smaller body size can provide a survival advantage for the algae-eaters. Smaller fish are more agile and can more easily evade predators. This means that over many generations, the individuals in the population that exhibit a precocious sexual maturity at smaller sizes would be the most likely to reproduce and pass on their genes to the next generation, thus resulting in a shift in the population towards smaller overall body sizes in the algae-eaters.\n\nAnswer: (D) Selection for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes.",
