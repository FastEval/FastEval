            "model_answer": "(C) True, False\n\nThe statement about the linear regression estimator is generally true because linear regression has the smallest mean squared error (MSE) among all unbiased estimators. However, AdaBoost is not a linear regression method, but a ensemble learning method that uses a set of weak classifiers to form a stronger one. So statement (A) is not correct.\n\nRegarding the coefficients assigned by AdaBoost, it is true that they are always non-negative. AdaBoost assigns weights to the training examples, and the weights are multiplied by the sign of the prediction made by the weak classifier for that example. As a result, the weights are always non-negative, and the coefficients are positive or zero. So statement (B) is correct.\n\nCombining the two statements, we have (C) True, False.",
