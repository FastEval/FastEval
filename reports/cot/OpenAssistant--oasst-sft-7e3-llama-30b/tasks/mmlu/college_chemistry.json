            "model_answer": "Step 1: Let's first define the rate of a chemical reaction.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction can be defined as the amount of reactant consumed or product formed per unit time.\n\nStep 2: Since this is a zero-order reaction, it means that the rate of the reaction is independent of the concentration of reactant A.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, the rate equation for a zero-order reaction must relate the rate of the reaction to the concentration of reactant A.\n\nStep 4: We know that the rate constant \"k\" relates to the rate of a reaction, so it makes sense that our rate equation will involve \"k\".\n\nStep 5: We also know that the rate of a zero-order reaction is proportional to the concentration of reactant A.\n\nStep 6: So, the rate equation for a zero-order reaction should have the form:\n\nr = k * [A]\n\nStep 7: This is the correct option, so the answer is (C) r = k [A].\n\nAnswer: (C) r = k [A].",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Answer: (B) only for constant pressure processes\n\nStep 1: Let's start by understanding the variables in the equation. \u0394H stands for the enthalpy change, \u0394U stands for the internal energy change, P stands for pressure and \u0394V stands for the volume change.\n\nStep 2: Next, we need to understand the meaning of a process in thermodynamics. In thermodynamics, a process refers to a change in the state of a system. Internal energy and enthalpy are state functions, meaning their values depend only on the final and initial states of the system and not the path followed between them. In contrast, work and heat are path functions, meaning their values depend on the path followed between the initial and final states.\n\nStep 3: Let's now consider the equation \u0394H = \u0394U + P\u0394V. This equation describes the change in enthalpy (\u0394H) in terms of the change in internal energy (\u0394U) and the pressure (P) times the volume change (\u0394V).\n\nStep 4: The equation implies that the change in enthalpy is equal to the change in internal energy plus the pressure times the volume change. Under constant pressure conditions, the volume change can be calculated from the pressure change using the ideal gas law or any other governing equation for the given substance.\n\nStep 5: Now, let's consider the different processes mentioned in the options.\n\n* Option A (always) is incorrect because the equation is only valid under constant pressure conditions.\n* Option C (only for constant temperature processes) is incorrect because the equation holds for any type of process as long as the pressure is constant. In other words, the equation is independent of temperature.\n* Option D (only for constant volume processes) is also incorrect because the equation includes the volume change and can be used for processes where the volume is changing, as long as the pressure is constant.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the correct answer is Option B (only for constant pressure processes).\n\nAnswer: (B) only for constant pressure processes",

That feature is:\n\n(D) Unpaired electrons.\n\nParamagnetism is due to unpaired electrons in the valence level, while ferromagnetism is due to unpaired electrons in the material's internal cells or ions.

T1 and T2 are two properties of a nucleus that are used in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\n2. T1 represents the lifetime of the excited spin state and T2 represents the transverse relaxation time.\n3. The T1 of a nucleus can be longer than its T2 if the nucleus is subjected to molecular motions with low frequency.\n4. The reason for this is that low frequency molecular motions cause the spin system to be misaligned, leading to longer T1 relaxation times.\n5. Therefore, statement (A) which states that T1 is sensitive to very low-frequency molecular motions is the most accurate statement to explain why the T1 of a nucleus is sometimes longer than its T2.\n\nFinal Answer: (A)",
