            "model_answer": "This problem requires some statistical knowledge and basic mathematical skills. So, we'll approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the problem**: The quantum efficiency of a photon detector is given to be 0.1. We need to calculate the average number of detected photons when 100 photons are sent into the detector, one after the other. We also need to calculate the root mean square deviation (rms deviation) of the detected photons.\n2. **Understand the terms**: The term `quantum efficiency` refers to the probability of detecting a photon when it interacts with the detector. In this case, it is 0.1 or 10%. The term `rms deviation` is a statistical measure that tells us how much the detected photons deviate from the average value.\n3. **Use the given information**: The quantum efficiency of the detector is 0.1, which means only 10% of the photons will be detected. If 100 photons are sent into the detector, one after the other, only 10 photons will be detected on average.\n4. **Use mathematical calculations**: To calculate the rms deviation, we need to find the square root of the average number of detected photons. The square root of 10 is approximately 3.16. So, the rms deviation will be around 3.16/\u221a10 \u2248 1.\n5. **Check the options**: Based on the calculations above, the correct answer is:\n(C) an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 1\n\nThe answer is (C).",

The index of refraction for light in the oil is lower than in the water.

This means that during the process, the system is always in a state of thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.\n\nWith this definition in mind, we can now examine the statements to determine which of them is true.\n\n(A) There are no changes in the internal energy of the system. Our first statement, (A), is false. During a reversible thermodynamic process, the internal energy of the system does change. However, these changes are such that the work done by the system is equal to the heat absorbed by the system, and vice versa.\n\n(B) The temperature of the system remains constant during the process. Our second statement, (B), is also false. During a reversible thermodynamic process, the temperature of the system does change, but only to maintain thermal equilibrium with the surroundings.\n\n(C) The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged. Our third statement, (C), is false. During any process, including a reversible thermodynamic process, the total entropy of the system and its environment must increase.\n\n(D) The entropy of the system and its environment must increase. Our final statement, (D), is true.
