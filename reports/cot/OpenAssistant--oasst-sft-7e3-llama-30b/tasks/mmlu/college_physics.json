            "model_answer": "First, let's define the quantum efficiency of a photon detector as the probability of detecting a photon when it interacts with the detector. In this case, the quantum efficiency is 0.1, which means that on average, only 10% of the photons that interact with the detector will be detected.\n\nNext, let's consider the scenario where 100 photons are sent into the detector, one after the other. Since the quantum efficiency is 0.1, we expect that on average, only 10 photons will be detected (i.e. 10% of 100). However, due to the statistical nature of quantum mechanics, the actual number of photons detected will fluctuate from trial to trial.\n\nTo calculate the rms deviation of the number of detected photons, we can use the formula:\n\nrms deviation = \u221a(mean\u00b2 - mean\u00b2) / \u221an\n\nwhere mean is the average number of detected photons, and n is the number of trials. In this case, the mean is 10, and there are 100 trials, so the rms deviation is approximately 3.16.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the average number of detected photons per trial by dividing the mean by the number of trials, which gives us an average of 10 (/100 trials).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 4.",

            "question": "White light is normally incident on a puddle of water (index of refraction 1.33). A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "White light contains many different wavelengths of light. When white light is incident on an interface between two media with different indices of refraction, different wavelengths will be reflected, with the angle of reflection being determined by the index of refraction of each medium. The wavelength with the biggest index of refraction difference will be reflected with the highest intensity. Here, the white light is normally incident on a puddle of water, which has an index of refraction of 1.33, and a thin layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle.\n\nLet's first determine the critical angle for light incident on the water. The critical angle can be determined from Snell's Law, which states: n1 * sin(theta1) = n2 * sin(theta2), where n1 is the index of refraction of the first medium, theta1 is the angle of incidence, n2 is the index of refraction of the second medium, and theta2 is the angle of refraction. Assuming the light is incident at normal incidence (theta1 = 90 degrees), we can solve for theta1 and theta2:\n\n1.33 * sin(90) = 1.5 * sin(theta2)\nsin(90) = 1.5 * sin(theta2) / 1.33\ntheta2 = arcsin(1.33 / 1.5) * 90 = 70 degrees\n\nSince the light is reflected from the water at 70 degrees, the critical angle is 90 - 70 = 20 degrees. Any angle larger than 20 degrees will be totally reflected.\n\nNow let's consider the layers of oil and water. Since the index of refraction of the oil is higher than the index of refraction of the water, the light will be reflected from both the water-oil interface and the oil-air interface. The maximum intensity will be at the wavelength where the difference in index of refraction between the water and oil is largest. The wavelengths where the index of refraction of the water and oil are farthest apart are longest. Therefore, the answer is (D) 650 nm, as this corresponds to the wavelength with the largest index of refraction difference between the water and oil. The answer is:\n\nD",
