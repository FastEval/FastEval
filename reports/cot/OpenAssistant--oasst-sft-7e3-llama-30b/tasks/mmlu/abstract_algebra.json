We have x^5 + x^3 + x^2 + 2x when x=0:\n\n0^5 + 0^3 + 0^2 + 2(0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n\nStep 2: Check if 0 is a root of the polynomial. We have seen that it is. However, it is a good practice to check if it is a double root or a single root. This is done by evaluating the derivative of the polynomial at x=0:\n\n(5*x^4 + 3*x^2 + 2) when x=0 = 0*4 + 0*2 + 2 = 0\n\nSince the value of the polynomial and its derivative at x=0 both equal 0, we have found a double root.\n\nStep 3: Look for other solutions by using the quadratic formula. Since we have found a double root, we can consider the polynomial as a quadratic in (x-0):\n\n(x-0)^2 = (x^2 - 2x) + 1 = (x^2 - 2x - 1) = (x - 1)^2 - 1\n\nThe discriminant must be a square in the field in order to have a solution in the field. Since we are working in Z_5, the only square roots of 1 are 1 and 4. Therefore, the only other solution is x=4.\n\nStep 4: Check if the solution is correct. We have found that x=4 is a solution. Let's verify it:\n\n(x-0)^2 = (x^2 - 2x) + 1 = (x^2 - 2x - 1) = (x - 1)^2 - 1 when x=4 = (4-1)^2 - 1 = 1^2 - 1 = 0\n\nTherefore, the polynomial has a double zero at x=0 and a single zero at x=4.\n\nStep 5: Output the answer.\n\n(C) 0,1",

The Factor Theorem states that if a polynomial f(x) has a factor (x - a) and a belongs to the field that the polynomial is defined over, then f(a) = 0.\nStep 4: We need to find factors of the form (x - a) where a belongs to Z_7.
