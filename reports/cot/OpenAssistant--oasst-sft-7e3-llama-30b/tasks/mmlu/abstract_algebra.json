            "model_answer": "Here's how we can find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q:\n\nWe first need to determine which irrational numbers are contained in the specified field. We can observe that Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is contained in the specified field, since sqrt(18) = sqrt(6)^3 = (sqrt(6)^2)^3 = (sqrt(2)^2 * sqrt(3))^3 = 2 * 3 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(3) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(3) * 2 * 3 = sqrt(2) * sqrt(3) * 6.\n\nSince sqrt(18) can be expressed in terms of sqrt(2) and sqrt(3), this means that the minimal polynomial of sqrt(18) (over Q) must be a polynomial that is divisible by x^2 - 2 (since sqrt(18) = sqrt(2)^2 * sqrt(3)) as well as a polynomial that is divisible by x^2 - 3 (since sqrt(18) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(3)^2). In other words, the minimal polynomial of sqrt(18) must be a polynomial that is divisible by x^4 - 2 * x^2 + 2, or equivalently, by x^4 - 2 * x^2 - 2.\n\nSince each of x^2 - 2 and x^4 - 2 * x^2 - 2 must divide the minimal polynomial of sqrt(18), this means that sqrt(18) is an algebraic number of degree 4 over Q. In other words, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (D) 6.",

Let's consider a group with an element of order 15.\n2. According to elementary group theory, any group of a prime-power order (in this case, 15) must contain a unique subgroup of the same order (15), which is sometimes called elementary abelian.\n3. In an elementary abelian group of order 15, elementary abelianness ensures that all non-identity elements have order 3 or 15, since 3 and 15 are the only elementary abelian subgroups of the group of order 2 and 5, respectively.\n4. Let's consider the case when the element of order 15 in the original group is not a generator of the group. In this case, it belongs to a subgroup of order 15, which elementary abelianness ensures must have 8 elements of order 15.\n5. If the element of order 15 is a generator of the original group, then it alone cannot form a subgroup of order 15, but it can form a group of order 3 with another element of order 3. However, we can pair this element with 7 other elements of order 15 to form a group of order 15 with 8 elements of order 15.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true, as the group must have at least 8 elements of order 15.\n\nStatement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Let's consider a group with more than 8 elements of order 15.\n2. Since the group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must contain at least one additional element of order 3. In general, there will be more elementary abelian subgroups of order 3 in the group.\n3. If we consider elementary abelian subgroups of order 3 and 15 together, they form a semi-direct product where the subgroup of order 3 acts on the subgroup of order 15. In the context of their orde",

To prove this, we need to show that if G is a group and f: G -> H is a homomorphism, then H is isomorphic to a factor group of G. We know that the kernel of f is a normal subgroup of G, so we can quotient out by the kernel to get a factor group K of G. Then define a map g: K -> H by g(k) = f(k) for all k in K. This map is well-defined because if k is in the kernel of f, then f(k) = e, the identity of H, which is in the image of g. Moreover, g is an isomorphism because it is both one-to-one and onto. This shows that every homomorphic image of a group is isomorphic to a factor group of that group.\n2. Statement 2 says that the homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G. To prove this, we need to show that every factor group of G is isomorphic to the homomorphic image of some homomorphism from G to some group H. Given some factor group K of G, we can define a homomorphism f: G -> H = Sym(K) by f(g) = [k1, k2, ..., Kn], where [k1, k2, ..., Kn] is the action of g on K. This is well-defined because the action of g is a permutation of K, so [k1, k2, ..., Kn] is a well-defined element of Sym(K), which is a group. Moreover, if g and h are in G, then [k1, k2, ..., Kn] = [k1', k2', ..., Kn'] whenever g(k1) = k1' and g(k2) = k2' and ... and g(Nn) = Nn'. This means that f is a homomorphism. Finally, we can quotient out by the kernel of f to get a factor group K of G, and the resulting homomorphism is isomorphic to f. This shows that every factor group of a group G is isomorphic to the homomorphic image of some homomorphism from G to some group H.\n3. From the steps above, we can see that whenever Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 will be true; however, the converse is not necessarily true. There exist groups where every homomorphic image is isomorphic to a factor group, but not every homomorphism from G to H is isomorphi",

            "model_answer": "(A) True, True.\n\nThe statement \"a ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}\" is a general property of ring homomorphisms. This means that if a ring homomorphism is one-to-one, then its kernel must be {0}. Conversely, if the kernel of a ring homomorphism is {0}, then the homomorphism is one-to-one.\n\nStatement 2, \"Q is an ideal in R,\" means that Q is a non-empty subset of R such that for any a, b in Q and any r in R, a + b and ar are also in Q.\n\nNow, let's consider the given statements:\n\n1. A ring homomorphism f: R \u2192 S is one-to-one.\n2. Q is a non-empty subset of R such that for any a, b in Q and any r in R, a + b and ar are also in Q.\n\nWe need to verify if the given statements lead to a contradiction or not. Let's assume that there exist a, b in Q such that ab = 0. Then, we can conclude that either a = 0 or b = 0 since ab = 0 implies a = 0 or b = 0.\n\nIf a = 0, then we have b in Q and 0 in R satisfy the property that there exists a homomorphism f: R \u2192 S such that f(a) = f(0) = 0 (since f(a) = f(a)(1) = a(1) = 0). This contradicts the fact that f is one-to-one.\n\nIf b = 0, then we have a in Q and 0 in R satisfy the property that there exists a homomorphism f: R \u2192 S such that f(a) = f(0) = 0. This again contradicts the fact that f is one-to-one.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that in order for there to be no contradiction, we must have f(Q) not containing 0 in S. Since f is a homomorphism, f(Q) is an ideal in S, and since f(Q) does not contain 0, we have f(Q) = {0}. This contradicts the assumption that f is one-to-one. Hence, our assumption that there exist a, b in Q such that ab = 0 leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that for any a, b in Q, ab != 0 and f(a) != f(b) (since f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = f(b)f(a) = f(ba) = f(a)f(b) = f(b)f(a), and f(a) != f(b)).\n\nNow consider the function g: R -> R defined by g(a) = f(a) - f(1)f(a). Then, g is a ring homomorphism since:\n\n* g(1) = f(1) - f(1)f(1) = f(1) - f(1)^2 = 0\n* g(a + b) = f(a + b) - f(1)f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) - f(1)f(a) - f(1)f(b) = g(a) + g(b)\n* g(ar) = f(ar) - f(1)f(ar) = f(a)f(r) - f(1)f(a)f(r) = g(a)g(r)\n\nSince g(1) = 0, g sends R onto g(R) = {g(a) : a in R}, which i",
