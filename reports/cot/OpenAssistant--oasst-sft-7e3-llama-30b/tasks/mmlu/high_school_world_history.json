            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the Passage\nThe passage is a quote by Indonesian leader Sukarno, speaking at the Bandung Conference in 1955. He emphasizes the importance of preserving peace, and suggests that Asia and Africa can contribute to this goal by mobilizing their spiritual, moral, and political strength. The quote mentions the size of the Asian and African population (1.4 billion).\n\nStep 2: Identify Key Words and Phrases\nThe key words and phrases in the passage include \"preserving peace,\" \"Asia and Africa,\" \"spiritual,\" \"moral,\" \"political strength,\" and \"1.4 billion.\"\n\nStep 3: Consider Possible Answers\nThe passage mentions the need to preserve peace, but does not directly mention disarmament or nuclear non-proliferation. It does not mention the Green Revolution or pan-Asian ideology. This leads to the conclusion that the most likely answer is:\n\nAnswer: (A) The formation of the non-aligned movement.\n\nStep 4: Account for Vagueness or Ambiguity\nThe passage mentions the need for Asia and Africa to mobilize their strength, but does not provide specific details about what this might mean. This leaves some ambiguity about the exact nature of the non-aligned movement and its activities. However, given the emphasis on preserving peace and the role of Asia and Africa in this effort, the answer remains (A) The formation of the non-aligned movement.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

While the passage mentions the development of gunpowder weapons in Europe and China, it does not specifically address how these societies shared their technologies or knowledge with each other. Therefore, this option does not closely relate to the argument in the passage.\n\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\nThis option refers to why European states eventually achieved military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era. The passage mentions that European governments invested in the development of gunpowder weapons, which eventually led to more powerful and easier to move weapons. However, it does not refer to the attainment of military superiority in the modern era or provide a reason for it. Therefore, this option does not closely relate to the argument in the passage.\n\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\nThis option refers to why Silk Road commerce dwindled across Eurasia after 1500 CE.

Germany was held responsible for the war and was accordingly punished by the treaty's provisions. These provisions were so harsh and humiliating that they gave rise to a sense among Germans that they had been unfairly treated and that the treaty was a \"Diktat\" (dictate) that threatened their survival. This widespread discontent and resentment provided fertile ground for the rise of the Nazi party, led by Adolf Hitler, who promised to overturn the treaty and restore Germany's power and prestige.\n\nSource 1 provides a quote from Hitler's speech to the Reichstag on September 1, 1939, where he condemns the Treaty of Versailles, calling it a \"Diktat\" that was imposed on Germany with \"pistols at our head\" and \"the threat of hunger for millions of people\". This statement reveals his belief that the treaty was coerced and thus invalid, a view that resonated with many Germans who resented the treaty's harsh conditions. The quote also reveals Hitler's rejection of peaceful revision of the treaty, a stance thatagogue was stoking.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) A widespread belief in Germany that it had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I, the historical background behind Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles mentioned in Source 1.",

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it.

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.
