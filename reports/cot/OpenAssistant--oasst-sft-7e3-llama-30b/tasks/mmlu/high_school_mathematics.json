We can start by listing the prime factorization of 1200, which is 2^2 x 3^1 x 5^1.\n- This means that n^2 must have at least one factor that is equal to 2, 3, or 5. We need to find all possible combinations of 2, 3, and 5 that add up to a positive integer.\n- There are five combinations: (1,1,3), (1,2,2), (1,3,1), (2,2,2), and (2,3,1). We need to check each combination to see which values of n^2 are factors of 1200.\n- For the combination (1,1,3), we can see that n=1 and 3 are both factors of 3. So, n^2 = 1 x 3 = 3, which is a factor of 1200. However, this combination has already been included in the other combinations, so we should not double count it.\n- Similarly, we can check the other combinations and see that the only unique combination that makes n^2 a factor of 1200 is (2,3,1), where n = 2 and 3 are both factors of 2, and 1 is a factor of 3. So, n^2 = 2 x 3= 6, which is a factor of 1200.\n- There are no other combinations that make n^2 a factor of 1200, so the sum of all positive integer values of n such that n^2 is a factor of 1200 is 6.\n- Answer: (D) 39\n\nNote: This problem will require some algebra and number theory, so it may be a bit challenging for some students.
