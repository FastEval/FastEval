            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The first part of the sentence refers to cryptocurrencies becoming increasingly mainstream, which implies they are more widely accepted and used.\n* The second part of the sentence mentions ethical implications associated with cryptocurrencies, including that they are expensive and secure.\n* The third part of the sentence states that they have been used to engage in financial crime.\n\nOption (A) is the only choice that accurately reflects the information given in the sentence. Option (B) is incorrect because it states that traditional currency is cheap and unsecure, which is generally not true. Option (C) is incorrect because it states that cryptocurrencies are cheap and secure, which is inconsistent with the information given in the sentence. Option (D) is incorrect because it states that traditional currency is expensive and unsecure, which is generally not true.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The question asks us to identify what \"______\" refers to in the sentence. Let's examine each option:\n\n(A) Employee rights: The phrase \"Employee rights\" appears twice in the options. This could be a trick to confuse us, but let's consider the sentence as a whole. The sentence mentions obligations of workers. Would employee rights refer to obligations of workers or the rights they have while working? It could refer to the latter.\n(B) Employee rights: Same as option (A).\n(C) Employer duties: If we consider the sentence again, it talks about obligations of workers. Obligations are tasks or duties someone is required to perform. If we replace the word \"duties\" in the options with \"obligations\", the sentence would read, \"Employer obligations are the obligations of workers towards their employer, based on individual contracts and wider employment laws.\" This phrasing seems odd. Would we say that workers have obligations towards their employer, or is it the other way around? It seems more logical to say that employers have obligations towards their workers. We can eliminate option (C).\n(D) Employee duties: Finally, let's consider option (D). The sentence talks about obligations of workers. If we replace the word \"duties\" in the options with \"obligations\", the sentence would read, \"Employee obligations are the obligations of workers towards their employer, based on individual contracts and wider employment laws.\" This phrasing seems logical. Employees have obligations towards their employer. Option (D) is the most appropriate answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) Employee duties",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The best answer among the available options is (B) Industrial ecosystems. The reasoning behind this choice is as follows:\n\n * The provided paragraph refers to interdependent organisms and their environments, which can be considered to be a balanced network. This definition matches the characteristics of ecosystems, which are commonly found in nature, such as forests or lakes.\n * However, the paragraph also mentions companies and industries which are not typically part of an ecosystem as it is traditionally defined. These are rather human-created systems that are not bound by biological or physical laws. Therefore, option (C) Ecological ecosystems cannot be the correct answer.\n * Instead, the text suggests to view industries and companies as an industrial ecosystem which is a network of interdependent components that operate together in a structured and organized manner in order to achieve a common goal. This is similar to an ecosystem where different organisms live in close relationship with each other and with their environment. Thus, the industrial ecosystem model provides a useful framework for understanding and improving the sustainability of human-made systems.\n* Option (B) Industrial ecosystems is therefore the most appropriate answer as it describes the relationship between companies, industries and their environment in a way that is similar to an ecosystem but takes into account the specific characteristics of human-made systems.\n* Answer: (B) Industrial ecosystems.",

            "model_answer": "A. Power imbalance, Benefits, Hoodwinked. This answer choice best describes the limitations and risks of business-CSO collaborations mentioned in the passage.\n\nFirstly, the passage mentions that one party may possess more resources than the other, creating a power imbalance (A). This unequal power dynamic can lead to unfair distribution of benefits (A), where one party gains more from the relationship than the other. Furthermore, the passage states that CSOs may be co-opted (A) and hoodwinked, which means deceived or tricked, possibly by businesses with more resources and power.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Hedonistic utilitarianism is a normative theory that prescribes the maximization of pleasure or happiness as the ultimate goal of an individual's actions. This theory suggests that actions that lead to the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people should be pursued.\n\nPreference utilitarianism is a normative theory that prescribes the maximization of preference satisfaction as the ultimate goal of an individual's actions. This theory suggests that actions that lead to the greatest satisfaction of the preferences of the greatest number of people should be pursued.\n\nThe Categorical Imperative is a normative theory put forward by Immanuel Kant that prescribes the treatment of all individuals as ends in themselves and never merely as means to an end. This theory suggests that actions should be taken based on whether they can be willed as a law for all rational beings.\n\nEthics of care is a normative theory that emphasizes the importance of relationships, responsibilities, and the value of care in moral decision-making. This theory suggests that actions should be taken with a focus on the well-being of others and the maintenance of relationships.\n\nCorporate profit maximization is most similar to preference utilitarianism in the sense that both theories focus on the maximization of a particular value. However, preference utilitarianism focuses on the maximization of preference satisfaction, while corporate profit maximization focuses on the maximization of financial profits.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) preference utilitarianism.",

He believed that corporate social responsibility and other initiatives aimed at benefiting society or other stakeholders were not the role of business. He believed that businesses should only follow the laws and regulations that govern them, but should not go beyond that in terms of social or environmental responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders.",

The second part of the question mentions that CSOs have \"interactions\" with businesses, which implies a two-way relationship. The first part of the question mentions that CSO regulation goes further than the \"legal\" instructions that CSOs have with businesses. This suggests that the first part is looking for a term that describes the rules or regulations that govern the CSO's activities, rather than the interactions between CSOs and businesses. The last part of the question mentions \"outcomes\" of such processes, which implies that the question is asking about the impact of the regulation or the interactions between CSOs and other actors.
