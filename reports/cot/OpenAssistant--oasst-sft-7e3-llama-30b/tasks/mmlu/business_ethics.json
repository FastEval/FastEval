            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand that corporate profit maximization is a normative principle in business ethics that suggests that companies should aim to maximize their profits. This principle can be controversial and debated, as it raises questions about the responsibility of corporations towards different stakeholders, such as employees, customers, suppliers, and shareholders.\n\nThe options presented in the question are different normative theories that can be compared to the principle of corporate profit maximization. Hedonistic utilitarianism and preference utilitarianism are both forms of consequentialism, which evaluate the morality of actions based on their outcomes and consequences. These theories focus on the happiness or preferences of individuals and aim to maximize overall well-being or utility.\n\nThe Categorical Imperative is a deontological theory proposed by Immanuel Kant. This theory posits that moral obligations are derived from universalizable principles that should be followed regardless of consequences. The ethics of care is another deontological theory that emphasizes the importance of relationships, caring, and responsibility towards others.\n\nCorporate profit maximization can be seen as similar to hedonistic utilitarianism and preference utilitarianism, as it aims to maximize outcomes or benefits for stakeholders. However, this principle is also controversial and may not align with the principles of deontological theories like the Categorical Imperative and the ethics of care.\n\nTherefore, (A) hedonistic utilitarianism and (B) preference utilitarianism are similar to corporate profit maximization, but (C) The Categorical Imperative and (D) ethics of care are not as they prioritize moral obligations and relationships over profit maximization.\n\nAnswer: (A) hedonistic utilitarianism and (B) preference utilitarianism are similar to corporate profit maximization, but (C) The Categorical Imperative and (D) ethics of care are not.
