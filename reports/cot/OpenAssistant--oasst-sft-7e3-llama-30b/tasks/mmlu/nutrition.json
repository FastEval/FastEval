            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "There are multiple reasons that contribute to the obesity epidemic.\n\n1. Increased energy quantity/density: The energy density of the food refers to the ratio of energy/calories present in a particular weight of food. Processed foods and drinks are often high in sugar and fat, making them high in calories but low in nutrients. Consuming such foods in excess can contribute to weight gain.\n2. More sedentary lifestyle: Human beings have evolved to move around physically while performing tasks like hunting and gathering food. With the advent of machines, transportation, and technology, the average person's physical activity levels have drastically reduced. Sedentary lifestyle makes it hard for people to burn off the excess energy, which eventually leads to obesity.\n3. Decreased leisure time activity: Sedentary screen time has increased, while structured leisure activities like playing, walking, or engaging in sports have reduced. This trend is seen across all age groups.\n4. Genetic factors: There is a link between certain genetic mutations, especially in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and obesity. Genetics play a modest role in obesity.\n\nAnswer: (A) Increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary life-style.",

            "model_answer": "This question is asking about which vitamin serves as a major lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes. It is important to consider the properties of each vitamin to determine which one fits this description.\n\n* Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is important for vision and skin health, among other functions. It is involved in the growth and differentiation of cells. It may have antioxidant effects, but it is not a major antioxidant in cell membranes.\n* Vitamin D is also a fat-soluble vitamin that is important for bone health and immune function. It can be synthesized by the body when exposed to sunlight. Vitamin D does have antioxidant properties, but it is not a major antioxidant in cell membranes.\n* Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from free radical damage. It is found in cell membranes and has been shown to have a variety of health benefits. It is a major lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes.\n* Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that is important for blood clotting and bone health. It does not have as clear of a role in antioxidant activity as the other vitamins do.\n\nThus, the answer is (C) Vitamin E.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "A. The answer is (A) Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor.\n\nReasoning:\n\n* Vitamin B12 helps maintain healthy nerve cells and red blood cells. As people age, their ability to absorb vitamin B12 from food decreases. This is because the stomach produces less acid as we age, which is necessary to free B12 from dietary proteins. Additionally, the stomach loses some of its cells that produce intrinsic factor, a protein that attaches to vitamin B12 in food and helps transport it through the intestines into the bloodstream.\n* Among the options listed, (A) Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor contributes to B12 deficiency by impairing B12 absorption. Intrinsic factor is critical for the absorption of B12, and reduced secretion contributes to B12 deficiency by impairing B12 absorption.\n* (B) Atrophic gastritis is an age-related condition that leads to a decrease in the production of stomach acid, which helps to free B12 from dietary proteins. The decrease in stomach acid can lead to reduced absorption of B12, which can result in B12 deficiency.\n* (C) Helicobacter pylori infection in the stomach can lead to atrophic gastritis, which, as mentioned in (B), can lead to decreased production of stomach acid and reduced B12 absorption.\n* (D) All of the above. The factors mentioned in (A), (B), and (C) are related and contribute to B12 deficiency in older adults in an interlinked manner. Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor, atrophic gastritis, and Helicobacter pylori infection can all play a role in B12 deficiency in older adults.\n\nAnswer: (A) Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor (not (B), (C), or (D)).",

            "model_answer": "(B) Vitamin D is required for calcium absorption from the small intestine.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n- Calcium is an essential mineral for bone health and other bodily functions.\n- The small intestine is the primary site of nutrient absorption in the body.\n- Vitamins are organic compounds that are essential for various physiological functions.\n- Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is well-known for its role in bone health, as it helps the body absorb calcium.\n- Vitamins A, E, and K are also involved in various physiological processes, but they are not primarily responsible for calcium absorption.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Vitamin D.",

This demand is met by a combination of dietary intake and endogenous production.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the metabolic demand for amino acids is not supplied only from the diet; the body also has endogenous mechanisms to produce some amino acids. Option (B) is incorrect because the metabolic demand for amino acids is not just to maintain protein turnover; it is required for various other functions as well. Option (D) is incorrect because the metabolic demand for amino acids is not a fixed amount; it varies depending on factors like age, gender, health status, and so on.\n\nThus, the correct answer is (C) The metabolic demand involves consumption of amino-acids by a number of irreversible pathways and these are either obligatory or adaptive.",
