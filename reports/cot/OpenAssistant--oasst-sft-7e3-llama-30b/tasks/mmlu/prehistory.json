            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Here is the step-by-step explanation for the given question:\n\n1. Locate keywords and phrases: The keywords and phrases in the question include \"Knossos,\" \"thought to have had,\" and \"over _______ rooms.\" These keywords suggest that the question is about the number of rooms at Knossos.\n2. Locate the answer choices: Answer choices are (A) 100, (B) 500, (C) 1,000, and (D) 5,000. The answer choices correspond to the number of rooms at Knossos.\n3. Review the information provided before choosing an answer: The prompt does not provide any information on exactly how many rooms are in the palace at Knossos or any information that can allow you to calculate that number with certainty.\n4. Rule out obviously incorrect answer choices: If exactly 5,000 rooms would be an impractical number for a palace, you can rule out answer choice (D) 5,000 as an obvious outlier. It could be easy to eliminate the other answer choices this way, but they all look plausible. Here, you can't eliminate any answer choice based on the criterion I mentioned.\n5. Make an educated guess based on a plausible range: If 100 rooms and 500 rooms both seem too small, and 1,000 rooms and 5,000 rooms too large, a plausible range for the number of rooms at the palace at Knossos might be between 500 and 1,000 rooms. Beware that this guess is not using any information beyond \"500 and 1,000 rooms seem reasonable\", so will often be wrong.\n6. Output the answer: Based on the reasoning explained above, the most plausible answer choice is (B) 500, which is close to the midpoint of the plausible range.\n7. Grade the question: I would grade the question a medium difficulty because the information provided before choosing an answer does not allow using anything beyond basic reasoning.\n\nIn the previous step Beware that this guess is not using any information beyond \"500 and 1,000 rooms seem reasonable\", so will often be wrong. exactly 5,000 rooms would be an impractica",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we will analyze each option and determine which element is absent from Hopewell culture.\n\n1. First, let's examine (A) formal government. The Hopewell culture did have some form of formal government, as indicated by the existence of a social hierarchy and the organization of public works projects.\n2. Next, let's consider (B) monumental earthworks. The Hopewell culture is known for its earthworks, such as the Mound City group in Ohio. These earthworks were indeed monumental and required a significant amount of planning and labor to construct.\n3. Moving on to (C) urban centers, we know that Hopewell settlements were not strictly urban. They were compromised of small settlements and not large densely populated cities.\n4. Lastly, let's evaluate (D) a permanent military. There is no evidence of a permanent military force in Hopewell culture.\n\nTherefore, the element that the Hopewell culture lacked is (D) a permanent military.\n\nAnswer: (D) a permanent military.",

We are asked to answer the following question: What are markings found on the mud-bricks of Huaca del Sol probably?\n2. The possible answers are (A) instructions for the builders written there by the engineers, (B) random scratches and not a meaningful script or written language, (C) intended to identify the local group that had produced them, and (D) simple arithmetic performed by carpenters on the building site.\n3. Let's evaluate each option to determine which is the most likely answer:\n\n(A) Instructions for the builders written there by the engineers seem like a reasonable possibility. If the engineers wanted to leave instructions for the builders, they might have written them directly on the mud-bricks.\n\n(B) Random scratches and not a meaningful script or written language is also a possibility. It's possible that the markings are just random scratches and not actually a written language.\n\n(C) Intended to identify the local group that had produced them is also a possibility. If the markings were used to identify the local group that produced the bricks, it would make sense that they would be on the bricks themselves.\n\n(D) Simple arithmetic performed by carpenters on the building site seems like the least likely option. It's possible that carpenters might have used the markings for some kind of arithmetic, but it seems less likely than the other options.\n\n4. Based on our evaluation of each option, the most likely answer is probably (A) instructions for the builders written there by the engineers.

            "model_answer": "Yes. A is correct. Here is my reasoning: \nThe C3 and C4 pathways are metabolic routes to carbon fixation, and are associated with types of plants. C3 plants are usually herbaceous and have broader growth temperature ranges, and C4 plants are usually grasses, sedges and succulents that have a narrower temperature range but more efficient water usage. When environments changed and led to shifts favoring C4 plants, the resulting decrease in C3 plants and fruit trees would have caused ancient hominids' diets to shift towards nuts and grasses, or simply types of food other than fruit. Thus, ancient hominids transitioned from a diet with species focused on grasses to nuts and fruits.",
