            "model_answer": "The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed by the United States Congress in August 1964 in response to a perceived attack on American naval forces by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin. This resolution authorized the President to take any necessary measures to defend US forces and prevent further attacks.\n\n(D) It curtailed US involvement in Vietnam is incorrect because the resolution actually authorized an escalation of US involvement in Vietnam by allowing the President to use military force without a formal declaration of war.\n\n(B) It illustrated the influence of public opinion on US foreign policy is incorrect because the resolution was passed by Congress, not public opinion. Public opinion did play a role in shaping the views of members of Congress, but it was not the primary factor in the passage of the resolution.\n\n(A) It allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam is also incorrect. While the resolution did authorize the President to take action to defend US forces and prevent further attacks, it did not necessarily require an intensification of US involvement. The President still had discretion to determine the level of military action.\n\n(C) It enhanced Congressional control over the Vietnam War is incorrect because the resolution did not give Congress any additional control over the war. In fact, it gave the President broad discretion to use military force and only required him to notify Congress rather than obtain their approval.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n(A) It allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam.\n\nThe Gulf of Tonkin resolution did indeed allow the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam by giving the President the authority to use military force to defend US forces and prevent further attacks. This resulted in an escalation of US military involvement in Vietnam in the years that followed.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The following are reasons to eliminate each option, one-by-one in a process of elimination.\n\n(A) Terrorists - (B) Organized crime\n\nTerrorists and organized crime are both nonstate actors, as neither is a nation. However, terrorists use acts of violence, threats of violence, and other means against civilians to coerce and intimidate governments for political or ideological aims. Organized crime, on the other hand, is involved in activities such as smuggling, theft, money laundering, and other illicit activities for financial gain.\n\n(B) Organized crime -  (C) Drug traffickers\n\nOrganized crime is more of a domestic threat, while drug trafficking is primarily an international threat. Organized crime engages in criminal activities such as racketeering, smuggling, money laundering, and sometimes even terrorist activities for financial gain. Drug traffickers, however, specialize in smuggling and selling illegal drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and marijuana for profit.\n\n(C) Drug traffickers - (D) China\n\nChina is a state actor and is not considered a threat in the same way that nonstate actors are. China is a communist nation-state that engages in various activities such as cyber warfare, espionage, intellectual property theft, and other activities that undermine American interests. While this is a concern, China is not comparable to drug traffickers who engage in illicit activities for financial gain.\n\nAnswer: (D) China",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The Cold War had both positive and negative impacts on American exceptionalism.\n\nAmerican exceptionalism is the idea that the United States is unique and superior to other nations. It is based on a set of beliefs about American history, values, and destiny.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the United States emerged as a superpower, with a dominant military and economic presence around the world. This was reflected in US foreign policy, which aimed to contain Soviet influence and prevent the spread of communism. In this sense, the Cold War enhanced American exceptionalism by confirming the country's status as the 'leader of the free world' (option B).\n\nHowever, the Cold War also had its challenges for American exceptionalism. The extension of American power globally meant that some of the core assumptions of exceptionalism were questioned. For example, the need to engage with other countries and work within international institutions, such as the United Nations, challenged the idea that America could act unilaterally and set its own rules without any consequences (option C).\n\nIn conclusion, both options B and C are correct, and therefore option D is the best answer.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) All of the above.\n\nReasoning:\n\n* Franklin D. Roosevelt initially favoured an 'isolationist' stance on the part of the US during the 1930s for a variety of reasons.\n* One reason was his belief that internal reform rather than international negotiation was the key to economic regeneration of the US. Many Americans, especially in the Midwest, were worried about foreign competition, immigration, and political radicalism. Roosevelt believed that the US should focus on its own recovery and not get bogged down in international entanglements.\n* Another reason was his belief that German domination of Europe would be in US interests. Roosevelt, like many other Americans, was persuaded by Hitler's claim that he sought to restore Germany as a great power but would pose no threat to the United States. Roosevelt believed that a strong Germany would serve as a bulwark against communism and help preserve the balance of power in Europe.\n* Finally, Franklin D. Roosevelt's initial isolationist stance was also influenced by domestic politics. He was facing strong political opposition from isolationist groups, such as the America First Committee, and he did not want to appear too interventionist and risk losing political support.\n\nAnswer: (D) All of the above.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(D) Increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making.\n\nThe 'New Populism' refers to a trend in foreign policy making in which public opinion is given more consideration than before. This can be seen as a response to the increasing impact of globalization and the rise of social media, which have made it easier for the public to voice their opinions and concerns. As a result, political leaders and policymakers have had to take these opinions into account when making foreign policy decisions. This is in contrast to traditional approaches to foreign policy making, which tended to prioritize the interests of elites and political insiders.",

            "model_answer": "(D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* World War I was a global conflict that involved many of the world's major powers.\n* During the war, the United States remained neutral for a time, but ultimately entered the conflict on the side of the Allied Powers.\n* The United States economy was relatively unaffected by the war during its early years, but as the conflict dragged on, it began to have a greater impact.\n* As European countries spent large amounts of money on the war effort, they began to heavily rely on American credit to finance their war bonds.\n* The United States, therefore, became a creditor country, as European countries owed it large sums of money.\n* At the same time, the United States also became a financial centre, as it was the primary source of financing for the war effort.\n* After the war, the United States took steps to collect on these debts, further increasing its economic power.\n* Overall, World War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States by making the United States a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy.",
