Johnson the authority to use military force in Vietnam without a formal declaration of war. The resolution was in response to the alleged attack on two US Navy destroyers by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin. The incident was used as justification for escalating US involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nThe resolution provided the legal framework for the US to increase its military presence in Vietnam, including the deployment of ground troops. It also marked a significant expansion of the president's war powers, which had major implications for the course of the Vietnam War and US foreign policy more broadly.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is the correct answer, which allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam.",

This narrows the options to Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter as the only two Democrats who visited China, with the other two options being Republicans.\n\nNext, we look for the first Democrat on the list, narrowing the options down to Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter.\n\nFinally, we look at the respective order of these two Democrats assuming the question intends the phrase 'first American president to visit communist China' to mean the first president to do so during their time in office:\n\n* Richard Nixon visited China in 1972. But 1972 is after both Lyndon Johnson (1963-1969) and Jimmy Carter (1977-1981), reducing the options to Jimmy Carter, who is the 'first American president to visit communist China' out of those two Democrats on the list.\n* Therefore, the answer is (D) Jimmy Carter.\n\n(*) Note that 'first American president to visit communist China' can also have a less strict interpretation of 'first American president to visit China,' which could also include George H.

American exceptionalism refers to the belief that the United States is distinct and exceptional among nations, and that it has a special role to play in world history.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the United States adopted a policy of containment, aimed at stopping the spread of communism around the world. This policy had a profound impact on American exceptionalism, and there are several ways in which it can be analyzed.\n\nOne way to approach this question is to examine the effect of the Cold War on the status of the United States as a global leader. Prior to the Cold War, the United States had emerged as a rising power, with a strong economy and a commitment to democracy and freedom. The Cold War gave the United States an opportunity to establish itself as a global leader, and many Americans believed that their country had a moral obligation to lead the world and defend democracy against the spread of communism.\n\n(B) Exceptionalism was enhanced by America's status as the 'leader of the free world'",

He viewed international negotiations as a distraction from this focus on internal reforms.\n\n(B) He believed that German domination of Europe would be in US interests.\n\nFDR did not believe that German domination of Europe was a desirable outcome. In fact, he was deeply concerned about the rise of Nazism and its threat to democracy and the international order. He believed that the US should play a role in opposing fascism and supporting democracy, and he advocated for increased support for the Allies, especially in the later years of the decade.\n\n(C) He always favoured isolationism.\n\nThis is not entirely accurate.

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyze the question and identify the key information. In this case, the question asks about how World War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States, and lists four potential causes (A) to (D).\n\nStep 2: Consider each option (A) to (D) in turn and think about whether it is consistent with the information in the question. For example, option (A) suggests that the war reduced European population levels, but could that really explain why economic power shifted to the United States? Similarly, option (B) suggests that the United States seized German resources, but could that explain why economic power shifted from Europe as a whole? Option (C) suggests that European countries paid the United States for assistance, but would that explain why economic power shifted to the United States? Option (D) suggests that the United States became a financial centre, but could that explain why economic power shifted from Europe?\n\nStep 3: Use your knowledge and reasoning to identify the correct answer. In this case, (D) is the correct answer, because the United States became a creditor country and financial centre as a result of European war spending. The United States economy was boosted by this spending, which allowed it to emerge as a creditor country and financial centre. This process helped to shift economic power from Europe to the United States.\n\nStep 4: Provide the answer as a single letter in parentheses. In this case, the answer is (D).",
