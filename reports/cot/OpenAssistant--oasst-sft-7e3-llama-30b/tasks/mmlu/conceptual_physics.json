In this case, the angle of incidence is 20 degrees, which is greater than the critical angle of water, so the light ray totally internally reflects and does not enter the air above.\n\nAnswer: A (total internal reflection)",

It works by winding the primary coil with fewer turns than the secondary coil, creating a step-up in the voltage ratio.\n\nThe primary voltage is stepped up to a higher value before it is sent to the secondary load. This allows for a more efficient transmission of electricity over long distances and facilitates the use of lower voltage devices in the load circuits.\n\nTherefore, both voltage and energy are stepped up by a step-up transformer.",
