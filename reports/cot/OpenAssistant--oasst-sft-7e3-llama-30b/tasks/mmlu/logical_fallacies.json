            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) classifies subjects.\n\nHere is the reasoning behind the answer step-by-step:\n\n1. Disjunctive syllogism is a type of deductive argument that has two disjuncts (alternatives) and a conclusion that follows from one of the disjuncts being true.\n2. A valid disjunctive syllogism has a major premise that lays out the two alternatives, which are usually expressed as \"either A or B\" or \"not both A and B\".\n3. The major premise does not necessarily affirm or deny any antecedent or consequent, so option (C) is not correct.\n4. The major premise does not lead to a valid conclusion by itself, as the conclusion follows from one of the disjuncts being true. So, option (D) is also not correct.\n5. The major premise of a valid disjunctive syllogism classifies the subjects (i.e. it tells us which members of a class belong to which alternative). So, option (B) is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: B.",

            "model_answer": "First, let's define the fallacy of style over substance. This fallacy occurs when an argument or claim is accepted as true or rejected as false based on the way it is presented, rather than on the actual content or evidence supporting it.\n\nNow, let's consider the given options and determine which one best describes this fallacy.\n\n(A) Changing the meaning of a word or phrase from one part of the argument to another may be a fallacy called equivocation, where the speaker uses a word or phrase in a different way than what it ordinarily means. This does not necessarily imply that the argument is accepted or rejected based on style.\n\n(B) Confusing figurative language with literal language is a fallacy called false analogy, where a comparison is made between two things that are not similar in the ways being compared. However, again, this may not necessarily imply that the argument is accepted or rejected based on style.\n\n(C) Reasoning that ideas presented in an appealing manner are correct, regardless of the content of the message, is the fallacy of style over substance. This option describes the central idea behind the fallacy, where the presentation or packaging of an argument is taken to be more important than the actual content or evidence supporting it.\n\n(D) Using emotionally charged language to create an impression about the subject of a claim, without making an argument that the language fits the subject, is a fallacy called appeal to emotion. This fallacy may be related to the fallacy of style over substance, but it is not the same thing.\n\nTherefore, option (C) is the best description of the fallacy of style over substance.\n\nAnswer: (C)",
