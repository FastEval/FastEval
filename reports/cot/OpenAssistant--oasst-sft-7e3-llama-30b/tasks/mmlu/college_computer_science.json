It involves creating a matrix that lists all the processes and all the resources, and indicating the access rights of each process to each resource. The matrix can become large and cumbersome to manage as the number of processes and resources increases, and it may not be able to express complex protection requirements. The matrix must also be able to decide whether a given process has access to a particular resource, and this can be a difficult task in some cases. Finally, the matrix must have a way to specify who has the rights to change the access matrix itself.\n\nBased on the above explanation, the answer is: D) there is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself.",

To find the set of all common divisors of two integers, we need to identify the set of integers that can be divisors of two integers. Let's define a set D containing all divisors of integers. Consider an integer n. The positive divisors of n can be expressed as 1, 2, 3, ..., n. Similarly, the negative divisors of n can be expressed as -1, -2, -3, ..., -n. Therefore, the set D would contain all integers from -n to n, inclusive.\n2. Since the set of common divisors of two integers x and y is the intersection of the set of divisors of x and the set of divisors of y, we need to find the intersection of two sets containing all divisors. Let's call the sets containing all divisors of x and y as D(x) and D(y), respectively.\n3. The common divisors of x and y would be the set of all integers that are in both D(x) and D(y). Since D(x) and D(y) contain all divisors of x and y, respectively, the set of common divisors of x and y would contain all integers that can divide both x and y. Consider an integer n in the set of common divisors. This would mean that n can divide both x and y. Therefore, the set of all common divisors of two integers x and y can be expressed as:\n\nset of all common divisors = {n | n is an integer and n can divide both x and y}\n\n4.

Floating-point arithmetic is not inherently nonassociative for this reason.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Floating-point arithmetic is a way of representing and performing calculations on real numbers using a finite number of bits to represent each number. Because of the finite precision of the representation, there can be some non-associativity in the calculations.\n* Nonassociativity refers to the fact that the order in which operations are performed can affect the result. In other words, the expression (a * b) * c may not be equal to a * (b * c) for certain values of a, b, and c.\n* One reason why nonassociativity can occur is that some numbers have no exact representation in floating-point arithmetic. For example, 1/3 is not representable exactly in binary floating-point, so the expression 0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 might not be exactly equal to 0.001.\n* Another reason why nonassociativity can occur is that there have to be upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers that can be represented. This can lead to rounding errors and non-equivalence of expressions involving very large or very small numbers.\n* However, these sources of nonassociativity can be minimized or eliminated by choosing appropriate rounding conventions and handling very small or very large numbers with special care.\n* Therefore, while floating-point arithmetic is not perfectly associative, it is generally possible to achieve associativity to a very good approximation with appropriate care.\n\nAnswer: (A) It is inherently nonassociative because some numbers have no exact representation.",
