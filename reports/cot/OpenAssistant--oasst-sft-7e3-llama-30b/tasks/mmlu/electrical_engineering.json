            "model_answer": "(D) 60\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 is the range of firing angle control. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The problem states that a single-phase one pulse-controlled circuit has resistance R and a load counter-emf E = 200 sin(314t).\n2. In a single-phase one pulse-controlled circuit, the firing angle control determines when the thyristor should turn on to conduct the sinusoidal output voltage from the source.\n3. The range of the firing angle control determines the output voltage that can be generated by the circuit. For example, a firing angle of 30 degrees would generate a lower output voltage than a firing angle of 180 degrees.\n4. The problem does not provide information about the value of R or the load current, so it is not possible to determine the exact output voltage or power delivered to the load.\n5. However, based on the given information, the firing angle control can range from 60 degrees to 180 degrees in order to conduct the sinusoidal output voltage from the source. This range of firing angles allows the thyristor to conduct the output voltage across the entire half cycle of the sinusoidal waveform, from 60 degrees to 180 degrees.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 60\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.",

            "model_answer": "Let us analyze the given options:\n\nOption A: same as that produced by one plate.\n\nExplanation: If the two plates carry equal and opposite surface charge densities, the field between them will cancel out, resulting in zero field in the gap between the plates. So this option cannot be correct.\n\nOption B: double the field produced by one plate.\n\nExplanation: If we consider one plate alone, the surface charge density will produce an electric field perpendicular to the plate. If we place another plate next to it with the same surface charge density, the field lines from the first plate will be blocked by the second plate, and the field between the plates will be largely confined to the gap between them. So the field between the plates will be more concentrated and stronger than the field from one plate alone. Thus, option B could be correct.\n\nOption C: dependent on coordinates of field points.\n\nExplanation: The field between two infinite parallel metal plates carrying equal and opposite surface charges will depend on the coordinates of the field points. The field is strongest at the center of the gap and falls off toward the edges of the plates. So option C is also possibly correct.\n\nOption D: zero.\n\nExplanation: If the two plates carry equal and opposite surface charge densities, they will cancel each other's fields, resulting in zero field in the gap between the plates.

Since the question asks for the frequency range, the answer would be a selection of (A), (B), (C), or (D) that correctly describes the range.\n\nStep 1: Start with Option (B) as the first possible answer.\n\nStep 2: Since the frequency range of an LC oscillator can cover a wide range of values, we should investigate the specific properties of the components to determine a more precise range.\n\nStep 3: Inductors typically have a maximum operating frequency, which is determined by the properties of the magnetic material it is made of and the physical size of the coil. Capacitors, on the other hand, have a minimum operating frequency, which depends on the capacitance value. These factors can influence the upper and lower bounds of the frequency range.\n\nStep 4: Consider the typical values of inductors and capacitors in an LC oscillator circuit. Inductors in the range of a few microhenries to a few millihenries are commonly used, while capacitors can range from picofarads to microfarads. Similarly, the frequency range of an LC oscillator can cover a wide range of values, depending on the values of L and C used in the circuit.\n\nStep 5: Consider the given frequency range options again. Option (B) implies a range of 100 KHz to 500 MHz, which could be within the typical range of an LC oscillator. Option (A) implies a range of 1 MHz to 500 MHz, which may be too high for many LC oscillators. Option (C) implies a range of 1 KHz to 1 MHz, which may be too low for many LC oscillators. Option (D) implies a range of 1 MHz to 100 GHz, which is extremely high and may be beyond the range of typical LC oscillators.\n\nStep 6: Based on the reasoning above, the answer is Option (B) 100 KHz to 500 MHz.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n\\item (B) 100 KHz to 500 MHz",
