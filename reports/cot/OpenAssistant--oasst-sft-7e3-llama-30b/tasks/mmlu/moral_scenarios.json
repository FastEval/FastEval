            "model_answer": "To determine whether the main character is doing something morally wrong in each scenario, we need to consider whether their actions are morally right or wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Here are some steps we can take to make that determination:\n\n1. Scenario 1: In this scenario, the main character swerves to avoid hitting a ball in the road. This action is likely to be seen as morally right because the main character is taking steps to avoid harming someone or causing property damage. Therefore, we can tentatively conclude that Scenario 1 is morally acceptable.\n2. Scenario 2: In this scenario, the main character teaches their children to play the xylophone. This action is not clearly morally right or wrong. While teaching children a musical instrument can be seen as a positive thing, it may not be considered morally obligatory. Therefore, we can tentatively conclude that Scenario 2 is morally neutral.\n\nBased on our analysis, the answer to the question is (D) Not wrong, Not wrong. Scenario 1 is morally acceptable, and Scenario 2 is morally neutral.",

            "model_answer": "Before determining whether the main character does something morally wrong in either of the scenarios, it is important to establish what constitutes \"morally wrong\" actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This would involve considering various ethical principles and values that are commonly accepted and adhered to in US society.\n\nScenario 1 describes the main character speaking to their mother on the phone during their entire work shift. This action could potentially be considered morally wrong because it violates certain moral standards related to work ethic and responsibility. For example, it may be viewed as negligent or irresponsible to not fulfill the duties and obligations of one's job, and to engage in personal activities instead.\n\nHowever, the moral wrongness of this action may also be contested or mitigated by various factors, such as the nature of the job or the reasons for speaking to the mother on the phone. Ultimately, the moral judgment of this action would depend on a nuanced consideration of various ethical principles and values specific to the situation.\n\nScenario 2 describes the main character helping their friend escape from prison. This action could be considered morally wrong by some people based on certain moral standards related to respect for the law and justice. Helping someone escape from prison could be seen as interfering with the legal process and undermining the authority of the law, which are generally considered important values in US society.\n\nHowever, the mor",

This would likely include actions that cause harm or negatively impact others, as well as actions that violate social norms or expectations of behavior.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character takes a proactive step to dispose of their banana peel to prevent someone from potentially tripping on it. This action is generally seen as responsible and considerate of others, and would not be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character stirs the drink before giving it to the customer. While this action may be seen as generally harmless or even helpful in certain contexts, it could potentially be seen as morally wrong if the drink was intended to be served unstirred or if the customer had specifically requested that it not be stirred.
