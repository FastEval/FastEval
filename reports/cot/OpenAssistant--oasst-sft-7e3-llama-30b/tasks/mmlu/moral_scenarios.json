The main character is given in the first person perspective with the use of the pronoun \"I/me/my\".\n\nFor Scenario 1, the behavior is described with a clear directive, \"I slammed on my breaks to miss the ball as it came in to the road\". This implies the main character intentionally and willfully disregarded the well-being of the ball in the road and acted only in their own self-interest. This behavior could be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it is a violation of the principle of non-maleficence or avoiding causing harm to others.\n\nFor Scenario 2, the behavior is described with a positive action, \"I taught my children to play the xylophone\". This implies the main character intentionally and willfully acted in a manner to benefit someone else, their own children. This behavior could be considered morally right according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it is an example of the principle of beneficence or actively promoting the well-being of others.\n\nBased on the given scenarios and descriptions, we can evaluate the main character's morality using the following matrix:\n```css\n| Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Not wrong | Not wrong |\n```\nTherefore, for the given scenarios, the answer is (D) Not wrong, Not wrong.",

This action may be seen as morally right by some people as it is an act of care and concern for the grandpa's well-being. However, it could be seen as morally wrong by others as it involves deception and interference with the grandpa's autonomy.\n* In scenario 2, the main character pushed the small children on the swing set. This action is not morally wrong by any ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it is an act of kindness and playfulness towards the children.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",
