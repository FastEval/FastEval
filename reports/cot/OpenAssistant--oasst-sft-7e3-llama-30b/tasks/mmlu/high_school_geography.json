            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking about the main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically. To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the characteristics of a subsistence economy and the factors that are necessary for economic advancement.\n\nA subsistence economy is an economy in which people produce just enough goods to sustain themselves and their families. They do not produce anything beyond what is needed for their own consumption.\n\nFor an economy to advance, it needs to have a stable and well-functioning financial system that facilitates the exchange of goods and services. It also needs access to markets and a means of transporting goods to those markets.\n\nBased on this analysis, the main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically is:\n\n(D) a banking service. Subsistence economies typically lack access to financial services such as banks, which makes it difficult for people to save, invest, and borrow money. This limits their ability to expand their businesses and increase their productivity, which in turn limits their ability to advance economically.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The will help you to understand the concept of demographic momentum.\n\nA) Zero population growth is when the birth rate is equal to the death rate, resulting in a stable population. However, in the case of demographic momentum, the population continues to grow even after the replacement fertility rate has been achieved.\n\nB) Rapid growth rate refers to a population growing at a fast pace. However, demographic momentum is not about the rate of growth but rather the continued growth of a population even after replacement fertility has been achieved.\n\nC) Homeostatic plateau refers to a state of equilibrium in a population, where the birth rate is equal to the death rate, resulting in a stable population. Demographic momentum is not about a stable population but rather the continued growth of a population even after replacement fertility has been achieved.\n\nD) Demographic momentum is a term used to describe the tendency for a population to continue to grow long after replacement fertility has been achieved. Achieving replacement fertility means that the average woman is having just enough children to replace herself and her partner, resulting in a stable population. However, due to the continuing growth of a population at this stage, it leads to a demographic momentum.",

            "question": "The tendency for migration to decrease with distance is called\n\n(A) push factors.\n(B) pull factors.\n(C) distance decay.\n(D) migration selectivity.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Answer: (C) distance decay.\n\nReasoning:\n\n* The question asks which of the following is the term for the tendency of migration to decrease with distance.\n* The options are (A) push factors, (B) pull factors, (C) distance decay, and (D) migration selectivity.\n* Push factors and pull factors are commonly used terms in migration studies, and refer to various factors that influence the decision to migrate. Push factors refer to factors that motivate individuals to leave a place, such as a lack of economic opportunity or political instability. Pull factors refer to factors that attract individuals to a certain location, such as employment opportunities or better weather. Therefore, (A) push factors and (B) pull factors are not the correct answer for the given question.\n* Migration selectivity refers to the process by which individuals select certain destinations over others. It is closely related to push and pull factors, but refers specifically to the decision-making process of choosing a destination. Therefore, (D) migration selectivity is not the correct answer either.\n* The remaining option, (C) distance decay, is the tendency for migration to decrease over distance. It is based on the idea that the stronger the connections between two locations, the more likely it is that people will move between them. As distance increases, these connections weaken and migration decreases. Therefore, (C) distance decay is the correct answer.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Answer: (C) Third.\n\nBurgess's concentric zone model of urban form consists of five zones that he believed existed in every city, causing them to concentrate in a particular order based on their functions. The zones are:\n\n(A) First: The Central Business District (CBD) - This zone is characterized by commercial activities, such as office buildings, department stores, and hotels.\n\n(B) Second: The Residence for the Working Class - This zone is characterized by the homes of working-class individuals who work in the CBD. It is also called the \" Zwischenstadt \" or \"in-between-city,\" as it is located between the CBD and the factory area.\n\n(C) Third: The Area of Middle-Class Residence - This zone is characterized by moderate-income homes, converted into tenements and other forms of low-income housing. It also contains ethnic ghettos and experiences general deterioration.\n\n(D) Fourth: The Factory Area (or \"Plant District\") - This zone is characterized by industries and factories.\n\n(E) Fifth: The Residential Area for the Working Class - This zone is characterized by the homes of workers who are employed in the factories in the factory area.\n\nTherefore, according to Burgess's concentric zone model, the zone that contains low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration is the Third Zone: the Area of Middle-Class Residence.\n\nFinal answer: (C) Third.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct statement is (D) Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), women make up a considerable proportion of the world's labor force.\n2. However, women's participation in the labor force varies greatly by region and country.\n3. In some parts of the world, such as Africa and South Asia, agriculture is one of the primary sources of employment for women. Hence, statement (A) is not correct, as most women do not work in agriculture worldwide.\n4. The percentage of women economically active in the labor force has actually increased in many parts of the world over the years, which contradicts statement (B).\n5. Women's share of the total labor force has also increased in many countries and regions over the years, which contradicts statement (C) as well.\n6. However, studies show that, on average, women work more hours per day than men in most regions of the world, with the exception of Anglo America and Australia. This is because women often have to balance work with household and care responsibilities, which leads to longer workdays. Hence, statement (D) is the correct answer.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The form of migration that farm workers from another country are most likely to be practicing during the year is (C) Circular migration.\n\nThis is because circular migration refers to the movement of people from one place to another and back again in a circular pattern, often for a specific period of time. In the case of farm workers from another country, they may travel to a country where there is a demand for seasonal farm work, work for a set period of time, and then return to their home country. This form of migration allows individuals to find temporary work in a different location while maintaining a connection to their home community. Chain migration refers to the process of immigration where\nindividuals follow a chain of previous migrants from their community. This may not be the case for seasonal farm workers. Cluster migration is the tendency for immigrants from the same geographic area to settle together in a particular neighborhood in the destination country. This may not be the case for farm workers who are moving in for work. International migration is the movement of people from one country to another and can describe any of the above forms of migration but it is too broad to specifically describe the migration pattern of seasonal farm workers.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is A.\nInitial reasoning: Early settlements and population density near coastlines and rivers can be attributed to ease of access to water for various purposes such as drinking, irrigation, transportation, and fishing. This can be a crucial factor in supporting human settlement and dense population.\n\nNext steps: Check the options and see which one aligns with the reasoning. Option A, Mediterranean climate, suggests moderate temperatures and rainfall, which may not directly relate to the ease of access to water. Option B, Limited forest cover, suggests that population may settle in areas with less tree cover, but this does not directly explain the preference for coastal and riverine areas. Option C, Growth of manufacturing, suggests that population may settle near sources of raw materials or markets, but this does not explain the preference for coastal and riverine areas. Option D, Access to trade routes, suggests that population may settle near transportation routes for trade purposes, but this does not directly relate to the ease of access to water.\n\nAnswer: Option A is not the correct answer as it does not align with the initial reasoning. Options B, C, and D do not align with the reasoning either. Therefore, there is no correct answer among the given options.",
