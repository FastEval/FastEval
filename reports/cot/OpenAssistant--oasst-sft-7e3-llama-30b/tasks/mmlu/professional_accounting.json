            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The first step is to calculate the daily revenue from renting the limousine. We know the rental cost per hour, which is $245, and the number of hours the car will be rented per day, which is 2. Therefore, the daily revenue is:\n\nDaily revenue = Rental cost per hour x Number of hours rented per day\nDaily revenue = $245 x 2\nDaily revenue = $490\n\nNext, we need to calculate the daily profit from renting the limousine. We know the daily revenue and the daily costs, which is estimated to be $50. Therefore, the daily profit is:\n\nDaily profit = Daily revenue - Daily costs\nDaily profit = $490 - $50\nDaily profit = $440\n\nNow we need to calculate the yearly revenue from renting the limousine. We know the daily revenue and the number of days in a year, which is 365. Therefore, the yearly revenue is:\n\nYearly revenue = Daily revenue x Number of days in a year\nYearly revenue = $490 x 365\nYearly revenue = $184,150\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the estimated yearly yield on the investment. We know the yearly revenue and the initial investment, which was $98,000. Therefore, the estimated yearly yield on the investment is:\n\nYearly yield = Yearly revenue - Initial investment\nYearly yield = $184,150 - $98,000\nYearly yield = $86,150\n\nThe answer is (D) 183%.",

            "model_answer": "(A) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\nThis statement is correct because it clearly explains the concept of nonsampling risks in audit sampling. Nonsampling risks arise from the possibility that the auditor might not be able to reach the same conclusions by testing a sample of items as compared to testing every item in the population. This is because a sample is only a representation of the entire population, and there is always a possibility that the sample might not be representative of the entire population. Therefore, nonsampling risks are an inherent risk in audit sampling that the auditor must consider in order to minimize the risk of reaching incorrect conclusions.",

            "model_answer": "First, we need to determine the present value of the cash inflows in years 5 and 10. We can use the formula for present value of a single future cash flow to discount the cash inflows back to their present values:\n\nPV = FV / (1 + r)^n\n\nwhere PV is the present value, FV is the future value, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of periods.\n\nFor the cash inflow in year 5, we have:\n\nPV = $500 / (1 + 0.1)^5 = $358.35\n\nFor the cash inflow in year 10, we have:\n\nPV = $500 / (1 + 0.1)^10 = $226.36\n\nNext, we need to subtract the initial investment of $500 to find the NPV. We can do this by subtracting the present value of the cash inflows from the initial investment:\n\nNPV = $500 - ($358.35 + $226.36) = -$219.35\n\nTherefore, the NPV of the investment project is -$219.35, which is choice (B).",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First we need to understand that the issue here is that the company, Dean Co., used the straight-line method to amortize the premium on the bonds they issued, instead of the effective interest method. This means that the expense of the premium was not properly allocated over the life of the bond, which can affect the carrying value of the bond, as well as the retained earnings and overall earnings of the company.\n\nTo determine the affect on the Bond carrying amount, Retained earnings and overall earnings, we need to consider how the straight-line method of amortization affects the total interest expense over the life of the bond.\n\nUnder the straight-line method, the premium is amortized evenly over the life of the bond, resulting in a higher interest expense in the early years and a lower interest expense in the later years, than the effective interest method.\n\nTherefore, at June 30 year 12, the Bond carrying amount will be Overstated, because the straight-line method overstates the interest expense in the early years and understates the interest expense in the later years, resulting in a higher premium being allocated to the early years and a lower premium being allocated to the later years.\n\nThe Retained earnings will also be Understated, because the interest expense is overstated in the early years and understated in the later years, resulting in less earnings being retained in the earlier years and more earnings being retained in the later years.\n\nSince the Error affects the Bond carrying amount and Retained earnings, it will affect the overall earnings, and the answer for the overall earnings is also Understated (B) .\n\n(A) is incorrect because while the Bond carrying amount is overstated, the Retained earnings are understated.\n(C) is incorrect because while the Bond carrying amount is overstated, Retained earnings are also affected. (D) is incorrect because both the Bond carrying amount and Retained earnings are affected by the error",

During a tax year, the corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income and distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders. Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson\u2019s individual tax return.

            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, we are trying to determine how much income Carson would have reported on his individual tax return if the C corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate to their ownership interests.\n\nThe first step is to determine Carson's proportionate share of the $400,000 in taxable income generated by the C corporation. We know that Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock, so his proportionate share of the taxable income would be 40%.\n\nNext, we need to determine the total amount of cash dividends distributed to the shareholders. We are told that the corporation distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends, but we do not know how much of that amount was paid to Carson specifically.\n\nHowever, we do know that if the corporation had been an S corporation, the distributions to the owners would have been proportionate to their ownership interests. Since Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock, his proportionate share of the cash dividends would also be 40%.\n\nTherefore, we can determine that Carson received $70,000 x 40% = $28,000 in cash dividends. We are asked to find the amount of income that Carson would have reported on his individual tax return, and since the cash dividends are included in gross income, we can add the $28,000 in cash dividends to Carson's other gross income.\n\nThe question does not provide any information about Carson's other gross income, so we cannot determine the total amount of income that he would have reported on his individual tax return. The answer is therefore (E) None of the above.",
