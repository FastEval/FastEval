            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(C) Understated No effect\n\nExplanation:\n\n* When a company makes a credit purchase of merchandise, it increases the amount of inventory on hand and decreases the amount of cash on hand.\n* In this case, the purchase was not recorded, which means that the inventory was included in the year-end physical inventory but the cash was not decreased.\n* This has the effect of overstating the inventory on the balance sheet and understating the cash on hand.\n* While not recording the purchase will not have an effect on the liabilities of the company, it will affect the assets of the company.\n* The correct answer is (C) Understated No effect.",

            "model_answer": "A) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population. (Correct answer)\n\nExplanation:\n\nAfter reading the given statements, I can say that (A) is the correct answer. This is because (A) correctly identifies the meaning of the nonsampling risk in audit sampling which refers to the possibility of different conclusions if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\nNonsampling risk arises due to the fact that when the auditor tests only a sample of the items instead of testing every item in the population, there is a possibility that the sample results may not represent the entire population. Thus the conclusion drawn from the sample may not be accurate which could lead to different conclusions if all the items were tested.\n\n(B) states the fact that nonsampling risk can arise due to the failure to recognize misstatements. But the question asked about the correct statement of the nonsampling risk.\n\n(C) and (D) are the examples of sampling risks which are different from the nonsampling risk.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is (A).",

These are documents that provide guidance on new accounting pronouncements, modify existing guidance, or offer other improvements to GAAP.\n* The FASB usually issues ASUs in response to feedback from stakeholders, changes in the business environment, or other factors that suggest the need for improvements to GAAP.\n* The other options listed in the question are not correct.

We can use the formula for NPV:\n\nNPV = Profit in year 5 / (1 + discount rate) ^ 5 + Profit in year 10 / (1 + discount rate) ^ 10\n\nLet's first calculate the profit in year 5:\n\nProfit in year 5 = $500 + (discount rate * 5)\nProfit in year 5 = $500 + 10% * 5\nProfit in year 5 = $500 + $50\nProfit in year 5 = $550\n\nNext, we'll calculate the profit in year 10:\n\nProfit in year 10 = $500 + (discount rate * 10)\nProfit in year 10 = $500 + 10% * 10\nProfit in year 10 = $500 + $100\nProfit in year 10 = $600\n\nNow we can calculate the NPV:\n\nNPV = $550 / (1 + 10%) ^ 5 + $600 / (1 + 10%) ^ 10\nNPV = $550 / 1.6259 + $600 / 1.8199\nNPV = $337.656 + $327.639\nNPV = $665.295\n\nSo the NPV of the investment project is $665.295, which means that it is a profitable investment.\n\nThe answer is (D) $500.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First, let's understand the straight-line method and the effective interest method.\n\nIn the straight-line method, the cost of a bond is allocated evenly over its life to the interest expense account each period. This results in a constant interest expense each period until the bond matures.\n\nIn contrast, the effective interest method allocates interest expense based on the effective interest rate, which takes into account the effective yield and the interest compounding periods. The effective interest rate results in a declining interest expense over the life of the bond, since the interest expense in later periods is lower than that of earlier periods, due to the interest compounding effect.\n\nNow let's consider the premium on the bond. The premium represents the additional amount paid for the bond over its face value, which results in additional interest expense in the early periods of the bond's life.\n\nA premium on a bond can be amortized using either method, but the effective interest method allocates the premium in a way that more accurately reflects the interest expense and the interest compounding effect.\n\nNow let's consider the question. Dean Co. incorrectly used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the premium on the bond. As a result, the interest expense in later periods would be understated and the carrying value of the bond at June 30 year 12 would be understated.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Understated Overstated. The retained earnings would also be understated since the interest expense was understated.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) It will be classified as a current asset.\n\nReasoning:\n\n* The old building is being actively marketed for sale, which means the company intends to sell it in the near future.\n* Asset held for sale is a category of assets in the balance sheet that includes properties, plant, and equipment that are intended to be sold rather than used in operations. The company should classify the old building as an asset held for sale once it meets certain criteria, such as being available for immediate sale, being actively marketed, and having a reasonable expectation of being sold within one year.\n* Once classified as an asset held for sale, the old building would be separately disclosed on the balance sheet and would no longer be depreciated.\n* The historical cost of the old building would be the cost at which it was originally acquired by the company, and it would be used as a basis for calculating any gain or loss on sale. The historical cost would not change even if the building is classified as an asset held for sale.\n\nSo, the correct statements are:\n\n* It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale.\n* It will no longer be depreciated.\n* It will be valued at historical cost.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) It will be classified as a current asset.",

Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson\u2019s individual tax return. If the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate, how much income would Carson have reported on Carson\u2019s individual return?\n\n(A) $28,000\n(B) $132,000\n(C) $160,000\n(D) $188,000",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: $400,000 is the corporation's total taxable income. As a C corporation, it pays tax on its taxable income, so the corporation paid tax on $400,000.\n\nStep 2: The corporation distributed $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders. Since Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock, Carson received 40% of $70,000, which is $28,000.\n\nStep 3: Carson's gross income is $28,000, which consists of the corporation's taxable income of $400,000 and the cash dividend of $70,000.\n\nStep 4: If the corporation had been an S corporation, the taxable income would have passed through to Carson and been reported on Carson's individual tax return. $400,000 is the corporation's total taxable income, and since Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock, the proportionate amount that would have passed through to Carson is 40%. This means that Carson's gross income would have been $400,000 multiplied by 40%, which equals $160,000.\n\nStep 5: However, since the corporation made a cash distribution to its shareholders, the distribution would have been subtracted from Carson's gross income. Carson received a cash distribution of $28,000, which would be subtracted from the proportionate amount of $160,000, resulting in a corrected gross income of $132,000.\n\nStep 6: The answer is (B) $132,000.",
