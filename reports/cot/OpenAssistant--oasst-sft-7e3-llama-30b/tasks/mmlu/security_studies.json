            "model_answer": "(D) The responsibility to rebuild is not an element of the responsibility to protect, because the responsibility to protect focuses on preventing and responding to threats of harm, while the responsibility to rebuild is focused on addressing the consequences of harm that has already occurred. The responsibility to protect includes the principle of the responsibility to prevent, which requires states to take action to prevent atrocities from occurring, and the responsibility to react, which requires states to take action to respond to atrocities that are occurring or have already occurred. The responsibility to remain sovereign is also an element of the responsibility to protect, as it requires states to maintain control over their own affairs and to protect their populations from harm.",

            "model_answer": "(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, can lead to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n\nThis option suggests that environmental challenges can create opportunities for technological advancements that can strengthen military programs. As countries address environmental problems, they may develop new technologies that help them address these challenges, which can also have military applications.\n\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes, then so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n\nThis option suggests that environmental changes can have negative impacts on national security by weakening the economy, which in turn affects military capacity. It also emphasizes that any developments in this area will be \"human\" in impact, meaning that they will be driven by human actions.\n\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n\nThis option suggests that countries' main concern remains external military threats, regardless of their internal environmental problems. While environmental challenges may impact national security, the external military threats remain more pressing.\n\n(D) All of these options.\n\nThis option suggests that environmental changes can have multiple implications for national security. They can create opportunities for technological advancements, but at the same time, they can also weaken a country's economy and military capacity. The external military threats remain a primary concern, but environmental changes can impact national security in various ways.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "model_answer": "step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Statement (A) suggests that energy security is interconnected, and major powers have shared interests in maintaining the free-market conditions, reducing the likelihood of conflict over energy reserves. This statement can be described as liberal because it emphasizes the role of the free market and the interdependence of nations in ensuring energy security.\n2. Statement (B) suggests that energy scarcity may lead to disruptions and the emergence of a new, less liberal international energy order. This perspective highlights the potential negative consequences of scarcity and the possibility of a shift away from free-market trading, which can be seen as a more conservative or realist perspective.\n3. Statement (C) emphasizes the unequal distribution of wealth and power in the current order and suggests that those who benefit from it will maintain the flow of energy under favorable conditions. This perspective highlights the social and economic inequalities in the global system and suggests that they will persist in the energy sector. This statement can be described as a liberal perspective as it acknowledges the inequalities but does not suggest any major changes in the system.\n4. Statement (D) suggests that energy scarcity may lead to a breakdown in international cooperation and even resource wars. This statement highlights the potential for conflict and confrontation over energy resources and emphasizes the importance of cooperation and management, which can be seen as a liberal perspective.\n\nTherefore, the liberal perspective on future energy security is most closely associated with statement (A).\n\nAnswer: (A)",

            "model_answer": "(A) Human security is neo-colonial.\n\nThis criticism argues that human security policies can sometimes be used as a tool for imperialist or colonialist interests, where wealthy nations use their power and influence to interfere in the affairs of other nations under the guise of promoting human rights and security. This can result in a lack of respect for the sovereignty and self-determination of other nations and can ultimately lead to further exploitation and domination by the more powerful nations.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",
