            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer should be (C) Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.\n\nDun & Bradstreet, Inc. is a business services company that provides credit information and analysis on businesses. They offer a range of credit and financial risk management tools, including credit scores and credit reports, that can be used to evaluate a company's creditworthiness. Retail businesses would be one of the types of businesses that they would provide information on.\n\nThe Retail Merchants Association and the local chamber of commerce may provide some information on local retail businesses, but they are unlikely to provide the same level of credit information and analysis as Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. The United States Retail Credit Association is a trade association that represents retail credit professionals, but they do not provide credit information on retail businesses themselves.",

The introduction would involve setting the context and purpose for the lesson, and the conclusion would involve summarizing what was learned and providing a call to action for students to apply what they have learned.",

Throughout the film, Damon displays Ripley's charm, intelligence, and deceptive nature in a captivating manner, making him the best fit for the role.
