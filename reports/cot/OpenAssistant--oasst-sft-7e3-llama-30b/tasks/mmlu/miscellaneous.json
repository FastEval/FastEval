            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(B) Discipline-based inquiry.\n\nExplanation: Discipline-based inquiry is an instructional strategy that involves students in asking questions, gathering and evaluating information, and making sense of an art form or subject. In this case, the teacher is presenting students with short stories and working with them to identify the defining characteristics of the genre, which aligns with the definition of discipline-based inquiry. The other options do not accurately describe the instructional strategy being used by the teacher.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: I don't have specific knowledge on the burning temperature of paper. I need to find a way to solve this question.\n\nStep 2: I see that the answer has four options. I will compare each option to the known facts I have about burning temperature of paper.\n\nStep 3: I know that when paper burns, it becomes fuel for a fire. Paper is cellulose, which is a slow-burning fuel that requires a temperature of approximately 450-500 degrees Celsius to ignite.\n\nStep 4: I will now convert the given Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius to compare with the known temperature range of ignition for paper.\n\n(A) 986 degrees Fahrenheit is approximately equal to 660 degrees Celsius.\n(B) 2125 degrees Fahrenheit is approximately equal to 1160 degrees Celsius.\n(C) 3985 degrees Fahrenheit is approximately equal to 2250 degrees Celsius.\n(D) 451 degrees Fahrenheit is approximately equal to 232.8 degrees Celsius.\n\nStep 5: None of the given options fall within the known temperature range of ignition for paper. Therefore, I can eliminate all options.\n\nStep 6: However, option (D) is the closest to the known temperature range of ignition for paper. Therefore, the answer might be (D) 451 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nStep 7: I will double-check the units to ensure there are no errors in the conversion.\n\nStep 8: Yes, the conversion is correct. Option (D) is the closest to the known temperature range of ignition for paper. Therefore, the answer is (D) 451 degrees Fahrenheit.",
