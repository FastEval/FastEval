To do this, we need to apply a set of rules or inference rules that specify how we can validly draw conclusions from premises.\n\nOne commonly used set of inference rules for PL is the following:\n\n1. Modus ponens: from P and P \u2283 Q, infer Q.\n2. Modus tollens: from P \u2283 Q and ~Q, infer ~P.\n3. Hypothetical syllogism: from P \u2283 Q and Q, infer P.\n4. Disjunctive syllogism: from P or Q and ~P, infer Q.\n5. Conditional proof: from P and P \u2283 Q, infer Q.\n6.irable categorical syllogisms.\n\nIf we apply these inference rules to the given premises, we obtain the following:\n\n1. Premises: ~E \u2283 ~F, G \u2283 F, H \u2228 ~E, H \u2283 I, ~I\n2. From premise 1 and the definition of implication, we can infer that either E is true and ~F is false, or E is false and ~F is true.

From premise 2 and the definition of implication, we can infer that if G is true, then F must also be true. However, we cannot infer anything about the truth values of E and ~E.\n4. From premises 3 and 4 and the definition of disjunction, we can infer that either H is true or ~E is true. However, we cannot infer anything about the truth values of E and ~E.\n5. From premise 5 and the definition of implication, we can infer that if H is true and H \u2283 I, then I must be true. However, we cannot infer anything about the truth values of E and ~E.\n6. From premise 6 and the definition of implication, we can infer that if either ~E or H \u2283 ~E is true, then ~I must be false. However, we cannot infer that ~E is true.\n7.
