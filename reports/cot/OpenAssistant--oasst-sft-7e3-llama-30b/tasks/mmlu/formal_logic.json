So, we have (~A \u2022 ~C).\n\nNow we need to find the implication. We need to figure out what would be true if both negated sentences hold. Since the other connector is the conditional connector (\u2022 \u2283), this means that we need to search for the conditional statement that has the same antecedent as (~B \u2022 E). The antecedent here is (~A \u2022 ~C).\n\nLooking at the key, we see that this antecedent implies D, which is \"Russell makes dinner\".

This proposition asserts that there is a house x, such that x is larger than y for every apartment y.\n\nFirst, we want to show that not every house is bigger than every apartment. To demonstrate this, we need to show that there exists a house that is smaller than an apartment. Therefore, we select the interpretation (A).\n\nGiven (A), we know that there exists a house that is smaller than an apartment. Thus, for this house, the proposition (\u2200y)(Ay \u2283 Bxy) is not satisfied, and therefore the universal quantifier \u2200y cannot be satisfied for all houses. Thus, the original proposition (\u2203x)[Hx \u2022 (\u2200y)(Ay \u2283 Bxy)] is not satisfied, since there exists at least one house that does not satisfy the implication (Ay \u2283 Bxy).

First, we need to identify the statement that is logically prior to (comes before) the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is \"either the president fails to approve it or the board of trustees prevents it.\" So, we need to identify which of the given options comes before this conclusion.\n2. Next, we need to identify the core statement that is being made about the university's decision on financial aid. We can eliminate option (A) immediately because it contradicts the conclusion that financial aid is not being increased.\n3. Now, we are left with options (B), (C), and (D). All of these options suggest that the university is not increasing financial aid, but they differ in their explanations for why not. However, only one of these can be the antecedent of the conclusion.\n4. Let's consider the other two options: (C) implies that the board of trustees is responsible for preventing an increase in financial aid, while (D) implies that the president is responsible for failing to approve an increase in financial aid. However, either of these options could be true independently of each other, which means that they are not mutually exclusive.
