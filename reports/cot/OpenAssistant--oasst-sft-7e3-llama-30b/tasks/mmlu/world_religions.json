            "question": " What can murtis be translated as?\n\n(A) Offerings\n(B) Prayers\n(C) Apparitions\n(D) Idols",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The question asks about the translation of the word \"murtis\". Let's break down the question to understand it better:\n\n1. We need to determine the language from which the word \"murtis\" originates. Without knowing the language, it is difficult to provide an accurate translation.\n2. The word \"murtis\" could be from Sanskrit, a classical language of India.\n3. Sanskrit is a language that has influenced many other languages, including Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali. Knowing the language will help narrow down the possible meanings.\n4. Next, we need to determine the context in which the word \"murtis\" is being used. What is the subject matter, and what is the purpose of the word?\n5. Based on the possible meanings, we can then provide a translation.\n\nGiven the context of offering, prayers, apparitions or idols, we can use the above information to provide a possible translation:\n\n(A) Offerings: The word \"murtis\" could be translated as \"offerings\" based on the context of rituals and worship.\n(B) Prayers: The word \"murtis\" could not be translated as \"prayers\" because prayers are verbal or mental expressions of devotion or supplication.\n(C) Apparitions: The word \"murtis\" could not be translated as \"apparitions\" because apparitions typically refer to the sudden appearance of a supernatural being.\n(D) Idols: The word \"murtis\" could also be translated as \"idols\" based on the context of representing a deity or revered person.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Offerings and (D) Idols, as the word \"murtis\" can have different translations based on the context.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to look at the different options and decide which one is the best fit for the given information.\n\n(A) Daoism and (B) Yin-Yang School are both Chinese philosophies that focus on nature and the natural world. However, they are not specifically associated with naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes.\n\n(C) Mengzi, also known as Mencius, was a Chinese philosopher who is part of the Confucian tradition. While Mencian thought does incorporate ideas about nature and the universe, it is not primarily focused on natural elements and processes.\n\n(D) Humanistic Buddhism is a modern form of Buddhism that emphasizes human dignity and human potential. While this form of Buddhism may include ideas about nature and the natural world, it is not primarily focused on natural elements and processes.\n\nBased on the given information, the best answer would be (A) Daoism and (B) Yin-Yang School, as they are both Chinese philosophies that focus on nature and the natural world. However, the question asks for a single answer, so we need to choose between the two.\n\nSince Daoism is a more well-known philosophy and has a broader focus on nature and the natural world, it would be the better choice as the answer. Therefore, the final answer is (A) Daoism.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) 596 CE.\n\nReasoning:\n\n* The Edo period in Japan is known to have lasted from 1603-1868.\n* The Meiji Restoration in 1868 ended the Edo period and restored practical abilities and consolidated the political system under the Emperor of Japan.\n* Therefore, 596 CE is the earliest year that could be within the Edo period, as it precedes the Meiji Restoration by over 1,000 years.\n* Since the question asks for the first year that could be within the Edo period, we can eliminate (A) 325 CE, (B) 119 CE, and (C) 451 CE, as they are all earlier than 596 CE.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 596 CE.",
