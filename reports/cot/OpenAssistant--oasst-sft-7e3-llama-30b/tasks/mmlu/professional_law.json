            "question": "One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\n(B) admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\n(C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n(D) inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",

            "question": "A state statute provides: \"Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. \" Violation of the statute is made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found\n\n(A) not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(B) not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(C) guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n(D) guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the answer to this question, we should consider the relevant legal principles regarding resistance to arrest and assault.\n\nUnder general principles of law, a person has the right to resist an unlawful arrest by a police officer who does not have probable cause to believe the person has committed a crime. If the arrest is unlawful, the person being arrested has the right to resist the arrest using reasonable force to protect himself or herself.\n\nHowever, if the arrest is lawful, the person being arrested has a duty to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. Violation of this duty makes the person subject to punishment for assault.\n\nBased on the information provided in the question, we cannot determine definitively whether the arrest was lawful or unlawful. The police officer and the suspect have given different accounts of what happened, and we do not have any additional information to support one account over the other.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, we cannot conclude that the suspect should be found guilty or not guilty of assault. It is possible that the jury could find the suspect guilty if they believe the police officer's account and conclude that the arrest was lawful, or they could find the suspect not guilty if they believe the suspect's account and conclude that the arrest was unlawful.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (E) \"It cannot be determined whether the suspect should be found guilty or not guilty of assault, based on the information provided.\"",

Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort.

He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order\n\n(A) valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\n(B) valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\n(C) invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\n(D) invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.",

The grocery store purchased a mirror and brackets from a manufacturer.\n2. The mirror fell and caused injuries to a shopper, who is the plaintiff.\n3. The plaintiff may assert a claim against the carpenter, who installed the mirror on behalf of the grocery store.\n\nIn a strict liability claim in tort, the focus is on the product that caused harm, rather than the behavior of the defendant. The plaintiff must prove that the product was defective and that the defect caused the harm. Defective isn't limited to manufacturing defects but can also be a defect in the product's design.\n\nConsidering the above,\n```markdown\n(A) prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.\n```\nThis option is incorrect. The focus is on the defect of the product itself, not on the defect of the brackets themselves.\n\n1. The next option is\n(B) prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet. \n\nThis option may not prevail as the fact that the mirror was large does not establish that maintaining it on the wall was abnormally dangerous. Maintaining a large mirror on the wall in a grocery store would be considered reasonably safe and not abnormally dangerous.\n\n1. The next option is\n(C) not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n\nA defendant may be found strictly liable for harm caused by a defective product, even if the defendant was not involved in the sale of the product, as long as the defendant's actions caused the product to reach the market with the defect.\n\nSo in this case, if the brackets were defective and caused the harm, the plaintiff would prevail against the carpenter and the mirror manufacturer.\n\n1.
