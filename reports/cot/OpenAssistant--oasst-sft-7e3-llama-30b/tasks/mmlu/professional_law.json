            "question": "One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\n(B) admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\n(C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n(D) inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",

            "question": "A state statute provides: \"Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. \" Violation of the statute is made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found\n\n(A) not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(B) not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(C) guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n(D) guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.",

            "model_answer": "The answer can be inferred from the details of the scenario. We need to analyze the statute, the actions of the police officer and the suspect, and the charges faced by the suspect.\n\nThe statute provides that when a person knows or should know that they are being arrested, it is their duty to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. However, the statute does not specify the consequences of violating this duty.\n\nThe suspect was arrested and charged with assault. This means that the suspect is accused of using force or the threat of force against another person, in this case the police officer.\n\nThe police officer and the suspect have given different accounts of what happened after the arrest. According to the police officer, the suspect resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer responded by hitting the suspect with his nightstick. However, the suspect claims that the police officer began hitting him with the nightstick after the suspect cursed at the policeman. In order to avoid further harm, the suspect hit the police officer back with his fist.\n\nBased on the given information, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\n\nIf the arrest was lawful and the jury believes the suspect's account, then the suspect may be found not guilty of the charges against him. This is because the suspect's actions may have been justified in self-defense if the police officer was unlawfully striking the suspect with the nightstick. However, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause, the suspect may still be found not guilty as per option (A).",

            "question": "A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order\n\n(A) valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\n(B) valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\n(C) invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\n(D) invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.",
