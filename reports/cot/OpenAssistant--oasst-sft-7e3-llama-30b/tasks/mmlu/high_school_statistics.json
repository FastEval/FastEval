            "model_answer": "Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. I look at each of the statements (A) through (D) and try to remember what I know about each one. I recall that (A) is generally true, since \"discrete\" implies that the outcomes can be counted and the word \"random\" indicates that they are not all necessarily positive whole numbers. I also recall that (B) is true, since \"mutually exclusive\" means that only one of the possible outcomes can occur each time the \"experiment\" is performed, as is the case with rolling a die, where \"1\" and \"2\" can both occur, but \"1 and 2\" cannot.\n\n2. Next, I think about what happens when we multiply the probability of each outcome by the value of that outcome. If we add up all these products, won't they equal the sum of the products of each outcome by its corresponding probability in the case of the \"expected value\"? I think it will, since the equations look the same. This leads me to suspect that the answer is (C), since the correct formula for the expected value is most likely never an exact number. When I find the expected \"value\" of a coin flip, I typically compute its expected frequency in the sample space, since it is either 0 or 1.\n\n3. I find that statement (D) is also false, since it never makes sense in the context of the \"expected \"value.\" This is because when we refer to an \"average,\" we usually understand that \"average\" as a number, albeit one that may be a rather abstract one. We cannot refer to an \"average frequency,\" since \"frequency\" is not a numerical concept. Hence (D) is the correct answer.\n\n4. Without further input from the system, I have no way of knowing what the correct answer \"should\" look like. If the system never remembers enough of our previous input to answer \"D\" when it asks which statement is never true, I will simply try to understand the \"hint\" it provides, as long as it evid",

If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level ( beta = 10% ), then there is also sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level ( beta = 5% ) since the 5% level has a higher critical value, which means it's more difficult to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n(B) is a true statement.

However, the confidence interval is estimated using a random sample and may not represent the entire population of students.\n* Option (B) is incorrect because it states that there is a 95% probability that the families of all the students in the school have an income of between $35,095 and $45,005. However, the sampling procedure and confidence interval estimation are used to make inferences about the population based on the random sample, so this cannot be guaranteed for all families.\n* Option (C) is incorrect because computing a confidence interval using a different sample may result in a different interval, and the chance of getting the same interval is dependent on the sample size and variability in the data.",
