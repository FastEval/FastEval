            "model_answer": "The question refers to the concept of incontinence in Aristotle's philosophy. It asks what, in Aristotle's terminology, incontinence is. The options provided are:\n\n* (A) one does not know that one's actions are wrong.\n* (B) one knows that one's actions are wrong, but does them anyway.\n* (C) one knows that one's feelings are inappropriate, and does not act on them.\n* (D) one does the right action, but for the wrong reason.\n\nTo answer this question step-by-step, we need to look at Aristotle's definition of incontinence and see how it matches with the options provided.\n\n1. Incontinence is a term used by Aristotle to describe a type of moral weakness in a person's character. It refers to a situation where someone acts in a way that they know to be wrong, even though they have the ability to act otherwise.\n2. Based on this definition, option (B) seems to be the closest match. It states that \"one knows that one's actions are wrong, but does them anyway.\" This captures the idea that the person is aware of the wrongness of their actions but still engages in them.\n3. However, option (B) does not match perfectly with Aristotle's definition of incontinence. In Aristotle's view, incontinence is not just about knowing that one's actions are wrong. It is also about having the ability to do otherwise and still acting in a way that is wrong.\n4. Option (D) is also not a perfect match. While it suggests that a person does the right action for the wrong reason, it does not capture the idea that the person knows that their actions are wrong.\n5. Options (A) and (C) are not matches at all. Option (A) suggests that the person does not know that their actions are wrong, which does not match with Aristotle's definition of incontinence. Option (C) suggests that the person knows that their feelings are inappropriate but doesn't act on them, which also does not match with the definition of incontinence.\n6. Based on this analysis, option (B) is the closest match but not a perfect one. Therefore, the answer c",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A).\n\nThe reason is that Nagel claims that most skeptical arguments are the result of applying arbitrary stringent standards. This means that people are being too demanding or picky when evaluating something, often to the point of being unreasonable. Nagel argues that these standards are not based on objective facts or logical reasoning, but rather on personal biases or preferences. As a result, skeptical arguments based on these standards are not likely to be convincing or persuasive to others.",

            "model_answer": "A sophisticated cognitive system must be able to disambiguate between alternative sources of knowledge and parse them to generate a hypothesis about what action it should perform, to finally select a response from the hypothesis set generated in 1. In this complex process, the hypotheses neighbor in the hypothesis set are crucial to pick the best action. A rationalization can generate a seed to start exploring hypotheses and select which actions to perform. Kant posits that morality is formally defined as the totality of fundamental principles or categorical imperatives that an autonomous will must obey if its choices are to be morally valid. A categorical imperative is an unconditional moral obligation that applies universally to everyone in every situation regardless of their personal goals or beliefs. This is distinct from a hypothetical imperative, which is a conditional moral obligation that applies only when someone is seeking to achieve some goal but does not constrain them if they do not share this goal. In practical terms, categorical imperatives must be followed because they are binding on all people everywhere regardless of their intentions. When acted upon, this principle generates principles that are tailored to specific situations. Categorical imperatives ought to be free and a priori. In other words, they are universally binding on all autonomous beings only if they act rationally and impartially towards one another.\n\n(D)",
