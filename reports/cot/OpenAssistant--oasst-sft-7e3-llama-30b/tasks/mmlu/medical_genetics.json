            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(D) ends of the long arms.\nExplanation:\nA Robertsonian translocation is a type of chromosomal rearrangement in which two chromosomes fuse together at their ends.\nThe ends of the chromosomes that are involved in the fusion are the terminal ends, which are also referred to as the \"tips\" or \"pensus\" of the chromosomes. These ends contain the telomeres, which protect the ends of the chromosomes from degradation and fusion.\nTherefore, the answer is (D) ends of the long arms.",

            "model_answer": "First, we must understand that X-linked recessive conditions affect only males since the females have two X chromosomes and therefore have a normal copy that can mask the mutated one.\n\nThen, we need to figure out how many females carrying the mutated gene we would expect in a population where 1 in 10 males are affected.\n\nSince the mutation is X-linked and recessive, we expect to find it in homozygous form only in females.\n\nWe should first recall the basic rule of genetic inheritance, which is:\n\nMales have one X and one Y chromosome\nFemales have two X chromosomes\nThat means:\n\nIn males, an X-linked condition will show up if the only functioning copy of the gene is mutated. That is, in males the condition is recessive.\nIn females, there are two copies of the X-linked gene present. For the condition to show up, both copies need to be mutated (since those are the only functioning copies). In females, the condition is dominant.\n\nSince we are looking for affected females in a population where 1 in 10 males are affected, we should look at the females who have a mutated X chromosome and a normal Y chromosome from their fathers, and a mutated X chromosome from their mothers. These would be the heterozygous females with the mutated gene.\n\nThen we can calculate the expected frequency of affected females as the product of the frequency of affected males and the proportion of females among humans.\n\nThe frequency of affected females is 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 (or 5 in 100)\n\nThe answer is (C) 0.02",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the pattern of inheritance of malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia), we need to consider the genetic trait that causes this condition. The pattern of inheritance depends on how the genetic information is passed from parents to their offspring.\n\nWe need to consider the following facts:\n\n* Malignant hyperthermia is a genetic disorder that affects skeletal muscles.\n* It is caused by a defect in the ryanodine receptor (RYR1), a protein that plays a vital role in regulating the release of calcium in muscles.\n* The defective RYR1 protein leads to an abnormal release of calcium in muscles, which results in muscle rigidity, fever, and occasional heart arrest\n\n(A) Autosomal dominant inheritance means that the offspring with only one copy (heterozygous) of the mutated gene inherits the condition from one parent who has the condition. In this case, it's not clear whether someone who inherits one mutated copy would develop malignant hyperthermia. Some cases may be inherited as autosomal dominant, but it's not the primary pattern.\n\n(B) Autosomal recessive inheritance means that the offspring inherit two copies (homozygous) of the mutated gene to express the condition. It is a possibility that two unaffected, but unknowing carriers have children who will be affected. But it is not the primary pattern.\n\n(C) X-linked dominant inheritance means that the offspring inherits one copy of the mutated gene located on the X chromosome from the mother, who may be affected. In this case, it's possible that X-linked dominant inheritance happens in some cases, but it's not the primary pattern.\n\n(D) X-linked recessive inheritance means that the offspring inherits two copies of the mutated gene located on the X chromosome (homozygous) from the mother, who may be affected. In this case, it's not clear whether someone who inherits two mutated copies would express the disease which goes against X-linked recessive inheritance and it is not the primary pattern.\n\nThe answer is (E) None of the above.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Exon skipping is a genetic technique used to treat certain genetic disorders. This technique involves the modification of the splicing pattern of a pre-mRNA molecule in such a way that one or more exons are skipped during the process of mRNA maturation. The resulting mRNA transcript contains a different sequence of exons compared to the original mRNA transcript, and this can result in the production of a differently functional protein.\n\nThe question asks us to associate exon skipping with a particular type of mutation.\n\n(A) Nonsense mutations result in the production of a truncated protein, which is often non-functional. This is not the case for exon skipping, where the goal is to produce a functional protein, although with a different amino acid sequence.\n\n(B) Regulatory mutations affect the regulation of gene expression, which is not the case for exon skipping.\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations can affect various aspects of mRNA maturation, including splicing. Therefore, it is possible that some types of RNA processing mutations could be associated with exon skipping.\n\n(D) Silent mutations do not change the amino acid sequence of a protein, which is the case for exon skipping.\n\nThe answer is C) RNA processing mutations.",
