            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A)\n\nThis is a question about X-linked recessive inheritance. The condition is caused by a mutated gene on the X chromosome. Since it is recessive, both copies of the gene must be mutated in order for the individual to show symptoms. Males only have one X chromosome, so it is much more likely for them to be affected than females who have two X chromosomes and require both of them to be mutated.\n\nThe frequency of affected males is given as 0.10, or 1 in 10. This means that it is possible to have a female who is a carrier of the mutation, but does not show symptoms. If we assume that the frequency of carriers is the same as the frequency of affected individuals, then we can use the formula:\n\nFrequency of carriers = Frequency of affected females = (Frequency of affected males) / (1 + PM)\n\nWhere PM is the proportion of males in the population, which is 0.5.\n\nFrequency of carriers = (0.10) / (1 + 0.5) = 0.20\n\nThe frequency of affected females is equal to the frequency of carriers, which is 0.20, or 1 in 5.\n\n(A)",

This is known as A-G base pairing. Cytosine and thymine both pair with adenine, but in different ways. Cytosine pairs with adenine through three hydrogen bonds in the major groove of DNA, while thymine pairs with adenine through two hydrogen bonds in the major groove of DNA. Uracil is not normally found in DNA, but when it is present, it pairs with adenine through two hydrogen bonds in the major groove of DNA. Therefore, the correct answer is B, guanine.",

One possibility is that traumatic events, such as war or natural disasters, can lead to changes in the parent's physiology or behavior that can be passed on to their children. Hunger is another possible factor that could affect the parent and their offspring.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer is option (D) all of these.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question step-by-step, first we need to recognize that the prefix \"Asp\" indicates aspartic acid, while the prefix \"Phe\" indicates phenylalanine. Next, we can identify that the given sequence contains these two amino acids, either in their original or mutated forms. To deduce whether this sequence represents a mutation or a replacement, we can analyze the products generated when these two amino acids react to form a peptide bond.\n\nWhen aspartic acid and phenylalanine form a peptide bond in a protein, the resulting product has a different structure compared to a peptide bond formed by two phenylalanine molecules. This structural difference results from the reaction between the carboxylic acid group of aspartic acid and the side chain of phenylalanine. This reaction forms a new linkage between the two molecules that differs in its physical properties from the peptide bond formed by two phenylalanine molecules.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, if a molecular report indicates \"Asp235Phe\", it means that aspartic acid at position 235 has been replaced by phenylalanine. Thus, the answer is (A).\n\nAnswer: (A) asparagine has been replaced by phenylalanine.",
