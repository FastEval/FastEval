            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation in the left thigh is compressions of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, option (C). The description of the numbness being limited to a specific area, the decrease in sensation to light touch, and the improvement of symptoms over time, are all consistent with compression of a nerve. Additionally, the patient's hospital course with pulmonary embolism and retroperitoneal hemorrhage, followed by placement of an IVC filter, creates a high likelihood of the nerve being compressed during hospitalization.\n\nAlthough a cerebral infarction could also cause decreased sensation, option (A), it is less likely as the patient's vital signs are within normal limits. Option (B) is less likely as a complication of the IVC filter placement as the filter was placed 2 weeks ago and the symptoms are improving. Option (D) is less likely as the hematoma was resolved at the time of hospital discharge.",

            "question": "A 25-year-old gravida 3 para 2 female is admitted to the hospital at 39\u00a0weeks' gestation in active labor. She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated. The most likely diagnosis is\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions\n(B) lower uterine retraction ring\n(C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction\n(D) primary dysfunctional labor",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the terms used in the description:\n\n* Gravida 3 para 2: This means the woman has been pregnant three times and has given birth to two babies.\n* Active labor: This is the stage of labor when the cervix is dilating and contractions are strong and frequent.\n* Engaged fetal head: This means the fetal head is positioned at the cervical opening.\n* Membranes intact: This means the amniotic sac surrounding the baby is still intact.\n* Cervix 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated: This means the cervix is completely thinned out and opening up (effacement) and is also opening up (dilation) to a diameter of 7 cm.\n\nNow, let's consider the symptoms described in the scenario:\n\n* Regular contractions every 4 minutes, now intermittent and weak contractions.\n* Use of medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours.\n* No reason for obstructed labor based on examination.\n\nBased on these symptoms and the woman's pregnancy history, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n(D) primary dysfunctional labor.\n\nPrimary dysfunctional labor is a condition where the uterus fails to contract effectively during delivery, resulting in prolonged labor, weak contractions, and sometimes fetal distress. The woman's regular contractions that have now become intermittent and weak, as well as the need for pain medication, suggest that she is experiencing primary dysfunctional labor. The intact membranes, engaged fetal head, and normal fetal heart tones also support this diagnosis, as they rule out other potential causes of prolonged labor such as a lower uterine retraction ring or obstructed labor. The 100% effacement and 7 cm dilation of the cervix are also consistent with primary dysfunctional labor.",

            "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of a low-grade fever, cough, and runny nose. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04). Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation of these study results?\n\n(A) The findings are clinically and statistically significant\n(B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant\n(C) The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant\n(D) The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Answer (A): The findings are clinically and statistically significant.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. This design is considered the gold standard in clinical research as it reduces the likelihood of bias and confounding factors.\n2. The study's primary outcome was the mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug compared to those receiving the placebo.\n3. The study found a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p=0.04). This means that the difference in the mean time for resolution of symptoms is unlikely to have occurred by chance.\n4. Clinical significance can be defined as whether the observed differences in outcomes between the two groups are meaningful or important. A reduction of 0.3 days in the mean time for resolution of symptoms for the new drug compared to the placebo may be considered clinically significant. A difference of 0.3 days may represent a noteworthy reduction in the duration of symptoms for patients with the common cold.\n5. Therefore, the findings of the study are both clinically and statistically significant.",

The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?\n\n(A) Atrial fibrillation\n(B) Cor pulmonale\n(C) Systemic hypertension\n(D) Tricuspid valve regurgitation",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Systemic hypertension.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The patient's medical history of pneumonia at age 3 years and the presence of a grade 3/6 systolic murmur on cardiac examination suggest a possible underlying cardiac condition.\n* The chest x-ray showing mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence, along with the ECG showing left ventricular hypertrophy, further support this impression.\n* Systemic hypertension is a potential complication of left ventricular hypertrophy. While the patient's height, weight, and BMI are at the 25th percentile, the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy in a child who is not obese suggests that the hypertension may be due to an underlying cardiac or other metabolic disorder.\n* Atrial fibrillation (answer A) and cor pulmonale (answer B) are both possible complications of left ventricular hypertrophy, but these are more commonly seen in adults. Tricuspid valve regurgitation (answer D) is a possible complication of left ventricular hypertrophy, but the radiofemoral delay and weak femoral pulses suggest that the primary problem is likely to be with the left ventricle rather than the tricuspid valve.",

This is option (B) in the question.\n\nGraves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland. It is characterized by an overactive thyroid gland, which can result in hyperthyroidism and symptoms such as those experienced by the patient. The 131I scan shows an enlarged thyroid gland with areas of increased and decreased uptake, which is consistent with Graves' disease.\n\nThe other options may also be possibilities, but they are less likely given the patient's symptoms and scan results. A defect in T4 biosynthesis (option A) could potentially cause hypothyroidism, but not hyperthyroidism as seen in this patient. Multinodular goiter (option C) may also cause an enlarged thyroid gland, but would not typically result in hyperthyroidism or the other symptoms experienced by the patient. Riedel's thyroiditis (option D) is a rare inflammatory disorder that can cause an enlarged thyroid gland, but would not typically cause hyperthyroidism or the other symptoms seen in this patient.\n\nOverall, based on the patient's symptoms and scan results, Graves' disease is the most likely diagnosis, and option (B) is correct.",
