            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning for the answer:\n\nWe are looking for the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation on her left thigh. The patient had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She also had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage and underwent placement of an IVC filter. Additionally, she had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. The patient is currently taking warfarin as the only medication.\n\nThe patient reports a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away. The sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. The examination shows decreased sensation to light touch over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh.\n\nBased on this information, the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is:\n\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is responsible for sensation in the anterolateral thigh, and compression of this nerve can cause decreased sensation in this area. There is no evidence of a cerebral infarction during the hospitalization, and the IVC filter placement and hematoma were resolved before the patient's current visit. While other causes of decreased sensation are possible, compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is the most likely explanation given the patient's symptoms and examination findings.\n\nAnswer: (C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.",

            "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of a low-grade fever, cough, and runny nose. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04).

            "model_answer": "(B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant.\n\nBased on the given information, the study results are statistically significant (p=0.04), which means that the observed difference between the group who received the new drug and the group who received the placebo is unlikely to have occurred by chance. However, the clinical significance of the results is not as straightforward to determine. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, which is 0.3 days shorter than the mean time for the placebo group (6.7 days). To put this in perspective, 0.3 days is less than one day, so the difference is very small and could be considered clinically insignificant. Therefore, the most appropriate interpretation of the study results is that they are statistically significant but clinically insignificant.",

            "question": "A 9-year-old boy is brought to the office by his parents for a well-child examination. The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?\n\n(A) Atrial fibrillation\n(B) Cor pulmonale\n(C) Systemic hypertension\n(D) Tricuspid valve regurgitation",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To figure out the answer, we will go through the relevant information step-by-step:\n\n* The boy is 9 years old and has not been seen by a doctor in 4 years. However, he was previously diagnosed with pneumonia at the age of 3.\n* He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI.\n* His vital signs are normal, but he has a grade 3/6 systolic murmur and a radiofemoral delay. The x-ray shows mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence, and his ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\nBased on this information, the most likely complication is:\n\n(D) Tricuspid valve regurgitation.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The patient's cardiac murmur and left ventricular hypertrophy suggest that he has some kind of heart condition. The radiofemoral delay, which is a delay in the pulse wave reaching the femoral artery, is also consistent with a problem with blood flow through the heart.\n* Tricuspid valve regurgitation occurs when the tricuspid valve becomes damaged and does not close properly, leading to blood flowing back into the heart instead of being pumped out to the lungs. This can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling in the legs and feet, among other symptoms.\n* The patient's previous diagnosis of pneumonia and his family's recent immigration to the US also raise the possibility that he may be at increased risk for other respiratory infections or illnesses. However, without more specific details about his condition and his recent medical history, it is difficult to say for certain what other complications he may be at risk for.",

            "question": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of numbness in her right hand. During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?\n\n(A) Median nerve at the wrist\n(B) Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm\n(C) Radial nerve at the forearm\n(D) Ulnar nerve at the elbow",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Here is the reasoning for each option:\n\n(A) Median nerve at the wrist: This is likely the cause of the numbness. The median nerve runs through the carpal tunnel in the wrist and if it is compressed it can cause numbness in the ring and small fingers. The pain when palpating the elbow is also more consistent with a nerve issue rather than a bony issue since palpation at the wrist or forearm would be more likely to cause pain if it were bony. The symptoms of tingling in the ring and small fingers and weaker grip are also more consistent with something around the wrist.\n\n(B) Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm: This nerve is responsible for movement of the biceps muscle and does not innervate the fingers. The symptoms are more consistent with sensation issues rather than movement issues.\n\n(C) Radial nerve at the forearm: This nerve innervates the triceps muscle and also travels down to the back of the hand and supplies sensation to the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and half of the ring finger. However, the symptoms are more consistent with issues from the palm side of the hand which is more consistent with the median nerve.\n\n(D) Ulnar nerve at the elbow: This nerve travels down the arm and runs around the outside of the elbow. This can cause numbness and tingling in the ring and small fingers and half of the palm, which is similar to the symptoms reported here. However, the pain when palpating the elbow is less consistent and the fact that the patient presented with more consistent carpal tunnel symptoms, makes option (A) the most likely cause.\n\nAnswer: (A) Median nerve at the wrist.",
