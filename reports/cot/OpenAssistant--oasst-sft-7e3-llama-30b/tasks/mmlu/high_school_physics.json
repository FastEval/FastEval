The tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which is inversely proportional to the wavelength. Therefore, when the tension in the string is increased, the wave speed will increase and the wavelength will decrease.

The voltage across the capacitors is the same in parallel as it is in series.\n2. The total capacitance is the sum of the individual capacitances.\n\nWith that in mind, let's go through the possible answer choices:\n\n(A) The charge stored on the capacitor: If we have two identical capacitors, this quantity should be the same. In parallel, the voltages are the same, which means the charges will be the same too. (Although, technically speaking, charges don't have to be exactly the same - they could be mirror images of each other. But for the purposes of this question, we'll say they are the same.)\n\n(B) The voltage across the capacitor: Since the two capacitors are in parallel, the voltage will be the same across both of them. Again, this assumes the batteries or power source are identical and can deliver equal currents through both capacitors.\n\n(C) The capacitance of the capacitor: The total capacitance of the two capacitors in parallel will be the sum of their individual capacitances. So, this is also correct.\n\n(D) (E) I, II, and III: Well, we already ruled out III (capacitance of the capacitor) and II (voltage across the capacitor) for the reasons I mentioned earlier. I (the charge stored on the capacitor) could be different, depending on how the circuit is wired and the charges build up.
