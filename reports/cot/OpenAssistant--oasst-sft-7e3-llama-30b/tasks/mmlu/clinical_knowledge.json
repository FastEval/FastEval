            "model_answer": "To determine the size of cannula needed for a rapid blood transfusion, we must consider several factors including the patient's age, weight, and condition. However, according to the options provided, here are my reasoning steps:\n\n1. 18 gauge is smaller than 20 gauge, so it might be faster to infuse blood through it. However, it might not be large enough to deliver a sufficient amount of blood quickly.\n2. 20 gauge is the most commonly used size for blood transfusion. It strikes a balance between size and flow rate.\n3. 22 gauge is even smaller than 20 gauge. Although it may be faster to infuse blood, it might not deliver a sufficient amount of blood quickly enough.\n4. 24 gauge is the smallest size option. It may not be able to deliver a sufficient amount of blood for a rapid transfusion.\n\nTherefore, based on the options provided, my answer is:\n\n(B) 20 gauge.",

Sprinting requires a high intensity of exercise, which is associated with an increased demand for energy.\n2. The body's metabolism has to adapt to meet this increased energy demand.\n3. In terms of metabolism, sprinting is primarily anaerobic, meaning it relies on processes that do not require oxygen to produce energy.\n4. As the number of sprints increases, the body has to rely more heavily on anaerobic metabolism to keep up with the increased demand for energy.\n5. Therefore, the relative contribution of anaerobic metabolism increases, leading to an increased anaerobic contribution.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, I want to clarify that the statement \"Sodium bicarbonate ingestion improves middle distance running performance\" is a scientific claim that requires evidence to support it. There have been studies conducted on the effects of sodium bicarbonate on athletic performance, and they have yielded mixed results.\n\nAssuming that sodium bicarbonate ingestion does improve middle distance running performance, the reasoning behind it boils down to the properties of sodium bicarbonate as a buffer.\n\nA buffer is a substance that resists changes in pH upon the addition of small amounts of an acid or a base. In the context of the human body, buffering capacity refers to the ability of the extracellular fluid to \"buffer\" the hydrogen ions produced during intense exercise, thus preventing the decrease in muscle pH that leads to fatigue.\n\nOption (A) is correct. Elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allows for a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle. By \"elevating the buffering capacity,\" we mean that sodium bicarbonate increases the ability of the extracellular fluid to neutralize hydrogen ions as they are produced by muscles during exercise, allowing them to be eliminated more quickly. This effect is \"faster,\" meaning that it helps to reduce fatigue more quickly than if the buffering capacity were not elevated.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) coenzyme A (CoA).\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. Fatty acids are large molecules that cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane freely.\n2. In order to enter the mitochondria and be broken down for energy, fatty acids need to be transported by a carrier molecule.\n3. The most common carrier molecule for fatty acids is coenzyme A (CoA), which can bind to fatty acids and transport them into the mitochondria.\n4. Once inside the mitochondria, the fatty acid can be broken down by the enzymes of the Krebs cycle to produce ATP.\n5. The other options (thiokinase, acetyl-CoA, and carnitine) are not involved in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) coenzyme A (CoA).",
