            "model_answer": "First, let's consider the purpose of a cannula in a rapid blood transfusion.\n\n* A cannula is a device used to puncture the skin and provide access to blood vessels, such as veins or arteries.\n* In a rapid blood transfusion, the goal is to quickly administer a large volume of blood or blood products to a patient.\n* The size of the cannula can affect the rate at which blood can be administered and the patient's comfort during the procedure.\n\nNext, let's consider the options provided and their characteristics.\n\n* Option A, an 18 gauge cannula, is one of the smallest available sizes.\n* Option B, a 20 gauge cannula, is slightly larger than an 18 gauge.\n* Option C, a 22 gauge cannula, is larger still.\n* Option D, a 24 gauge cannula, is the largest of the options provided.\n\nBased on the information above and the purpose of the cannula in a rapid blood transfusion, it makes sense to choose the largest cannula possible while still maintaining the patient's comfort.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) 24 gauge.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer depends on what is meant by *successful.* \n\nIf successful means setting the world record, then:\n\n* Strength to be able to apply large forces to the ground, whereas power is the rate at which strength can be applied. Stride length is decided by the forces, so stride length is indirectly affected by strength\n* Stamina to be able to keep going over the marathon distance.\n\nIf successful means completing the marathon and nothing else, then:\n\n* Stamina is most important. You can predict finish times for the marathon by VO2 max, which is a proxy for stamina. The selection of most of the worlds top marathon runners occurs using VO2 max tests\n* Power is also relevant for whether someone can complete the marathon. For example, a runners power will determine how quickly they can run uphill and downhill sections and how quickly they can cover the flats in between.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n(A) strength.\n\nThis is because, although I gave two possible definitions of successful, I didn't say stamina was equally as important as power for completing the marathon. Given the length of the wording of the explanation for stamina being relevant, the extra information that power is also relevant and the lack of similar emphasis on stamina being relevant, means that power is most relevant attribute for completing the marathon out of stamina and power.",

Closed pouches are often used for colostomies, as they provide a secure and reliable way to contain and manage the output.

            "correct_answer": 3,

This shift towards aerobic metabolism leads to an increase in the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism.\n* Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\nNote that anaerobic metabolism continues to contribute throughout exercise, but its relative contribution decreases as aerobic metabolism becomes more prominent.",

            "model_answer": "First of all, it's important to understand what diplopia (also known as double vision) is and what can cause it. Diplopia occurs when an object is perceived as two images instead of one, and it can be caused by a variety of factors such as refractive errors, muscle imbalance, brain injury, or eye diseases.\n\nNow, let's examine the given options:\n\n(A) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered: This statement is false. Diplopia can occur even if one eye is covered.\n(B) The outer image is always the false image: This statement is false. The outer image can be either the correct or the false image, depending on the underlying cause of diplopia.\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards: This statement is partly true. A fourth nerve palsy (also called superior oblique palsy) can cause diplopia, and one of the symptoms is that the double vision becomes worse when the patient looks upwards. However, it's not the only cause of diplopia.\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint: This statement is partly true. A sixth nerve palsy (also called abducens nerve palsy) can cause a divergent squint, which is a type of squint where the eye deviates outward. However, it's not the only cause of diplopia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint (parentheses not needed)",

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is an alkali that can be used as an acid buffer in the body. When ingested, it is metabolized into bicarbonate (HCO3-) and hydrogen ions (H+), which can affect the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid.\n2. During high-intensity exercise, there is an accumulation of hydrogen ions in muscle due to anaerobic metabolism. These hydrogen ions can contribute to muscle fatigue.\n3. If the extracellular fluid pH and buffering capacity are increased, it may be possible to remove hydrogen ions from muscle more efficiently, leading to a decrease in the accumulation of hydrogen ions and an improvement in performance.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.\n\nFinal answer: (A)",
