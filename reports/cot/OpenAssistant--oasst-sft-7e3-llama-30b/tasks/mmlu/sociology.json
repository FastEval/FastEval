            "model_answer": "(C) the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers\n\nThe mass-society theory suggests that the media has a powerful influence on society, particularly on the subordinate classes who are seen as vulnerable and passive consumers. This theory argues that the media manipulates the beliefs, opinions, and attitudes of the masses, ultimately shaping their worldview and behavior. This manipulation is believed to be done intentionally by the ruling class, which seeks to maintain its dominant position in society. Unlike market forces, which are driven by economic considerations, this theory posits that the media's content is determined by the ideology of the ruling class, aimed at preserving its dominance. Audiences, on the other hand, are seen as receptive and credulous, rather than active participants who engage in selective interpretation of media messages.",

Research the definition of organic solidarity by \u00c9mile Durkheim.\n3. Research the definition of mechanical solidarity by \u00c9mile Durkheim.\n4. Research the definition of gesellschaft by Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies.\n5. Search for any similarities or differences between gemeinschaft and each of the other terms.\n6. Based on the information gathered, consider which option most accurately describes the relationship between gemeinschaft and mechanical solidarity.\n7. Output the final answer after evaluating the options and verifying the information.\n\nAnswer:\n(A) organic solidarity (after evaluating the options and verifying the information).\n\nExplanation:\nFerdinand T\u00f6nnies defined gemeinschaft as a type of social organization based on personal relationships and commitments, while gesellschaft is a more impersonal and categorical social organization. \u00c9mile Durkheim defined mechanical solidarity as the cohesion and interdependence in society based on shared morals and values, while organic solidarity is the cohesion and interdependence in society based on differentiated social roles. In this case, mechanical solidarity is more similar to gemeinschaft than the other options, as gemeinschaft also emphasizes personal relationships and commitments in a more tight-knit community. Organic solidarity, on the other hand, emphasizes the interdependence and differentiation of social roles in a more complex and differentiated society, which is more similar to the characteristics of gesellschaft.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) because growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Income inequality refers to the distribution of income among different groups in society.\n2. In the 1980s, there was a growth in income inequality.\n3. To understand why income inequality grew, we need to examine factors that could have contributed to the unequal distribution of income.\n4. Answer option (A) states that rates of income tax increased equally for all occupational groups. This answer option is incorrect because income inequality can still exist even if everyone pays the same rate of tax.\n5. Answer option (B) states that there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them. This answer option does not directly contribute to income inequality because having more jobs available could actually help reduce income inequality if these jobs provide better pay and opportunities for people from different backgrounds.\n6. Answer option (C) states that the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings. This answer option is incorrect because changes in consumer prices do not directly affect income inequality. However, high inflation can result in changes to wage rates and other economic factors that could affect income inequality.\n7. Answer option (D) states that growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits. This answer option is correct because a high unemployment rate can lead to an increase in the demand for welfare benefits, which are typically provided to those with lower incomes. As a result, income inequality can grow if the benefits do not adequately address the needs of those who are unemployed.\n8. Therefore, the answer is (D) because growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits.",
