            "model_answer": "To determine where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, we need to look for the point at which the two lines intersect. We are given the following options:\n\n* (A) total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance\n* (B) total revenue is equal to total cost\n* (C) marginal product is at its highest point\n* (D) total product is at its highest point\n\nWe can eliminate option (A) since it does not directly relate to the equality between marginal revenue and marginal cost.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because if total revenue is equal to total cost, it means the firm is making zero profit, which is not necessarily the point at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost.\n\nOption (C) is closer to the correct answer, but is still not fully accurate. The marginal product is the change in total product due to a unit change in a factor of production. The marginal product will be at its highest point when the firm is using all factors of production efficiently. However, this is not necessarily the point at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost.\n\nOption (D) is the correct answer. At the point where total product is at its highest point, we can be sure that marginal product is also at its highest point. Therefore, the marginal cost at this point will be equal to the marginal revenue.\n\nAnswer: (D) total product is at its highest point.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D). To arrive at the answer, we need to compare the marginal product of labor and the marginal product of capital. Since the marginal product of labor is 200 and the price of labor is $2, it means that each unit of labor yields output worth $200. Similarly, since the marginal product of capital is 50 and the price of capital is $1, it means that each unit of capital yields output worth $50.\n\nSince the marginal product of labor is much higher than the marginal product of capital, it is more efficient to reduce the usage of capital and increase the usage of labor. This will increase the marginal product of labor and reduce the marginal product of capital. However, since we are given the options to choose from, we need to pick the closest option.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because we want to decrease the usage of capital, not increase it. Option (B) is incorrect because we want to increase the usage of labor, not decrease it. Option (C) is wrong because we want to increase the usage of labor, not decrease it. Therefore, the correct answer is option (D).",

When there is an externality, the price of the good or service does not reflect the true social cost or social benefit of the product, leading to a market failure and an artificially high or low price.\n\n(C) exists when markets cannot reach equilibrium because an externality is a cost or benefit that is not reflected in the price of a good or service. When there is an externality, it can lead to market failure, as the price of the good or service does not reflect the true social cost or social benefit of the product, which can prevent the market from reaching an equilibrium.\n\n(D) results in an equilibrium that does not maximize the total benefit to society because an externality is a cost or benefit that is not reflected in the price of a good or service. When there is an externality, the price of the good or service does not reflect the true social cost or social benefit of the product, which can lead to a situation where the market equilibrium does not maximize the total benefit to society.

            "model_answer": "(D) Joint profit maximization costs society consumer surplus as the price rises above competitive levels. Governments and competition agencies are concerned about the negative impact of large firms in the same industry colluding on the price of goods and services. One reason for this is because collusion can lead to higher prices and reduction in consumer surplus. When firms collude, they can work together to set prices higher than what would be the case in a competitive market. This can hurt consumers as they end up paying more for the product. Additionally, colluding firms might engage in joint profit maximization where they strive to maximize joint profits which can further drive up prices and reduce consumer surplus.",
