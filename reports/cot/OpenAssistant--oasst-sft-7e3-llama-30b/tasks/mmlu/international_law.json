            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which State ordinarily exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels, let's consider the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant international law and principles related to jurisdiction on the high seas, particularly regarding crimes committed on board vessels.\n2. Review the options presented and eliminate any that are clearly not in compliance with international law and principles.\n3. Analyze the remaining options and apply the relevant legal principles to determine the most appropriate one.\n\nAfter applying the above steps and analyzing the relevant legal principles and international law, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) The coastal State. According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the coastal State has \"sovereignty over the territorial sea\" and \"jurisdiction in respect of criminal acts committed on board a ship flying the flag of a State other than the coastal State, committed within its territorial sea\" (Article 58). Therefore, the correct answer is (A) The coastal State.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the meaning of \"justiciability,\" we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Read the options: We have four options, (A), (B), (C), and (D).\n2. Identify the key terms: \"justiciability,\" \"possibility of enforcement,\" \"nature or cause of a right,\" \"courts' assessment,\" \"principles of justice,\" and \"obligation of a State to enforce a right.\"\n3. Understand the context: \"Justiciability\" refers to the ability to bring a legal claim to a court for resolution. It implies that the court has the power to hear the case and make a decision.\n4. Eliminate obviously incorrect options: (D) is not correct because it refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a right, which is a different concept from justiciability.\n5. Analyze the remaining options: (A) and (C) both refer to the court's assessment of a legal claim, while (B) refers to the nature or cause of a right. Since justiciability is about the court's power to hear a case, options (A) and (C) are more relevant.\n6. Choose the best option: The correct option is (A) because it describes the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders. In other words, justiciability refers to whether a legal claim can be brought to a court and whether the court has the power to hear and decide the case.\n7. Answer: (A)\n\nTherefore, the meaning of justiciability is \"Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders.\"",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is option (C): R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\nR2P and humanitarian intervention are two concepts related to the protection of civilians in situations of conflict or mass atrocities. However, there are some important differences between the two:\n\n(A) R2P and humanitarian intervention are not essentially the same. While both concepts are concerned with the protection of civilians, R2P focuses on preventing and responding to mass atrocities, while humanitarian intervention is a broader category that can include any intervention motivated by humanitarian concerns.\n\n(B) R2P does not require a call for assistance by the State in distress. R2P is based on the principle that States have a responsibility to protect their populations from mass atrocities, and that the international community has a responsibility to assist States in fulfilling this responsibility. If a State is unable or unwilling to protect its population, the international community may take action to protect civilians, with or without the consent of the State.\n\n(D) R2P does not always involve armed force. R2P is a broad concept that includes a range of measures, from diplomatic and economic sanctions to military intervention as a last resort. Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, can involve the use of armed force to protect civilians, without the consent of the State where the intervention is taking place.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C): R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis. R2P is a framework for preventing and responding to mass atrocities that involves a range of measures and requires the involvement of the international community, including the UN Security Council. Its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis and protect civilians, rather than intervening arbitrarily in a State's internal affairs.",

These sources establish the powers and procedures of the different branches of government and the rights of citizens.\n\nOne key feature of the UK Constitution is that it is not entrenched, meaning that it can be changed by ordinary legislation. This is different from many other constitutions, which require more difficult procedures to be changed.\n\nAnother key feature of the UK Constitution is that it provides for parliamentary sovereignty, meaning that Acts of Parliament are the highest form of law and cannot be overturned by the courts.

Specifically, Protocol 14 added a new criterion that requires cases to be \"significant disadvantage\" in order to be considered admissible.\n* Additionally, Protocol 14 made changes to the composition of the Court, including the creation of a separate Senate and the abolition of the troikas.\n* However, Protocol 14 did not abolish the Commission of Human Rights.
