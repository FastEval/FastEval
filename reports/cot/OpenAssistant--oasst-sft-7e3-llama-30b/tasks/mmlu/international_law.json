            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Based on the given options, the correct answer to the meaning of justiciability is (A) as it refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders.\n\nJusticiability refers to the capacity of a court to hear and decide a legal case. It is a jurisdictional issue that determines whether a legal claim should be heard by a court, and if so, which court has the authority to hear it. Thus, justiciability is closely linked to the concept of standing, which refers to the ability of a party to bring a legal claim before a court based on their interest in the matter.\n\nJusticiability is considered when a legal claim is raised against the government or a public authority which involves the enforcement of a fundamental right or a constitutional provision. The court examines whether the claim is capable of being decided by it, and whether the party has the necessary standing to bring the claim.\n\nTherefore, option (A) which refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders is the correct answer, as it reflects the idea that courts must consider the ability of a party to bring a legal claim before they can hear and decide the case.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\nR2P is a United Nations framework for responding to massive and serious violations of human rights in a State. It outlines the responsibility of the international community to take appropriate action to protect populations at risk. Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, refers to the use of force by one State to protect the inhabitants of another State without the consent of the targeted State.\n\nThe key difference between R2P and humanitarian intervention is that R2P is a framework that requires the involvement of the international community and decision-making by appropriate international bodies such as the UN Security Council, while humanitarian intervention is a unilateral action taken by one State. This means that R2P is generally considered to be less arbitrary, as it requires some level of input and decision-making by international bodies such as the UNSC. Additionally, R2P's primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis, whereas humanitarian intervention may be used for a variety of reasons.",

            "model_answer": "The 'Lotus' in the 'Lotus principle' refers to the name of a controversial court case, the 'Lotus Case', that was brought before the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) in 1927. The PCIJ is the predecessor of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. The ICJ settles legal disputes between States and provides advisory opinions on legal questions.\n\nThe question asks what the 'Lotus principle' is, and it provides four options to choose from:\n\n(A) The so-called Lotus principle is that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', or, as it has been construed, 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law'\n(B) The so-called Lotus principle is that States are free to choose the Court that they will submit their disputes\n(C) The so-called Lotus principle is that States are not prohibited to assert their enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas\n(D) The so-called Lotus principle is that customary law derives from the combination of State practice and opinio juris\n\nOption (A) seems to be the correct answer as it mentions the so-called Lotus principle and explains that it means 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law'.\n\nThe highest-ranking court of a State is the Supreme Court, which is the final appellate court in the United States' federal court system, and is therefore not directly relevant to the question.\n\nThe answer to the question is:\n\n(A) The so-called Lotus principle is that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', or, as it has been construed, 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law'",

Instead, it is called an \"uncodified\" constitution, meaning that it is spread out across a range of sources, including legislation, common law, and conventions. These sources are often agreed upon and accepted by the government, courts, and citizens over time, and together form the basis for the UK's system of government. The fact that the UK constitution is uncodified makes it more flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances, but also makes it harder to know what the rules are in a given situation.",

            "model_answer": "The question asks about the obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes. To answer this question, we need to understand what peaceful settlement of disputes means in the context of international law.\n\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes refers to the process of resolving disputes between states through means other than the use of force. This can include negotiation, mediation, arbitration, and other forms of dispute resolution. It is an important principle of international law that states are expected to resolve their disputes peacefully.\n\nNow, to answer the question, we need to consider the different options and determine which one best describes the obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes.\n\nOption (A) says that it is an obligation of result, meaning that states are under a strict obligation to resolve their disputes as soon as possible. This is not the correct answer because there is no strict obligation on states to resolve their disputes. While states are expected to engage in the peaceful settlement of disputes, they are not necessarily required to reach a resolution.\n\nOption (B) says that it is an obligation of conduct, meaning that states have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means, but this does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes. This is a closer answer, but it does not fully capture the obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes. While states may not be required to reach a resolution, they are expected to engage in good faith negotiations and make a genuine effort to resolve their disputes peacefully.\n\nOption (C) says that it is a peremptory norm of international law and all states have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute. This is not the correct answer because while the peaceful settlement of disputes is an important principle of international law, it is not a peremptory norm. A peremptory norm is a fundamental principle of international law that is binding on all states and cannot be violated under any circumstances.\n\nOption (D) says that it is an oblig",

This definition is close to the correct one, as it mentions that rocks cannot sustain human habitation or economic life. However, it does not mention that a rock must be naturally formed or surrounded by water.\n\\par\nOption (D) states that rocks are small islands that can sustain human habitation. This definition is incorrect, as it implies that all small islands are rocks.
