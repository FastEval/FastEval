            "model_answer": "The answer to this question is not a single letter, but rather a percentage value. Therefore, the correct answer is one of the options presented in the question (A) through (D). To determine which of these options is correct, we need to determine the correct percentage value that corresponds to the given information in the question.\n\nAccording to the information in the question, we are being asked about the percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who are overweight. Without a specific country or population being specified, it is difficult to determine an exact percentage value. However, we can refer to global data on overweight and obesity prevalence among adults to get a general idea.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global prevalence of overweight and obesity in adults is approximately 60%. This value is an estimate based on data from 2014, and it is likely that the percentage has changed since then. However, it can serve as a rough reference point for assessing the accuracy of the given options in the question.\n\nNow, let's compare the given options to determine which one corresponds to the closest estimate of the global prevalence of overweight among adults.\n\n(A) 10%: This option is clearly too low, as it is only one-sixth of the global prevalence estimate of approximately 60%.\n\n(B) 20%: This option is closer to the global prevalence estimate, but it is still significantly lower. If we assume that the global prevalence has not changed significantly since 2014, then this option is only half of the estimated prevalence.\n\n(C) 40%: This option is closer to the global prevalence estimate than the previous ones, but it is still too low. If we again assume that the global prevalence has not changed significantly since 2014, then this option is only two-thirds of the estimated prevalence.\n\n(D) 80%: This option is significantly higher than the global prevalence estimate, but it is the closest among the given options. If we again assume that the global prevalence has not changed significantly since 2014, then this option is approximately 1.6 times the esti",

Since alternative (A) represents the lowest GDP per capita in 1850 for the United States whereas alternative (D) represents the highest, this confirms the validity of this assumption since alternative (A) is logically the alternative that represents the lowest standard of living.

            "model_answer": "Increase in GDP per capita can be a proxy for quality of life. But even if people live better (assuming we can capture that with GDP per capita) they can still be unhappy. If we want to maximize happiness it is not clear that improving standard of living (quality of life) is the most important factor. If a population is at risk for a pandemic - like COVID or even influenza - increasing their connection with others can be a more effective way to maximize happiness even if standard of living decreases. And in the case of COVID the outbreak likely led to a decrease in living standards. It is certainly possible that happiness was reduced as well but it is a more complex issue - not exceptions to a one dimensional rule. I can't argue that maximizing GDP per capita should never be a primary goal. But if we want to maximize happiness it is not exceptions to a one dimensional rule.

First, we need to understand what is meant by \"safe drinking water.\" The term refers to water that is free from contamination that could cause disease or harm to human health.\n2. Next, we need to look at data on global access to safe drinking water. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 2019, an estimated 2.2 billion people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water.\n3. To determine the percentage of the global population without access to safe drinking water, we need to divide the number of people without access by the total global population. As of 2019, the global population was approximately 7.7 billion people.\n4. Dividing 2.2 billion by 7.7 billion gives us a percentage of approximately 28.6%.\n5.
