A photographer is manipulating a digital image and overwriting the original image.

The new value of each pixel represents a shade of gray, ranging from white to black.\n\nThis is a lossless transformation because the original data is preserved, and the grayscale image is a new representation of the original color image. Averaging the RGB values of each pixel does not introduce any loss of information, and the result is a new image that is still a valid representation of the original image.",

Therefore, to print the first item from the tuple ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ), we would use the following syntax:\n\nprint tuple[0]\n\nThe [0] indexer refers to the first item in the tuple, which is the string 'abcd'.
