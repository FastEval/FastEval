            "model_answer": "(A) 1\n\nIn Python 3, the left shift operator (<<) performs zero-padding on the left side of the number. That means that the digital representation of the number 1 is shifted to the left by 3 positions, filling the empty spaces on the left with 0s in the process.\n\nSince the original digital representation of x was 1, which is a power of 2, there is no digital representation left other than 0 after the shift. Therefore, the result of x << 3 is:\n\n(D) 16",

            "model_answer": "Correct answer is:\nA) The file is broken into packets for transmission. The packets must be reassembled upon receipt.\n\nMy reasoning is:\n\n1. When a user requests a file from a web server, the server needs to send the file to the user's device.\n2. In order to send large files over the internet, the file needs to be broken down into smaller chunks or packets.\n3. These packets are then transmitted over the internet, and the receiving device reassembles them to form the original file.\n4. This process, commonly known as packet switching, is used by the internet to send data efficiently and quickly.\n5. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",

These include how much memory the program requires as it runs, how long the program takes to run, how many programming statements the program contains, and how much storage space the program requires as it runs.\n\nStep 2: Memory requirements are likely to impact the ability of the program to process large amounts of data the most since large data sets need to be stored in memory to be processed efficiently.\n\nStep 3: Program execution time is also an important factor because larger data sets take longer to process, and the ability to process large amounts of data depends on how quickly the program can complete its tasks.\n\nStep 4: The number of programming statements the program contains is not likely to impact the ability of the program to process large amounts of data since a program with more statements may simply be performing its tasks in greater detail.\n\nStep 5: Storage space requirements are unlikely to impact the ability of the program to process large amounts of data since large data sets need to be stored in memory to be processed efficiently, and the size of the program itself is separate from the amount of data it can process.\n\nStep 6: The answer is therefore option (B) How many programming statements the program contains.\n\nAnswer: (B)",
