            "question": "Suppose that an expansionary fiscal policy leads to a large increase in real output and a small increase in the price level. From this it can be inferred that\n\n(A) inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus.\n(B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n(C) aggregate supply decreased.\n(D) aggregate demand is steeply sloped.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n\nThe reason for this is that an expansionary fiscal policy is one in which government spending increases or taxes decrease, leading to an increase in aggregate demand and a thereby a increase in real output. If there is a small increase in the price level, it means that there was some unemployed resources in the economy initially, such as unemployment labor or capital, which were able to be employed due to the increase in aggregate demand. If there was no unemployed resources, the increase in aggregate demand would lead to inflation. The fact that there was only a small increase in the price level indicates that there was some excess capacity in the economy that was able to be utilized.",

Therefore it doesn't always raise the amount of the product sold domestically. So it's not a general rule.\n\n(C) is correct because tariffs and quotas can result in a lower quantity of the product sold domestically. It's a general rule that these policies can limit imports and quiet the domestic market.\n\n(D) is incorrect because tariffs and quotas can raise the prices of the product, which in turn may reduce the demand for the product.

When interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and vice versa.\n* Contractionary monetary policy is designed to reduce the supply of money and credit in the economy, which can lead to higher interest rates.\n* Expansionary monetary policy, on the other hand, is designed to increase the supply of money and credit in the economy, which can lead to lower interest rates.\n* A depreciating dollar can lead to higher import prices and potentially higher inflation, which can lead to higher interest rates and lower bond prices. However, this is not necessarily the case, as other factors can also influence the value of the dollar.\n* Fiscal policy designed to reduce the budget deficit can also lead to lower bond prices, but it is not a monetary policy and therefore does not fit the question.",
