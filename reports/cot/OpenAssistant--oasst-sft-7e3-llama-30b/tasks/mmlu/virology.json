            "question": "How many human polyomaviruses are known at present?\n\n(A) 100\n(B) 1\n(C) 10\n(D) unknown",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure, here is my answer step by step:\n\n1. The question asks how many human polyomaviruses are known at present. \"Known\" implies that someone has discovered or identified the viruses.\n2. The term \"polyomavirus\" refers to a family of small, non-enveloped viruses that infect animals and humans. There are several known human polyomaviruses, but not all of them have the same level of study or recognition.\n3. Options (A) 100, (B) 1, and (C) 10 suggest that there are specific numbers of human polyomaviruses that are widely recognized or well-established. However, these numbers seem rather extreme, especially compared to option (D) unknown.\n4. Given that this question is multiple choice, option (D) unknown might be a trap option, intended to confuse the test taker into choosing a more definitive answer. However, option (D) unknown could also be valid if there is currently ongoing research or debate about the number of human polyomaviruses.\n5. Before I make a decision, I would need to check the current literature or consensus about the number of human polyomaviruses. I suspect there is likely to be some uncertainty or debate in this area, so option (D) unknown is probably the safest answer given the information we have been provided.\n\nAnswer: (D) unknown",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is (C) Memory T cells.\n\nTo reach this conclusion, we can consider the following steps:\n\n1. Summarize the characteristics of the adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system is a crucial part of the immune response to infection, consisting of two major types of lymphocytes: B cells and T cells. B cells produce antibodies that recognize and neutralize pathogens, while T cells interact with other immune cells to help destroy infected or cancerous cells.\n2. Identify the unique features of the adaptive immune system among the given options. Options (A) and (D) are both characteristics of the adaptive immune system.\n3. Consider option (C) Memory T cells. Memory T cells are a type of T cell that \"remember\" previous infections and can rapidly respond to subsequent infections. This \"memory\" function allows the immune system to more quickly and effectively eliminate pathogens and protect against future infections.\n4. Determine that the ability of the immune system to remember previous infections is the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system. The other characteristics (A) and (D) are important for the functioning of the immune system, but the ability to remember previous infections and mount an effective and rapid response is unique to the adaptive immune system and is a key factor in human health.\n5. Output the answer as (C) with the explanation. Answer: (C) Memory T cells. The ability of the immune system to remember previous infections and mount a rapid and effective response is the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system.",
