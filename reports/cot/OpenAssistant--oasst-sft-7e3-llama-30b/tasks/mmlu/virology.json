Identify the key words or phrases, such as \"most deaths\", \"caused by\", and the options A, B, C, and D.\n3. Understand the meaning of each option. For example, option A \"Respiratory infections\" refers to infections that affect the respiratory system, such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Option B \"Diarrheal diseases\" refers to diseases that cause diarrhea, such as cholera and dysentery. Option C \"Malaria\" refers to a mosquito-borne disease that causes fever, headache, and vomiting. Option D \"Tuberculosis\" refers to a bacterial infection that mainly affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body.\n4. Search for data or statistics that support the most deaths caused by one of the options. Sources for such data can be reputable health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or the United Nations (UN). These organizations collect and publish data on causes of death worldwide.\n5. Analyze the data to identify which of the options has caused the most deaths globally. Be cautious of data that may not be up to date or may not be representative of the global population.\n6. Output the answer as a single letter with parenthesis, such as (A), (B), (C), or (D), indicating the option that caused the most deaths globally.\n\nTherefore, to answer the question step-by-step, one should follow the above steps to identify the correct option.",

This context implies that the best choice would be relevant to the resources available in these countries and the needs of the infants.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the options\n\n* (A) Exclusively formula fed for six months: Formula feeding requires clean water and a sterile environment for preparation, which may not be available in the given context. This option is unlikely to be the best choice.\n* (B) Exclusively breast fed for six months: Breastfeeding is considered the best choice for infants if possible, as it provides all the necessary nutrients and antibodies. Also, it does not require clean water or sterile environment, so it might be a good option in the given context.\n* (C) Should receive both breast milk and other foods as tolerated in the first 6 months: This option may not provide the infant with the necessary nutrients and antibodies during the first six months of life. It might not be the best choice considering the given context.\n* (D) months: None of the above options are suitable according to the context and the needs of the infants.\n\nStep 4: Choose the best answer\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the best option among the given choices is:\n\n(B) Exclusively breast fed for six months\n\nStep 5: Output the answer\n\nThe answer is:\n\n(B) Exclusively breast fed for six months",

They may be too ahead of their time for others to follow.\n\n(B) Early adapters are also quick to accept new ideas, but similarly, they may not be representative of the community at large.\n\n(C) Middle adapters are the largest group of people in the community who are open to adopting new ideas and practices. They are not the first to adopt, but they are not the last either. They are generally practical and considerate of others, making them more likely to promote change that benefits the community.\n\n(D) Late adapters are the last to accept new ideas and may be resistant to change.

It involves providing positive reinforcement, in the form of rewards or incentives, for engaging in desired behaviors.\n\nOption (D) is the correct answer. It states that \"paying drug users to use condoms\" is an example of contingency management. By providing a reward for using condoms, individuals are more likely to engage in safe sexual behavior, which can lead to a reduction in high-risk behaviors such as unprotected sex.\n\nOption (A) is not correct because contingency management is not a strategy of last resort. It is a widely recognized and effective therapeutic strategy that can be used in a variety of settings.\n\nOption (B) is not correct because paying drug users for negative urine specimens does not involve providing incentives for engaging in desired behaviors. Instead, it involves providing negative reinforcement for not engaging in drug use.\n\nOption (C) is not correct because paying sex workers to use condoms does not involve providing incentives for engaging in desired behaviors.

However, the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is its ability to form memory T cells.\n\nMemory T cells are a type of T cell that remember a specific pathogen and can provide a faster and stronger immune response if the pathogen is encountered again in the future. This is because memory T cells have the ability to differentiate into different types of T cells, such as effector T cells and effector memory T cells, which can quickly eliminate the pathogen from the body.\n\nTherefore, the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is its ability to form memory T cells, which allows it to provide a faster and stronger immune response to specific pathogens.",
