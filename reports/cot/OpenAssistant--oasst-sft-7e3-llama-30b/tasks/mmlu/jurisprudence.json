In what way?\n\n(A) It is misinterpreted as a prediction.\n(B) His concept of status is misrepresented.\n(C) It is taken literally.\n(D) His idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) His concept of status is misrepresented.\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* Maine's aphorism suggests that societies have moved from a focus on status to a focus on contract.\n* Status refers to a person's position in a social hierarchy, while contract refers to an agreement between parties.\n* The aphorism suggests that as societies progress, they move away from a focus on status and toward a focus on contract.\n* It is often misunderstood in that Maine's concept of status is misrepresented. Some may interpret his concept of status as a reference to a person's position in a hierarchical society, while others may interpret it more broadly as a reference to the social order itself.\n* However, Maine's concept of status goes beyond just a person's position in a social hierarchy or the social order as a whole. It involves a recognition of the existence of certain social relationships and obligations.\n* Therefore, the concept of status as used by Maine is often misrepresented or misunderstood, which affects the interpretation of his aphorism.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) The international recognition of human rights after World War II.\n\nThis option refers to the development of international human rights law after the end of World War II, which had a significant impact on the revival of natural law in the 20th century. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, drew heavily from natural law principles and helped to bring natural law ideas back into the mainstream of legal thought. Additionally, natural law ideas were also influential in the development of international human rights law and helped to shape the international legal order in the post-war period. Therefore, option (C) is the most relevant factor contributing to the revival of natural law in the 20th century.",

Rawls' theory of justice as fairness holds that individuals in the original position, where they are impartial and have no prior knowledge of their preferences or social status, would choose two principles of justice: the principle of equal basic liberties and the difference principle, which allows social and economic inequalities only if they benefit the least advantaged. Therefore, option (B) is the most consistent with what Rawls claims the POP would opt for in respect of 'social primary goods'.",

            "model_answer": "Firstly, let's consider Austin's argument that a sanction consists of the smallest chance of incurring the smallest evil. Based on this argument, we can conclude that a sanction is a necessary component of a command.\n\nNow, let's consider each statement one by one:\n\n(A) All commands include some sanction.\nThis statement logically follows from Austin's argument. If a sanction is necessary for a command, then all commands must include some sanction.\n\n(B) The concept of a command contains the likelihood that a sanction will follow failure to obey the command.\nThis statement also logically follows from Austin's argument. If a sanction is a necessary component of a command, then the likelihood of a sanction following failure to obey the command must be part of the concept of a command.\n\n(C) Without a sanction the mere expression of a wish is not a command.\nThis statement logically follows from Austin's argument. If a sanction is necessary for a command, then without a sanction, the mere expression of a wish cannot be considered a command.\n\n(D) A command confers power to change one's legal status.\nThis statement does not logically follow from Austin's argument. Austin's argument focuses on the necessity of a sanction in a command, but does not necessarily imply that a command confers power to change one's legal status.\n\nTherefore, the least likely to follow logically from Austin's argument that a sanction consists of the smallest chance of incurring the smallest evil is statement (D): A command confers power to change one's legal status.\n\nAnswer: D) A command confers power to change one's legal status.",
