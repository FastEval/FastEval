            "model_answer": "The common public relations tactic of sending journalists on visits to appropriate locations is called (B) Media tour. This tactic is used to give journalists firsthand experience of a place or event, so they can gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter and potentially write about it in a more informed way. The media tour may involve visiting a company's headquarters, a construction site, a new product launch, or other relevant locations, depending on the specific story being covered. It is a way to build relationships with journalists and provide them with the resources they need to produce accurate and engaging stories.",

            "question": "You are the vice president of public relations for a corporation that produces a well-known brand of food products. In the Albany, New York, market, one of your products has recently been found to have some contamination. While apparently not fatal, it has given a large number of consumers severe stomach cramps and other intestinal problems. The cause has been traced back to your product, which is sold throughout the nation. Your CEO wants to know what you would advise to keep the situation from becoming a public relations disaster. What should you recommend?\n\n(A) Quickly investigate to make certain your product is definitely the cause of the illness.\n(B) Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product.\n(C) Stop sales of the product in the Albany, New York, market and issue a recall for that product.\n(D) Issue a press release to the Albany, New York, market explaining how to treat the symptoms.",

            "model_answer": "(A) Quickly investigate to make certain your product is definitely the cause of the illness. This is the first step to take in order to determine the root cause of the problem. We need to find out if our product is indeed the cause of the illness, and if so, what specifically about the product is causing the problem. This will help us to take the appropriate action to address the issue.\n\n(B) Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product. This may be an overreaction at this time, as we have not yet determined if our product is the cause of the problem. We should first investigate the issue, and if it is determined that our product is causing the illness, then a recall may be necessary.\n\n(C) Stop sales of the product in the Albany, New York, market and issue a recall for that product. This is a reasonable step to take if our investigation shows that the product is indeed the cause of the illness and it is only affecting the Albany market. A recall would be appropriate in this case to ensure that no more people are affected by the product.\n\n(D) Issue a press release to the Albany, New York, market explaining how to treat the symptoms. This may not be the best course of action, as it does not address the root cause of the problem. It may also be seen as insensitive to the consumers who have been affected by the product. It is important to take action to address the problem, rather than just providing information on how to treat the symptoms.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, I would recommend option (A) as the first step to take in this situation.",

However, we should also consider the other options to be sure.\n\n(C) 1925 is also too early, as the BBC had not yet begun broadcasting radio at that time.\n\n(D) 1927 is potentially the correct answer, as this is the earliest year in which the BBC could have started broadcasting radio.
