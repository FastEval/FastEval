Evaluation is the process of assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of the organization's operations, in order to identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions about future actions. This evaluation may take the form of internal assessments, such as performance reviews and audits, or external assessments, such as customer feedback surveys and market research.\n\nWhile the planning models of Hendrix (2002), Kendall (1999), Merston (1963) and Parkinson and Ekachai (2006) may differ in their specific approaches to strategy development and evaluation, they all include these two elements as part of the overall planning process.
