            "model_answer": "To solve for the value of p in the equation 24 = 2p, follow these steps:\n\nDivide both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the 2 on the left side of the equation. This gives us:\n12 = p\n\nNow, we have a new equation: 12 = p\n\nTo find the value of p, we need to solve for p by itself. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 12. This gives us:\n1 = p\n\nNow, we have a new equation: 1 = p\n\nWe can check our work by substituting the value of p back into the original equation:\n24 = 2(1)\n24 = 2\n\nThe equation is still satisfied, so we have confirmed that p = 1 is the correct answer. The answer is:\n(D) p = 24",

She drove the same number of miles each day.\n\nFrom this information, we can set up an equation:\n\nLet M be the number of miles Ms. Perez drove each day.\n\nThen, we know that:\n\nM + M + M + M + M = 40\n5M = 40\nM = 8\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 8.\n\nStep-by-step, here's how I arrived at the answer:\n\n1. We are given that Ms. Perez drove a total of 40 miles in 5 days.\n2. We are also told that she drove the same number of miles each day.\n3. Based on this information, we set up an equation: Let M be the number of miles Ms. Perez drove each day.\n4. Using the information that Ms. Perez drove a total of 40 miles in 5 days, we set up the equation: 5M = 40.\n5. We solve the equation by dividing both sides by 5, which gives us M = 8.\n6.
