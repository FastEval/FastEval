Since the question mentions that she drove the same number of miles each day, we can assume that the miles were evenly distributed across the 5 days.\n\nTo simplify the problem, we can first calculate the average number of miles Ms. Perez drove per day by dividing the total number of miles by 5.\n\nMs. Perez drove a total of 40 miles in 5 days, so she drove an average of 40 miles / 5 days = 8 miles per day.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 8.",

To perform the division, we need to manipulate the numbers until they can be divided.\n3. We can rewrite 5.04 as 5 + 0.04 by adding a zero before the decimal point, making it easier to perform the division.\n4. Similarly, we can rewrite 0.7 as 0 + 0.7 by subtracting 0 from it, bringing it to the form of a regular decimal number:\n```markdown\n   5.04 \u00f7 0.7 = (5 + 0.04) \u00f7 (0 + 0.7)\n```\n1.
