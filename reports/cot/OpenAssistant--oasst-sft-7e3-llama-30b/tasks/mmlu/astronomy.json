            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Correct answer is (D) Its distance from you\n\nExplanation:\n\n* (A) Its speed relative to you: The brightness of an object does not directly provide information about its speed relative to the observer.\n* (B) Its composition: While the brightness of an object can provide some information about its composition, this information alone is not sufficient to determine the composition of an object.\n* (C) Its size: The brightness of an object does not provide direct information about its size.\n* (D) Its distance from you: The brightness of an object and its apparent brightness from a given location can be used to estimate the distance between the object and the observer, if the actual brightness of the object is known. This is because the apparent brightness of an object is inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the observer. (However, other factors such as the object's size and reflectivity can also affect its brightness and therefore the distance estimate).\n\nAnswer: (D) Its distance from you ( ).",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The sky is blue because of the way that sunlight interacts with the Earth's atmosphere.\n* When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it is made up of many different colors of light, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\n* These colors are all part of the visible light spectrum.\n* When the sunlight reaches the atmosphere, it is scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the air.\n* The short wavelengths of light (like blue and violet) are scattered more than the longer wavelengths (like red and orange), because the shorter wavelengths are easier to scatter.\n* This means that more of the blue light reaches our eyes from all directions, making the sky appear blue.\n* The other colors of light are scattered in other directions, which is why we don't see the sky as red or green, for example.\n' ' + answer + '\"')\n```css\n    return message\n```",

However, other moons, like Jupiter's Europa and Io, and Saturn's Enceladus, also show evidence of geologic activity. Therefore, (B) is not accurate.\n\nStep 3:\nConsider the pairings of statements.

Since Titan does have a thick atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen, (A) is true.\n\nStep 4:\nThe only remaining option that has not been confirmed to be false is (C).

Many of the Moon's rocks were formed during the early days of the solar system. Some were formed from lava that flowed, cooled and solidified, and others were made from the debris left from the impact of a large object with the Moon. Some were formed from a combination of these processes, so the Moon is like a museum of the processes that formed the early solar system.
