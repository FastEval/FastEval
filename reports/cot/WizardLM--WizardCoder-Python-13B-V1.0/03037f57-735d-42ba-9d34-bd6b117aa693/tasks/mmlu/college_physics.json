            "model_answer": "The most strongly reflected wavelength is (C) 600 nm. \n\nExplanation:\n\nThe index of refraction of the oil layer is 1.5, which means that light travels slower in the oil layer compared to the water layer. This means that the light will be more strongly reflected from the oil layer. The light will be reflected at the interface between the oil and water layers. The angle of reflection will depend on the angle of incidence and the index of refraction of the two media. The angle of incidence is 0 degrees, which means that the light is normal to the interface. The index of refraction of the water layer is 1.33, which means that the light will be reflected at an angle of 13.3 degrees. The light will be reflected at the same angle of incidence, which means that the reflected wavelength will be the same as the incident wavelength. \n\nThe wavelengths of light that are reflected from the oil layer are 600 nm, 650 nm, and 700 nm. The wavelengths of light that are reflected from the water layer are 500 nm, 550 nm, and 600 nm.

            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nThe harmonics produced by an organ pipe open at both ends are the frequencies that are produced when the pipe is struck. The first harmonic is the fundamental frequency of the pipe, which is the frequency at which the pipe is struck. The second harmonic is twice the fundamental frequency, the third harmonic is three times the fundamental frequency, and so on.\n\nWhen the pipe is closed at one end, the air inside the pipe will start to move towards the closed end, which will cause the frequency of the sound to change. The new frequency will be lower than the original frequency, and the harmonics produced will be lower as well.\n\nThe first harmonic will be the same as the original frequency, but the second harmonic will be lower by a factor of two, the third harmonic will be lower by a factor of three, and so on.\n\nThe harmonics that will survive once the pipe is closed at one end are the ones that are still above the cutoff frequency of the pipe. The cutoff frequency of the pipe is the frequency at which the air inside the pipe cannot move fast enough to produce a sound.\n\nThe cutoff frequency of the pipe depends on the length of the pipe and the air inside it. The longer the pipe, the lower the cutoff frequency. The thicker the walls of the pipe, the lower the cutoff frequency.\n\nIn this case, the first harmonic (50 Hz) will survive, as it is above the cutoff frequency. The second harmonic (100 Hz) will be lower than the cutoff frequency, so it will not survive. The third harmonic (150 Hz) will also be lower than the cutoff frequency, so it will not survive. The fourth harmonic (200 Hz) will also be lower than the cutoff frequency, so it will not survive. The fifth harmonic (250 Hz) will also be lower than the cutoff frequency, so it will not survive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only.",
