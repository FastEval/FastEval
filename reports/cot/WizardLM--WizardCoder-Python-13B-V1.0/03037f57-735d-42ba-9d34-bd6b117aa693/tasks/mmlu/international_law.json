            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nDo individuals (physical) persons enjoy international legal personality in the same manner as States and international organisations?\n\nIndividuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited.\n\nReasoning:\n\nIndividuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited because they can only enjoy limited international legal personality. This is because they are not considered as a separate legal entity, but rather as a natural person. They cannot be sued or held liable for any actions they take, but rather they can only be held liable for their actions through their employer or through their legal guardian.\n\nTherefore, individuals enjoy limited international legal personality, but they can only bring claims before international courts.",

            "model_answer": "The 'living instrument principle' is a legal principle that states that a treaty or other legal instrument should be interpreted in the light of its purpose and the circumstances in which it was made. It is a principle that is applied by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in its judgments.\n\nCase (A) Golder v UK (1978) illustrates the 'living instrument principle' well. In this case, the ECtHR held that the UK's policy of interning suspected terrorists without charge was in violation of Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The ECtHR held that the UK's policy was arbitrary and discriminatory, and that it violated the right to a fair trial. The ECtHR also held that the UK's policy was inconsistent with the UK's obligations under the ECHR.\n\nCase (B) A v UK (2009) also illustrates the 'living instrument principle' well. In this case, the ECtHR held that the UK's policy of detaining suspected terrorists without charge was in violation of Article 5 of the ECHR. The ECtHR held that the UK's policy was arbitrary and discriminatory, and that it violated the right to a fair trial. The ECtHR also held that the UK's policy was inconsistent with the UK's obligations under the ECHR.\n\nCase (C) Goodwin v UK (2002) illustrates the 'living instrument principle' well.

The Kadi judgment required that important UNSC resolutions be transformed and not merely incorporated.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the answer:\n\n1. The ICJ was not hostile to the accumulation theory: The ICJ has not explicitly stated that it is hostile to the accumulation theory. However, the ICJ has not explicitly stated that it is in favor of the accumulation theory either. Therefore, it is unclear whether the ICJ is hostile to the accumulation theory or not.\n\n2. The concept of an armed attack refers to a single attack, not multiple smaller instances of armed force: The concept of an armed attack refers to a single instance of armed force that results in death or serious injury to civilians. The accumulation theory refers to a series of lower intensity, yet cumulative, instances of armed force that may lead to an armed attack. Therefore, the concept of an armed attack does not refer to multiple smaller instances of armed force.\n\n3. In the Nicaragua case the ICJ dismissed the accumulation theory: In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ dismissed the accumulation theory because it did not meet the requirements of customary international law. The ICJ found that the cumulative instances of armed force did not constitute an armed attack.\n\n4. The ICJ has never addressed this issue: The ICJ has not explicitly addressed this issue in any of its judgments. Therefore, it is unclear whether the ICJ has ever addressed this issue or not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C).",
