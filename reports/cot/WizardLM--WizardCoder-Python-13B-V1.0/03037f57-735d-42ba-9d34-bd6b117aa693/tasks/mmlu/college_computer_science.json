A Turing machine can accept a language if there exists a Turing machine that halts on all strings in the language.\n2. A pushdown automaton can accept a language if there exists a pushdown automaton that halts on all strings in the language.\n3. A context-free grammar can accept a language if there exists a context-free grammar that generates all strings in the language.\n\nNow, let's consider each of these properties in turn:\n\n1. A Turing machine can accept a language if there exists a Turing machine that halts on all strings in the language.\n\nTo determine whether the language {ww | w in (0 + 1)*} is accepted by any Turing machine, we can construct a Turing machine that halts on all strings in the language.\n\nWe can do this by simulating the following algorithm:\n\n1. Start at the leftmost symbol of the input string.\n2. If the symbol is a 0, move the head one step to the right and write a 1.\n3. If the symbol is a 1, move the head one step to the right and write a 0.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the head reaches the right end of the input string.\n5. Accept the input string.\n\nThis algorithm will correctly simulate the transformation of the input string into the language {ww | w in (0 + 1)*} and will halt on all strings in the language.

Start at the leftmost symbol of the input string.\n2. If the symbol is a 0, push a 1 onto the stack and move the head one step to the right.\n3. If the symbol is a 1, push a 0 onto the stack and move the head one step to the right.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the head reaches the right end of the input string.\n5. If the stack is empty, accept the input string.\n\nThis algorithm will correctly simulate the transformation of the input string into the language {ww | w in (0 + 1)*} and will halt on all strings in the language.

Start with the string \"0\".\n2. Replace all occurrences of \"0\" with \"01\" and all occurrences of \"1\" with \"10\".\n3. Repeat step 2 until the string is of the form \"ww\".\n\nThis algorithm will correctly simulate the transformation of the input string into the language {ww | w in (0 + 1)*} and will generate all strings in the language.

Therefore, recursive procedures require stack-based storage allocation, which is not possible with static allocation.\n\nStatic allocation is when memory is allocated at compile time and does not change during program execution.

Let (u, v) be an edge in G that is not in T, such that pre(u) < pre(v).\n\nStatement I: post(u) < post(v)\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis statement is false.
