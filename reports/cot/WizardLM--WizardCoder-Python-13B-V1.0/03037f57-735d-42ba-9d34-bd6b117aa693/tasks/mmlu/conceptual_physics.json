            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) All of these. \n\nExplanation: \n\nLight leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity because it is affected by the curvature of space-time caused by the Sun's mass. This is predicted by the general theory of relativity. \n\nLight passing the Sun is deflected because it follows the curvature of space-time caused by the Sun's mass. This is also predicted by the general theory of relativity. \n\nA clock on the Sun's surface runs faster than on Earth because the Sun's gravity is stronger than Earth's gravity, so the Sun's gravitational field is stronger. This means that the Sun's gravitational field exerts a stronger force on the clock, which causes it to tick faster. \n\nTherefore, all of these statements are true.",

This is because the beta particle is a type of electron that is ejected from the nucleus of the atom. The atomic number of the atom is the number of protons in the nucleus, and when an electron is ejected, one of the protons is no longer present in the nucleus, so the atomic number of the atom decreases by 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).",

The complementary color of a primary color is the color opposite it on the color wheel. In this case, blue is opposite magenta, which is the color opposite it on the color wheel.

This is because the speed of sound is the maximum speed at which a sound wave can travel through the air without being distorted. When an aircraft flies faster than the speed of sound, the sound wave that is produced by the aircraft becomes distorted and creates a sonic boom.\n\nTherefore, all the options (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they do not describe the situation when an aircraft produces a sonic boom. The correct option is (D) because it states that all of these situations produce a sonic boom.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) All of these about equally. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nWhen a fusion reaction converts a pair of hydrogen isotopes to an alpha particle and a neutron, most of the energy released is in the form of gamma radiation, kinetic energy of the alpha particle, and kinetic energy of the neutron. However, the energy released in each of these forms is not equal. \r\n\r\nGamma radiation is the most energetic form of energy released in a fusion reaction. It is responsible for most of the energy released in the reaction. \r\n\r\nThe kinetic energy of the alpha particle is also significant. The alpha particle is a helium nucleus that is ejected from the fusion reaction. The kinetic energy of the alpha particle is responsible for the majority of the energy released in the reaction. \r\n\r\nThe kinetic energy of the neutron is the least significant form of energy released in a fusion reaction. The neutron is a subatomic particle that is ejected from the fusion reaction. The kinetic energy of the neutron is responsible for a small portion of the energy released in the reaction. \r\n\r\nTherefore, it can be said that all of these forms of energy released in a fusion reaction are about equally significant.",
