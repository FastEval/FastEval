The ball\u2019s speed is zero at the highest point.\nII. The ball\u2019s acceleration is zero at the highest point.\nIII.

            "model_answer": "I. The ball's speed is zero at the highest point.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe ball's speed is zero at the highest point because there is no horizontal movement at this point. The only movement is vertical, which means the speed is zero.\n\nII. The ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point because there is no horizontal movement, which means there is no change in speed. Therefore, the acceleration is zero.\n\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis statement is false because the time taken to reach the highest point and fall back down is the same. The reason is that the ball is subjected to the same forces of gravity and air resistance throughout its motion. Therefore, the time taken to reach the highest point and fall back down is the same.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) I & III only.",
