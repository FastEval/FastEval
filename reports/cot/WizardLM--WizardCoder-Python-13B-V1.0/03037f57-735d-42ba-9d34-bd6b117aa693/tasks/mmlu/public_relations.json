            "correct_answer": 3,

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The most effective form of communication in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue is interpersonal communication. This is because interpersonal communication involves direct communication between individuals, which allows for a more personalized approach to influencing attitudes and behaviors. Media and group communication, on the other hand, are less effective in forming or changing predispositions because they are less personalized and rely on mass communication, which can have a more generalized effect on attitudes and behaviors. Additionally, public communication is less effective because it relies on a more impersonal approach, which may not be as effective in forming or changing predispositions as interpersonal communication. Therefore, the most effective form of communication in forming or changing predispositions is interpersonal communication.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Normative. \n\nExplanation: \n\nThe term \"publics\" refers to the people or groups that an organization relies on for support or assistance. Esman (1972) defines publics as \"the groups or individuals who have a stake in the organization's existence and who provide it with authority or assistance.\" \n\nThe term \"normative\" refers to the authority or assistance that an organization relies on from a set of rules or norms. These rules or norms are typically set by a governing body or organization, such as a government or a professional association. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Normative, as this is the type of publics that provide an organization with authority or assistance through the set of rules or norms they establish.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is (B) democracy, dialogic.\n\nBakhtin's concept of dialogic communication refers to the idea that all communication should be two-way, or a dialogue, rather than one-way, or monologue. This is because dialogic communication allows for a more informed and engaged public, as they are able to participate in the conversation and contribute their own ideas and perspectives.\n\nTherefore, in order to create a well-informed public, all communication about an issue must be dialogic, or take the form of a dialogue.",

            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nThe question is asking us to compare and contrast the current thinking on mass communication and the early theories. The early theories suggested that audiences were passive recipients of media messages and thus vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nThe current thinking is that audiences are more active and engaged with media messages. This is because of the increased use of technology, such as social media, which allows for more active participation in media consumption. Additionally, the right hemisphere of the brain is more active in television viewing, which can lead to increased activity in the brain.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is (D) because it suggests that technology has led to increasingly passive recipients at the ends of message transmission systems. This is because technology has made it easier for people to consume media messages without being actively engaged in the process.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The main purpose of licensing public relations practitioners is to regulate access to posts in the field. This is because licensing ensures that only qualified practitioners are allowed to work in the field, ensuring that the public is protected from unqualified practitioners. Additionally, licensing also ensures that practitioners are held accountable for their actions and are held to a higher standard of ethics and professionalism. This helps to preserve the well-being of society by ensuring that the public is protected from unscrupulous practitioners. Finally, licensing also helps to achieve better wages for licensed practitioners, as it ensures that only qualified practitioners are working in the field, leading to higher demand and higher wages for licensed practitioners.
