            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\n(A) Reason is a key element because it is a sin for humans not to apply reason. Reason is the ability to use logic and critical thinking to analyze and understand the world around us. It is essential for humans to use reason to make decisions, solve problems, and understand the laws of nature. Not using reason can lead to irrational decisions and actions, which can have negative consequences for individuals and society as a whole.\n\n(B) Reason is a key element because the principles of natural law are discoverable by reason. Natural law is the set of principles that govern human behavior and relationships with other living beings. These principles are based on the idea that humans are part of nature and that humans should act in a way that is consistent with the laws of nature. Reason can be used to discover these principles, which can then be used as a basis for positive law.\n\n(C) Reason is a key element because natural law does not apply without good reason. Natural law is a set of principles that govern human behavior and relationships with other living beings. These principles are based on the idea that humans are part of nature and that humans should act in a way that is consistent with the laws of nature. Reason is necessary to determine whether or not a particular action or behavior is consistent with natural law.\n\n(D) Reason is a key element because the law of nature is the basis of all positive law. The law of nature is the set of principles that govern human behavior and relationships with other living beings.

It is the body of formal, general rules that control the state and the economy. These rules are presented in simplified terms and are often communicated through the media. \n\n'Law as institution' inhabits the 'lifeworld' and expresses its shared values and norms in institutional form. This refers to the courts, which are the formal institutions that enforce the law. \n\nThe distinction between 'law as medium' and 'law as institution' is important because it highlights the tension between the formal and the informal aspects of law. The former is the rule-based system that is enforced by the courts, while the latter is the shared values and norms that are expressed in the lifeworld.",
