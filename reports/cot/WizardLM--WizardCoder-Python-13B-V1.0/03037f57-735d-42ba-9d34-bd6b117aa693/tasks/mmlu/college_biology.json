It is made up of cells that are responsible for maintaining the structure and function of the body. \n\nGlycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a type of glycoprotein that are found in connective tissue. They are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the extracellular matrix, which is the supportive tissue that gives structure to the body. \n\nThrombin is a protein that is found in the blood and is responsible for clotting. It is not found in connective tissue. \n\nCollagens are proteins that are found in connective tissue and are responsible for maintaining the structure of the tissue. \n\nFibroblasts are cells that are found in connective tissue and are responsible for producing collagen. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) because it is the only option that is found in connective tissue and is not thrombin, which is not found in connective tissue.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A).\n\nExplanation:\n\nAn inhibitor of an enzyme can have several mechanisms of action. The most common one is by irreversibly forming covalent links with the enzyme, effectively preventing the enzyme's dissociation from it. This is because the inhibitor prevents the enzyme from being able to perform its catalytic function, which is to break down the substrate molecule into products. Therefore, the inhibitor prevents the substrate from binding to the enzyme, and the enzyme cannot perform its function.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).",
