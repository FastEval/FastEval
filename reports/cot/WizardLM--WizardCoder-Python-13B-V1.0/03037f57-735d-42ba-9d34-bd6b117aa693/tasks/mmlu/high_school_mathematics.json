This means that the rectangle has a width of $3$ units and a height of $2$ units.\n\nNext, we need to determine the probability of picking a point $(x,y)$ such that $x < y$. This can be done by considering the area of the rectangle that satisfies this condition.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is $6$ square units. We need to find the area of the triangle that satisfies the condition $x < y$. This can be done by considering the triangle formed by the points $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, and $(0,2)$. This triangle has a base of $3$ units and a height of $2$ units, so its area is $3 \\times 2 = 6$ square units.

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply some mathematical operations. Here's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles.\n2. The two piles had an equal number of pins.\n3. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.\n4. John had 66 pins left.\n\nNow, we need to find the original number of pins that John had. Let's start by finding the number of pins in one pile.\n\n5. We know that the two piles had an equal number of pins.\n6. Therefore, the number of pins in one pile is the same as the number of pins in the other pile.\n7. Let's call this number of pins in one pile as 'x'.\n\nNow, let's find the number of pins in the pile that John gave to his brother.\n\n8. We know that John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.\n9. Therefore, the number of pins in the pile that John gave to his brother is one-half of one-third of 'x'.\n10. Let's call this number of pins in the pile that John gave to his brother as 'y'.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of pins that John had.\n\n11. We know that John had 66 pins left.\n12. Therefore, the total number of pins that John had is 'x' + 'y' + 66.\n13. Let's call this total number of pins as 'z'.\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of 'x', 'y', and 'z' in the equation 'x' + 'y' + 66 to find the original number of pins that John had.\n\n14. 'x' + 'y' + 66 = 'z'\n15. 'x' + 'y' = 'z' - 66\n16. 'x' + 'y' = 'z' - 66\n17. 'x' = ('z' - 66) - 'y'\n18. 'x' = 'z' - 66 - 'y'\n\nNow, we need to find the value of 'y'.\n\n19. We know that the number of pins in the pile that John gave to his brother is one-half of one-third of 'x'.\n20. Therefore, 'y' = one-half of one-third of 'x'.\n21. Let's call this value of 'y' as 'w'.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of 'w' in the equation 'x' = 'z' - 66 - 'w' to find the original number of pins that John had.\n\n22. 'x' = 'z' - 66 - 'w'\n23. 'x' = 'z' - 66 - one-half of one-third of 'x'\n24. 'x' = 'z' - 66 - one-half of one-third of 'x'\n25. 2*'x' = 'z' - 66\n26. 2*'x' = 'z' - 66\n27. 'x' = ('z' - 66) / 2\n28. 'x' = 'z' / 2 - 33\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of 'x' in the equation 'x' + 'y' + 66 to find the original number of pins that John had.\n\n29. 'x' + 'y' + 66 = 'z'\n30. 'x' + 'y' = 'z' - 66\n31. 'x' + 'y' = 'z' - 66\n32. 'x' = ('z' - 66) - 'y'\n33. 'x' = 'z' - 66 - 'y'\n34. 'x' = 'z' / 2 - 33 - 'y'\n\nNow, we need to find the value of 'y'.\n\n35. We know that the number of pins in the pile that John gave to his brother is one-half of one-third of 'x'.\n36. Therefore, 'y' = one-half of one-third of 'x'.\n37. Let's call this value of 'y' as 'w'.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of 'w' in the equation 'x' = 'z' / 2 - 33 - 'w' to find the original number of pins that John had.\n\n38. 'x' = 'z' / 2 - 33 - 'w'\n39. 'x' = ('z' / 2 - 33) - 'w'\n40. 'x' = 'z' / 2 - 33 - 'w'\n41. 'x' = 'z' / 2 - 33 - one-half of one-third of 'x'\n42.
