            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The onset of labor is first triggered by hormones secreted by the Mother's ovaries. These hormones are responsible for regulating the menstrual cycle and preparing the uterus for implantation. The hypothalamus also plays a role in regulating the menstrual cycle and the timing of labor. The adrenal gland is responsible for producing hormones that regulate the body's response to stress, including the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are hormones that are released during labor and play a role in regulating the contractions of the uterus. The placenta and uterus also secret prostaglandins during labor, which further contribute to the onset of labor. Therefore, the answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) The follicular phase. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nThe shedding of the inner lining of the uterus is a normal process that occurs during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. During this phase, the follicle develops and matures, and the lining of the uterus is shed to make way for the implantation of the fertilized egg. The shedding of the lining is what causes menstruation. The shedding of the lining is also a sign that ovulation has occurred, but it is not the only sign of ovulation. The shedding of the lining is also a sign that the luteal phase has begun, but it is not the only sign of the luteal phase. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) The follicular phase.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C). \n\nExplanation: \n\nThe environment for sperm passage is most hospitable just at ovulation. This is because during ovulation, the fallopian tubes are filled with a thick, sticky mucus that allows the sperm to swim through them and reach the uterus. This is not the case during preovulation, proliferation, or menstruation.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) progesterone. \n\nExplanation: \n\nSterilization inhibits the production of estrogen and progesterone in the female reproductive system.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C). \r\n\r\nTo find the length of the embryo, we need to use the formula:\r\n\r\nLength = 2 x Diameter x \u03c0\r\n\r\nwhere Length is the length of the embryo, Diameter is the diameter of the embryo, and \u03c0 is the mathematical constant pi (approximately equal to 3.14).\r\n\r\nAt 28 days after conception, the embryo is approximately 12 millimetres in diameter. Therefore, the length of the embryo can be calculated using the formula:\r\n\r\nLength = 2 x 12 x \u03c0\r\nLength = 2 x 3.14 x 12\r\nLength = 65.61\r\n\r\nTherefore, the embryo is approximately 65.61 centimetres long. Since the answer is a single-digit number, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 65 centimetres. Therefore, the answer is (C).",
