However, it is generally accepted that the risk of untreated phenylketonuria is low.\n\nStep 3: Determine the probability of the outcome\nThe probability of the child having an abnormality is dependent on the mother's phenylketonuria status. If the mother has untreated phenylketonuria, the probability of the child having an abnormality is higher.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the probability of the outcome\nAssuming that the mother has untreated phenylketonuria, the probability of the child having an abnormality can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nP(A) = P(B) * P(A|B)\n\nWhere:\nP(A) = Probability of the child having an abnormality\nP(B) = Probability of the mother having untreated phenylketonuria\nP(A|B) = Probability of the child having an abnormality given that the mother has untreated phenylketonuria\n\nStep 5: Calculate the probability of the mother having untreated phenylketonuria\nAssuming that the probability of untreated phenylketonuria is low, the probability of the mother having untreated phenylketonuria can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(B) = 1 - P(B')\n\nWhere:\nP(B') = Probability of the mother not having untreated phenylketonuria\n\nStep 6: Calculate the probability of the child having an abnormality given that the mother has untreated phenylketonuria\nThe probability of the child having an abnormality given that the mother has untreated phenylketonuria is generally accepted to be high. Therefore, the probability of the child having an abnormality given that the mother has untreated phenylketonuria can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(A|B) = 0.9\n\nStep 7: Calculate the probability of the child having an abnormality\nUsing the formula from step 4, the probability of the child having an abnormality can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(A) = P(B) * P(A|B)\n\nP(A) = (1 - P(B')) * 0.9\n\nStep 8: Calculate the probability of the mother not having untreated phenylketonuria\nAssuming that the probability of untreated phenylketonuria is low, the probability of the mother not having untreated phenylketonuria can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(B') = 1 - P(B)\n\nP(B') = 1 - (1 - P(B'))\n\nStep 9: Calculate the probability of the child having an abnormality\nUsing the formula from step 4, the probability of the child having an abnormality can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(A) = P(B) * P(A|B)\n\nP(A) = (1 - P(B')) * 0.9\n\nP(A) = 0.9\n\nTherefore, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria is approximately 90%.",

This means that it is used to identify the genetic basis of a trait, such as height, weight, or color, in a cross of animals or plants. The analysis involves identifying the QTL (quantitative trait locus) that is responsible for the trait, and then mapping the QTL to a specific chromosome region. This can be done using genetic markers, such as microsatellites or restriction enzyme digests, to identify the QTL and its location on the chromosome. Once the QTL is identified, it can be used to isolate the genetic material responsible for the trait and study it in more detail.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C). \n\nExplanation: \n\nLeber's hereditary optic atrophy is a genetic eye disease that is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the protein retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (Rdh). This protein is responsible for the production of retinaldehyde, a compound that is essential for the proper functioning of the retina. \n\nThe mutation in the Rdh gene is located on chromosome 21, which is the chromosome that encodes the genes responsible for the production of proteins involved in the metabolism of lipids, cholesterol, and fatty acids. This mutation causes the production of an abnormal form of the Rdh protein, which leads to the accumulation of retinaldehyde in the retina, causing the degeneration of the retina and the development of Leber's hereditary optic atrophy. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) because the mutation in Leber's hereditary optic atrophy is located on chromosome 21.",
