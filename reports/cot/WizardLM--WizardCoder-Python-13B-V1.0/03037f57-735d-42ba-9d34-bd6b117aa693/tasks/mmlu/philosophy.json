It is a complex field that involves many different factors, including genetics, environment, and social context. It is difficult to isolate the role of the brain in individual behavior.\n\n(B) Controlled studies are not a reliable source of evidence for psychological egoism. They can be biased or manipulated, and they may not be representative of the broader population.\n\n(C) Interviews and surveys are not a reliable source of evidence for psychological egoism. They can be subjective and biased, and they may not be representative of the broader population.\n\n(D) Nonempirical arguments are not a reliable source of evidence for psychological egoism.

Immorality is the practice of doing what is wrong and unjust.\n\nExpediency is the practice of doing what is best for the present situation, regardless of the long-term consequences.\n\nIn this context, Cicero is saying that immorality is not in accord with Nature, because it is the opposite of morality, which is in accord with Nature.
