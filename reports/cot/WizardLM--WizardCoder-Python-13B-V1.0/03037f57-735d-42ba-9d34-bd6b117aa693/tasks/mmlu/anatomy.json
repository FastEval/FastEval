            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C).\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe bilateral cleft palate is a congenital malformation of the palate that occurs during development. It is caused by the failure of the fusion of the palatine processes, frontonasal processes, secondary nasal processes, and mandibular processes.\n\nThe palatine process is the part of the palate that is located in front of the nose. The frontonasal process is the part of the palate that is located in front of the nasal cavity. The secondary nasal process is the part of the palate that is located behind the nasal cavity. The mandibular processes are the parts of the palate that are located on the lower jaw.\n\nIn the case of a bilateral cleft palate, the failure of the fusion of all these processes results in the separation of the palate into two halves. This condition is known as a complete bilateral cleft palate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) because the failure of fusion of the palatine, frontonasal, and secondary nasal processes is responsible for the complete bilateral cleft palate.",

It is located in the pelvic cavity and is responsible for the transport of eggs from the ovary to the uterus. During ovulation, the eggs are released from the ovary and travel through the fallopian tube to the uterus. \n\nThe spermatozoon enters the ovum through the fallopian tube and fuses with the egg to form a zygote.

The mucosa is a thin layer of tissue that covers the alveolar process and is responsible for protecting the teeth and gums. It is light pink in colour because it is a healthy tissue that is not inflamed or diseased.

It is a benign condition that occurs in approximately 10% of the population. \r\n\r\nThe synchondrosis can be reactivated in patients affected by acromegaly, a condition in which the growth of the bones and skull is accelerated. In acromegaly, the growth of the skull and bones can cause the viscerocranium (the part of the brain that controls the viscera) to shift out of position, causing symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain. Reactivation of the synchondrosis in acromegaly can help to restore the position of the viscerocranium and alleviate these symptoms. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).",
