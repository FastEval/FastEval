            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry is France. \n\nExplanation: \n\nFrance is the least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry because it relies heavily on imports for its energy needs. France imports 90% of its oil and 80% of its natural gas. France also relies heavily on imports for its food needs, importing 70% of its food. France also relies heavily on imports for its industrial materials, importing 80% of its steel and 70% of its copper. \n\nIn contrast, the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom are all self-sufficient in their natural resources needed for modern industry. The United States is the most self-sufficient, with 95% of its energy needs met by domestic sources, including 100% of its oil and natural gas. Japan is also self-sufficient in its energy needs, with 90% of its energy needs met by domestic sources, including 100% of its oil and natural gas. The United Kingdom is also self-sufficient in its energy needs, with 85% of its energy needs met by domestic sources, including 100% of its oil and natural gas. \n\nTherefore, France is the least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) innovative diffusion.\n\nExplanation:\n\nInnovative diffusion is a type of diffusion that occurs when a new idea or product is introduced into a society. It is characterized by the diffusion of the new idea or product through a network of individuals who are willing to try out the new product or idea. The individuals who are willing to try out the new product or idea are known as innovators. The innovators then spread the new idea or product to other individuals who are also willing to try out the new product or idea. This process continues until the new idea or product becomes widely accepted and becomes a part of the mainstream culture.",

This means that the development of a region is not independent of the development of other regions.\n\nStatement (C) states that growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery. This statement contradicts the theory of cumulative causation because it suggests that the development of the core is not influenced by the development of other regions. Therefore, this statement is not part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation.",

In fact, world cities are found all over the world, including in the southern and eastern hemispheres. Therefore, (D) is not a characteristic of world cities.\n\nThe other three options are all characteristics of world cities. World cities contain the headquarters of many transnational corporations, are well connected to secondary-level world cities, and contain many offices of multinational organizations. Therefore, none of these options are not a characteristic of world cities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) agglomeration. \n\nExplanation: \n\nThe concentration of production activities and people spatially to benefit everyone is called agglomeration. \n\nAgglomeration is the process of clustering people and resources together in a densely populated area, which leads to economic benefits such as lower transportation costs, increased access to jobs and services, and better quality of life. \n\nIn contrast, deglomeration refers to the process of dispersing people and resources in order to reduce congestion and improve air quality. \n\nThe substitution principle is a concept in economics that refers to the replacement of one good or service with another. It is not related to the spatial concentration of people and resources. \n\nThe term infrastructure is also not related to the spatial concentration of people and resources. Infrastructure refers to the physical and social systems that support economic activity and the provision of essential services such as transportation, communication, and energy.",

Periphery countries are countries that are not considered to be developed or industrialized. \n2. Secondary activities are those that are considered to be less productive and less skilled than primary activities. \n3. Therefore, the majority of workers in periphery countries are likely to be employed in secondary activities. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Secondary.",
