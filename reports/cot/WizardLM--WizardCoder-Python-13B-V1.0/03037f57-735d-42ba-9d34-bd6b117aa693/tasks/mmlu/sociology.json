However, option (C) is the only one that is specifically identified as a sociological community.\n\nA sociological community is a group of people who share a common interest or experience, such as a hobby or a shared past experience. These communities are formed by people who share a common interest or experience, rather than by shared identity or experiences of discrimination.\n\nTherefore, option (C) is the only option that is specifically identified as a sociological community, and not any of the other options.",

This is because men were more likely to take on more housework when they had more time-saving devices to help them. Additionally, the study found that men were more likely to take on more housework when they were unemployed or both partners worked full time, as they had more time on their hands. However, the other three options do not directly relate to the proportion of housework men done, as they are not factors that affect the amount of housework men do.

This definition is based on the fact that the working class is exploited by their employers, who use their labour to generate profit. The working class is not able to control their own economic resources and are forced to work for the capitalist employers. This exploitation is the class situation that Weber was referring to.",

Observing people outside of their natural setting can cause them distress and anxiety, as they may feel uncomfortable and exposed. This can lead to them being less open and honest in their responses, which can skew the results of the study. Additionally, covert participant observation can be difficult to conduct, as it requires the researcher to blend in with the environment and not be noticed. This can be challenging and can lead to the researcher deceiving the respondents as to the reason for their presence. Finally, covert participant observation can also subject the participants to physical harm, as they may feel uncomfortable or threatened by the researcher's presence.",
