            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt a meeting of working girls held at Hull House during a strike in a large shoe factory, the discussions made it clear that the strikers who had been most easily frightened, and therefore the first to capitulate, were naturally those girls who were paying board and were afraid of being put out if they fell too far behind. After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nThe perspective of the passage above would most directly support which of the following political goals?\n\n(A) Women's suffrage\n(B) Trust-busting\n(C) Greater rights for unions\n(D) Weakening political machines",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The challenge of the next half century is whether we have the wisdom to use wealth to enrich and elevate our national life, and to advance the quality of our American civilization\u2026.The Great Society rests on abundance and liberty for all. It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nAll of the following were part of Johnson's Great Society program EXCEPT\n\n(A) the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n(B) Medicare and Medicaid\n(C) the establishment of the Department of Housing and Urban Development\n(D) the balanced budget mandate",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C).\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was established in 1965 as part of the Great Society program to provide affordable housing and community development. It was created to address the problem of poverty and racial segregation in the United States. The program also included the creation of the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), which was established to provide economic opportunities for minorities and women.\n\nThe other three choices were not part of the Great Society program, but were part of the Johnson administration's efforts to address the problems of poverty and racial injustice. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed to end racial segregation in public facilities, and Medicare and Medicaid were created to provide healthcare for the elderly and the poor. The balanced budget mandate was a requirement that all federal spending be balanced, which was not part of the Great Society program.",
