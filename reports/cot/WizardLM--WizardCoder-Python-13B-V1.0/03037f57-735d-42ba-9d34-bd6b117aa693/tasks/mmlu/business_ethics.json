            "question": "There are two main issues associated with _____ sizing. _______ is a key issue as due to the information policy of the corporation it can be argued that employees have a right to know if they are being made redundant. _______ is a second issue, particularly the ________ package that employees receive when laid off.\n\n(A) Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation\n(B) Up, Involvement, Autonomy, Compensation\n(C) Down, Autonomy, Remuneration, Benefit\n(D) Up, Independence, Involvement, Benefit",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Up, Involvement, Autonomy, Compensation.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe first issue associated with sizing is downsizing, which means reducing the size of the organization. The second issue is involvement, which refers to the level of involvement of employees in the decision-making process.\n\nThe key issue is that employees have a right to know if they are being made redundant, which is a concern for the corporation. This is because the information policy of the corporation may be in violation of the employee's right to know.\n\nThe second issue is autonomy, which refers to the level of autonomy that employees have in their work. This is a concern because the package that employees receive when laid off may not be sufficient to cover their needs.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) Up, Involvement, Autonomy, Compensation because it addresses both issues in a positive way. The first issue is addressed by suggesting that the size of the organization should be increased, which is the opposite of the downsizing issue. The second issue is addressed by suggesting that employees should have more involvement in decision-making, which is the opposite of the low involvement issue. The third issue is addressed by suggesting that employees should have more autonomy in their work, which is the opposite of the low autonomy issue. The fourth issue is addressed by suggesting that employees should receive more compensation, which is the opposite of the low remuneration issue.",
