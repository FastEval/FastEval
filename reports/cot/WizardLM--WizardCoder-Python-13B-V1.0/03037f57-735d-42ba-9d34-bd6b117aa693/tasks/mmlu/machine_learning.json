A larger number of hidden nodes allows for more complex relationships to be learned, but also increases the risk of overfitting. On the other hand, a smaller number of hidden nodes reduces the complexity of the model, but also increases the risk of underfitting.\n\nTherefore, the number of hidden nodes is the most important structural assumption in determining the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in a neural network.\n\nThe answer is (A).",

Therefore, it is more efficient to train neural networks on CPUs.\n\nStatement 2: The ResNet-50 model has over 1 billion parameters.\n\nThis statement is true because ResNet-50 is a deep convolutional neural network that uses a combination of residual blocks and identity mappings to reduce the number of parameters required for the model.

This penalty term discourages the weights from taking on large values, which can lead to overfitting.\n\nAs we increase the regularization coefficient, the penalty term will increase, which will have the effect of shrinking the weights towards zero. This will reduce the variance of the model, since the weights will be closer to zero, which means the model will have less flexibility to fit the data. However, the bias of the model will also increase, since the weights will be closer to zero, which means the model will have a harder time predicting the mean of the data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Bias decrease ; Variance increase.",

We can start by considering the product rule:\n\nP(A, B, C) = P(A) * P(B) * P(C)\n\nThis is the most basic expression that satisfies the conditions of the problem. However, we need to find a more complex expression that does not assume any independence or conditional independence between the variables.\n\nOne way to do this is to use the chain rule:\n\nP(A, B, C) = P(A | B, C) * P(B, C)\n\nThis expression assumes that A is conditionally independent of B and C given their joint distribution. We can use the law of total probability to rewrite this expression as:\n\nP(A, B, C) = P(A | B, C) * P(B, C) = P(A | B, C) * P(B | C) * P(C)\n\nThis expression assumes that A is conditionally independent of B given C, and that B is conditionally independent of C given A.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to use the Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(A, B, C) = P(A | B, C) * P(B | C) * P(C)\n\nThis expression assumes that A is conditionally independent of B given C, and that B is conditionally independent of C given A.\n\nFinally, we can use the conditional probability formula:\n\nP(A, B, C) = P(A | B) * P(B | C) * P(C | A)\n\nThis expression assumes that A is conditionally independent of B given C, and that B is conditionally independent of C given A.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

The network consists of three nodes, H, U, and W, and two directed edges, one from H to U and one from U to W. The arrows represent the direction of the causal relationship, with H causing U and U causing W.\n\nWe can represent this network using a directed graph, where each node represents a random variable and each directed edge represents a conditional probability distribution. For example, the edge from H to U represents the conditional probability distribution P(U|H), which gives the probability of U given H.\n\nTo determine the number of independent parameters needed for this network, we need to consider the number of parameters that are needed to specify the conditional probability distributions. In this case, there are three conditional probability distributions: P(U|H), P(W|U), and P(W|H).\n\nTo specify each conditional probability distribution, we need to specify the probability of the outcome given the condition. For example, to specify P(U|H), we need to specify the probability of U=1 given H=1, U=0 given H=0, and so on. This requires two parameters for each outcome, since there are two possible outcomes (U=0 or U=1) for each condition (H=0 or H=1).\n\nTherefore, we need a total of 8 parameters to specify the conditional probability distributions for this network.
