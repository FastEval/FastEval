            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nInternational trade will almost always benefit both countries, so why do countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market?\n\nReasoning:\n\nCountries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market because they want to maintain their economic sovereignty. They want to maintain control over their own economic policies and regulations, and they want to ensure that their domestic firms have a competitive advantage over foreign firms.\n\nBenefits of free trade:\n\nFree trade benefits both countries because it allows them to access each other's markets, which increases their overall economic prosperity. It also allows them to specialize in areas where they have comparative advantage, which can lead to increased productivity and efficiency.\n\nHowever, there are also costs associated with free trade. These costs are typically concentrated in the form of tariffs and other trade barriers, which can make it more expensive for firms to trade with each other. Additionally, the benefits of free trade are often dispersed, which means that some countries may benefit more than others.\n\nCountries also try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market because they may be concerned about the potential for international conflict to disrupt trade. This is particularly true in cases where countries have historically had tense or hostile relationships with each other.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe correct answer is (B) because the costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed. This means that some countries may benefit more than others, which can lead to a situation where some countries may be disadvantaged by free trade. Countries may also be concerned about the potential for international conflict to disrupt trade, which can also lead to the protection of domestic firms.",

The war reduced European population levels below that of the United States:\n   The war caused a significant loss of life in Europe, which led to a decline in population levels. This reduced the amount of labor available in Europe, which in turn reduced the amount of economic activity and production.\n\n2. The United States seized German resources after the war:\n   The United States seized German resources after the war, including raw materials, industrial equipment, and other resources. This gave the United States a significant advantage in the global economy.\n\n3.

This theory states that the behavior of a country in the international system is determined by its relative strength and weakness vis-\u00e0-vis other countries. The external environment of the international system is the set of factors that affect the relative strength and weakness of a country in the international system. These factors include the geopolitical situation, the economic situation, and the political situation of other countries.\n\nTherefore, Rosenau argues that the external environment of the international system is the most important factor to consider in explaining the foreign policy behavior of the United States.",
