            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nThe question is asking us to determine the correct answer based on the given information. We need to analyze the impact of the purchase on the GDP.\n\nFirst, let's define the terms:\n\n- GDP: Gross Domestic Product\n- C: Consumption\n- I: Investment\n- GI: Gross Income\n\nNow, let's analyze the impact of the purchase on the GDP:\n\n1. The purchase of the Matisse painting will increase the value of the board room, which will increase the value of the building.\n2. The purchase of the Matisse painting will increase the value of the company's assets, which will increase the company's GI.\n3. The purchase of the Matisse painting will increase the company's income, which will increase the company's I.\n4. The purchase of the Matisse painting will increase the company's expenses, which will decrease the company's C.\n\nNow, let's analyze the impact of the purchase on the GDP:\n\n1. The purchase of the Matisse painting will increase the company's GI, which will increase the GDP.\n2. The purchase of the Matisse painting will decrease the company's C, which will decrease the GDP.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nIf the government collects more money in net taxes than it spends, it means that there is a surplus in the government's finances. This surplus can be categorized into three types:\n\n1. Current account surplus: This occurs when the government collects more in taxes than it spends on imports and exports combined. This means that the government has more money in its coffers than it needs to pay for its imports and exports.\n\n2. Budget surplus: This occurs when the government collects more in taxes than it spends on all its expenses, including salaries, pensions, and other benefits. This means that the government has more money in its coffers than it needs to pay for its expenses.\n\n3. Trade surplus: This occurs when the government collects more in taxes than it spends on imports, but less than it spends on exports. This means that the government has more money in its coffers than it needs to pay for its imports, but it has less money than it needs to pay for its exports.\n\nIn this case, the answer would be (B) because the government collects more in taxes than it spends on all its expenses, including salaries, pensions, and other benefits. This means that the government has a budget surplus.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The best example of a negative supply shock to the economy would be (D) unexpectedly higher resource prices.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA negative supply shock to the economy occurs when there is a sudden and unexpected increase in the price of a resource that is essential to the production of goods and services. This can cause a decrease in demand for goods and services, leading to a decrease in economic activity and a decrease in economic growth.\n\nIn this case, unexpectedly higher resource prices would be a negative supply shock because it would cause a decrease in demand for goods and services, leading to a decrease in economic activity and a decrease in economic growth.",

This means that the central bank increases the interest rates to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment. This increase in interest rates discourages savers from investing in risky assets and instead encourages them to save their money in risk-free assets such as government bonds. This leads to a decrease in the demand for risky assets, which in turn leads to a decrease in the price of those assets.
