            "question": "An investor and a developer own adjoining lots in the central portion of a city. Each of their lots had an office building on it. The developer decided to raze the existing building on her lot and to erect a building of greater height. The developer has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other than those dealing with various approvals for zoning, building, etc. ). After the developer had torn down the existing building, she proceeded to excavate deeper. The developer used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. The investor notified the developer that cracks were developing in the building situated on the investor's lot. The developer took the view that any subsidence suffered by the investor was due to the weight of the investor's building and correctly asserted that none would have occurred had the investor's land been in its natural state. The developer continued to excavate. The building on the investor's lot did suffer extensive damage, requiring the expenditure of $750,000 to remedy the defects. Which of the following is the best comment concerning the investor's action to recover damages from the developer?\n\n(A) The developer is liable, because she removed necessary support for the investor's lot.\n(B) The developer cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved.\n(C) Once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the right of lateral support.\n(D) The developer's only obligation was to satisf' all local, state, and federal safety regulations.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nThe investor's action to recover damages from the developer is not the best comment, because the developer is not liable for the subsidence of the investor's lot. The developer removed the existing building on her lot, which caused the subsidence of the investor's lot. However, the developer did not remove the necessary support for the investor's lot, as the investor's building was already in place. Therefore, the developer cannot be held liable for the subsidence of the investor's lot.\n\nThe best comment concerning the investor's action to recover damages from the developer is (B) The developer cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved. This is because the developer did not remove the necessary support for the investor's lot, and the investor's building was already in place. Therefore, the developer cannot be held liable for the subsidence of the investor's lot. However, if the developer's negligence is proved, she may be held liable for the damages.",

            "question": "An incumbent was running for re-election as the mayor of a city. During one of his opponent's campaign speeches, he stated that the mayor had once propositioned a prostitute. A television correspondent who was covering the election was present when the opponent made the statement. She recorded the opponent's remark about the mayor in her notebook. In a stunning upset, the opponent defeated the mayor in the election. Many of the pollsters attributed the mayor's loss to the question of his moral character following the opponent's smear campaign depicting the mayor as a client of prostitutes. Following the election, the mayor sued the opponent for defamation, basing his suit on the opponent's statement that the mayor had \"once propositioned a prostitute. \" At trial, the mayor calls the television correspondent to testify concerning her recollection of what the opponent said during the campaign speech attended by the television correspondent. The television correspondent's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the television correspondent recorded the opponent's statement in her business capacity.\n(B) admissible, because the television correspondent had firsthand knowledge of the opponent's statement.\n(C) inadmissible, because the notebook entry is the best evidence.\n(D) inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.",

They stopped their patrol car and walked over to the man, whom they recognized as a troublemaker from the neighboring town. Realizing that the man was extremely intoxicated, they grabbed him and shoved him into their patrol car. They drove the man around in the police car for a few minutes and told him he had two choices. They would either take him to jail for the night or drive him to the city limits and drop him off there. The man indicated that he didn't want to go to jail. One of the officers then said, \"Does that mean you want us to drop you off at the city limits?\" The man replied, \"Yes. \" They then drove him to the city limits and left him along a busy highway. Moments later, the man staggered onto the street and was struck by a car driven by a motorist. He suffered multiple injuries. If the man asserts a claim against the police department based on negligence, he will most likely\n\n(A) recover, because the police should have realized it was dangerous to drop him off where they did.\n(B) recover, because the police knew that the man was intoxicated when they dropped him off.\n(C) not recover, because the man chose to be driven to the city limits.\n(D) not recover, because the motorist's act was a supervening cause of his injury.",
