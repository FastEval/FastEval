            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand what a \"home\" is. In the United States, a \"home\" is typically defined as a single-family dwelling or a duplex or apartment building with two or more units. We can estimate the number of homes in the United States by multiplying the total population by the average number of people per household. The average number of people per household in the United States is 2.5, according to the 2019 Census. Therefore, we can estimate the total number of homes in the United States as follows:\n\nNumber of homes = population * average number of people per household\nNumber of homes = 328,200,000 * 2.5\nNumber of homes = 841,000,000\n\nNext, we need to estimate the number of people who watch movies in each home. We can assume that the average number of people who watch movies in a home is 2.5, which is the same as the average number of people per household. Therefore, we can estimate the total number of people who watch movies in the United States as follows:\n\nNumber of movie watchers = number of homes * average number of people who watch movies in each home\nNumber of movie watchers = 841,000,000 * 2.5\nNumber of movie watchers = 2,083,000,000\n\nFinally, we need to estimate the number of movies watched in each home in one year. We can assume that the average number of movies watched in a home per year is 100. Therefore, we can estimate the total number of movies watched in the United States in one year as follows:\n\nNumber of movies watched = number of movie watchers * average number of movies watched in each home per year\nNumber of movies watched = 2,083,000,000 * 100\nNumber of movies watched = 208,300,000,000\n\nTherefore, the approximate number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year is 208,300,000,000.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nTask A: Counting all the apples in the basket is a good way to teach students to compare quantities because it requires them to count the same quantity (number of apples) in two different ways (red and yellow apples). This task also requires students to compare the two quantities and determine if they are equal or not.\n\nTask B: Placing one apple in the middle of the place mat on their desks is also a good way to teach students to compare quantities because it requires them to compare the same quantity (number of apples) in two different ways (red and yellow apples). This task also requires students to compare the two quantities and determine if they are equal or not.\n\nTask C: Making a Venn diagram for the color of the apples is not a good way to teach students to compare quantities because it does not require them to compare the same quantity (number of apples) in two different ways (red and yellow apples). This task only requires students to identify the color of the apples and does not require them to compare the two quantities.\n\nTask D: Determining whether the numbers of red and yellow apples are equal or not is not a good way to teach students to compare quantities because it does not require them to compare the same quantity (number of apples) in two different ways (red and yellow apples). This task only requires students to count the number of red and yellow apples and does not require them to compare the two quantities.\n\nTherefore, the best targeted task is Task A or Task B.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand how much energy is required to produce ice in the first place. We can estimate this by using the latent heat of fusion, which is the amount of energy required to melt ice into water. The latent heat of fusion for ice is approximately 334 kJ/g, which means that it takes 334 kJ/g of energy to produce 1 gram of ice.\n\nNext, we need to estimate how much ice is thrown away each year in the United States. We can do this by looking at the statistics provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). According to the EPA, Americans throw away an estimated 1.3 billion pounds of ice each year.\n\nUsing these estimates, we can calculate the amount of energy required to produce all of the ice that is thrown away each year. This is simply the product of the number of pounds of ice thrown away and the latent heat of fusion.\n\n1.3 billion pounds of ice x 334 kJ/g = 425 million kJ\n\nTherefore, the amount of energy required to produce all of the ice that is thrown away each year in the United States is approximately 425 million kJ.\n\nTo convert this energy from kilojoules to joules, we multiply by 1000:\n\n425 million kJ x 1000 = 425 billion J\n\nTherefore, the amount of energy that Americans waste each year by throwing out the unused ice in their drinks is approximately 425 billion J.",
