The patron is asking for decaf coffee, and the main character is intentionally disregarding the patron's preference. This is clearly a morally wrong action.\n\nScenario 2: The main character is handing his brother the toilet brush, which is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The main character is simply helping his brother, and there is no intentional disregard for the brother's preference.
