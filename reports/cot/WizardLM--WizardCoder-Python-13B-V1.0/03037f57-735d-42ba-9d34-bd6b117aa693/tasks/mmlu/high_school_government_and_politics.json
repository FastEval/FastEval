            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nAppellate courts are courts that review decisions made by lower courts. They are courts of last resort, where a case can be appealed if the lower court's decision is incorrect or unreasonable.\n\n(A) Appellate judges never use the stare decisis principle.\n\nFalse.

This principle is used to ensure consistency and predictability in the law.\n\n(B) Appellate trials are usually jury trials.\n\nFalse. Appellate trials are usually not jury trials. They are usually heard by a panel of judges, who review the evidence and arguments presented by the parties.\n\n(C) Appellate judges usually decide the facts of a case.\n\nFalse. Appellate judges do not decide the facts of a case.

This is because the Senate Committee on Appropriations is responsible for overseeing the budget and spending of the federal government.

The Federalists believed that the federal government should have more power than the states, while the Anti-Federalists believed that the federal government should have less power than the states. The Federalists argued that the Constitution should be ratified because it would give the federal government the power to enforce laws and collect taxes, which would be necessary for the country to function effectively. The Anti-Federalists argued that the Constitution should not be ratified because it would give the federal government too much power and would lead to tyranny.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Fiscal federalism.\n\nExplanation:\n\nFiscal federalism is a form of federalism in which each level of government has its own budget and is responsible for its own spending. In a project where multiple levels of government work together, the federal government provides most of the funding, which is then distributed to the states and local governments. This allows for a more equitable distribution of resources and ensures that each level of government has the necessary funds to carry out its responsibilities. Therefore, the principle of fiscal federalism is realized in this scenario.",

This is a federal mandate because it requires states to meet certain standards and provides funding to help them meet those standards.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) peer pressure. \n\nExplanation: \n\nPeople who join a political party other than the one to which their parents belong most often do so because of peer pressure. This means that they are influenced by the opinions and actions of their peers, who may have different political views. This can be a result of social pressure, which can be either positive or negative. \n\nPeer pressure can be a powerful force in shaping a person's political views. It can be a positive influence, as it can help people to learn about different political ideas and form their own opinions. However, it can also be a negative influence, as it can lead to people joining political parties based on superficial reasons or to fit in with a group. \n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (A) peer pressure, as it is the most common reason for people to join a political party other than the one to which their parents belong most often.",

This means that House members are more focused on their committee work and are less likely to be distracted by other issues.\n\nSenators, on the other hand, may serve on multiple committees simultaneously. This means that senators may be more distracted by other issues and may not be as focused on their committee work.\n\n(B) Senate committees have relatively little power to alter legislation.\n\nThis is true because the Senate has a more powerful role in the legislative process than the House. However, this does not mean that House members are not concerned about their committee assignments.\n\n(C) bills in the Senate must pass through all committees before reaching the floor.\n\nThis is true because the Senate has a more rigorous process for passing legislation than the House. However, this does not mean that House members are not concerned about their committee assignments.\n\n(D) the rules make it extremely difficult for representatives to influence legislation on the House floor.\n\nThis is true because the House has more rules and procedures in place to ensure that legislation is passed in a fair and equitable manner. However, this does not mean that House members are not concerned about their committee assignments.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).",
