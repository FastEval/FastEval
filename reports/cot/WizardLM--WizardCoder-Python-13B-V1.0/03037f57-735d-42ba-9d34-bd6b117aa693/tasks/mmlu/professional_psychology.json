            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D). \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nThe question is asking about the American Psychological Association (APA). The options are given in terms of research participants. The correct answer is (D) because it refers to people who are afflicted with a chronic disease. This is because chronic diseases are long-term conditions that require ongoing treatment and management. Therefore, people with chronic diseases are likely to be more vulnerable to the effects of research, and may be more likely to be included in research studies. Therefore, the APA should be more inclusive of people with chronic diseases in its research.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C). \n\nExplanation: \n\nThe Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model suggests that people in the integrative awareness stage begin to question their rejection of all aspects of the dominant culture and absolute loyalty to their own culture. This stage is characterized by a growing awareness of the similarities and differences between one's own culture and the dominant culture. This awareness leads to a desire to understand and accept the dominant culture, and to reject the rejection of the dominant culture that is often associated with the rejection of one's own culture.",

This may lead to analgesia, or pain relief.\n\n(B) may produce its effects by promoting the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine\n\nReasoning: This option suggests that electrical stimulation of the brain may release the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which is responsible for the transmission of signals between nerve cells.
