            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to know the molecular mass of propane, which is 44.06 g/mol. We can use this information to find the number of moles of propane in 6.2 g of propane.\n\nFirst, we need to convert 6.2 g to moles. We can do this by dividing the mass by the molecular mass:\n\n6.2 g / 44.06 g/mol = 0.136 mol\n\nNext, we need to convert this number of moles to moles of propane. We can do this by dividing the number of moles by the number of moles of propane in one mole of propane, which is 1. We can also simplify the division by multiplying both sides by 1:\n\n1 mol / 1 mol of propane = 1\n\nTherefore, the number of moles of propane in 6.2 g of propane is:\n\n0.136 mol / 1 mol of propane = 0.136 mol of propane\n\nThe final answer is (D) 7.1 mol.",

            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nA reaction is spontaneous if the standard Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G\u00b0) is negative. This means that the reaction is exergonic, meaning that it requires energy input to occur.\n\nThe standard state of a reaction is defined as the state where all reactants and products are in their standard concentrations and pressures. The equilibrium constant (Keq) is defined as the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium.\n\nIf the value of Keq is less than one, it means that the equilibrium constant is less than one, which means that the reaction is not in equilibrium. This means that the reaction is not spontaneous.\n\nIf the value of \u0394G\u00b0 is greater than zero, it means that the reaction is exergonic, meaning that it requires energy input to occur. This means that the reaction is not spontaneous.\n\nIf the value of \u0394S\u00b0 is greater than zero, it means that the reaction is enthalpic, meaning that it produces heat.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nThe half life of a compound is the time it takes for half of the compound to be converted into its products. In this case, the half life of SO2Cl2 will depend on the rate constant of the reaction. The rate constant is a measure of the rate of the reaction, which is proportional to the rate of the reaction.\n\nIf the reaction is first order overall, then the rate of the reaction is proportional to the concentration of SO2Cl2. Therefore, increasing the initial concentration of SO2Cl2 will increase the rate of the reaction, which will decrease the half life of SO2Cl2.\n\nHowever, the temperature and pressure of the reaction do not affect the rate constant directly.
