When the atria contract, the left ventricle contracts as well, which increases the pressure in the left ventricle and forces the blood to flow through the vessels. \r\n\r\nThe right ventricle is responsible for pumping blood back to the atria. When the right ventricle relaxes, the blood flow through the vessels is interrupted, which means that the blood is not being pumped to the rest of the body. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).",

It is not a cause of ophthalmoplegia, which is a condition in which the nerves that control eye movement are damaged or destroyed.\n\n(B) Graves' disease does not cause a large multi-nodular goitre, which is a condition in which the thyroid gland enlarges and produces multiple nodules.\n\n(C) Graves' disease is more common in males than in females, as it is more commonly associated with male hormonal changes during puberty and adulthood.\n\n(D) Graves' disease did not cause 'Derbyshire Neck' in the past, as this is a condition in which the neck muscles become tight and stiff, leading to a characteristic posture and speech pattern.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C). \n\nExplanation: \n\nFatigue in high intensity exercise is caused by a number of factors, including inadequate training, poor nutrition, and dehydration. However, the most fundamental cause of fatigue is the inability of the body to meet the demand for energy. This is because the body's energy supply is limited by the amount of oxygen that can be delivered to the muscles. \n\nTo meet this demand, the body relies on the conversion of glucose into energy through the process of glycolysis. However, during high intensity exercise, the body's ability to convert glucose into energy is impaired, leading to a decrease in the supply of ATP to the muscles. This results in a decrease in the muscle's ability to contract, leading to fatigue. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C), which states that failure of the ATP supply to match the demand is the fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C). \n\nExplanation: \n\nThe time taken for the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise is determined by the rate of phosphocreatine hydrolysis and re-synthesis. \n\nPhosphocreatine hydrolysis is the process of breaking down phosphocreatine into its constituent components, creatine and phosphate. The rate of phosphocreatine hydrolysis is determined by the concentration of phosphocreatine and the enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis. \n\nThe rate of phosphocreatine re-synthesis is determined by the concentration of creatine and the enzyme that catalyzes the re-synthesis. \n\nThe time taken for the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine is the time taken for the rate of phosphocreatine hydrolysis to equal the rate of phosphocreatine re-synthesis. \n\nThe rate of phosphocreatine hydrolysis is generally faster than the rate of phosphocreatine re-synthesis. Therefore, the time taken for the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine is shorter than the time taken for the rate of phosphocreatine hydrolysis to equal the rate of phosphocreatine re-synthesis. \n\nThe time taken for the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise is typically longer than the time taken for the rate of phosphocreatine hydrolysis to equal the rate of phosphocreatine re-synthesis. Therefore, the time taken for the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise is longer than 10 seconds. \n\nThe time taken for the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise is typically longer than 30 seconds. Therefore, the time taken for the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise is longer than 30 seconds. \n\nThe time taken for the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise is typically longer than 1 minute. Therefore, the time taken for the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise is longer than 1 minute. \n\nThe time taken for the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise is typically longer than 4 minutes. Therefore, the time taken for the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise is longer than 4 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C).",
