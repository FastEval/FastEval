            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to first understand what work is. Work is the amount of energy transferred to an object when a force acts on it. In this case, we are given a constant force F that acts on a particle along the path given by (t, t^2, t^3) between time t=0 and t=1. We need to find the work done by this force on the particle.\n\nTo find the work done by a force, we need to integrate the force along the path. The force is given by F = (-1, 0, 1), which means that the x-component of the force is -1, the y-component is 0, and the z-component is 1. We can represent this force as a vector in xyz-space using the following equation:\n\nF = (-1, 0, 1) = -1i + 0j + 1k\n\nwhere i, j, and k are the unit vectors in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.\n\nTo find the work done by this force, we need to integrate the dot product of the force and the velocity of the particle along the path. The velocity of the particle is given by the derivative of the path with respect to time, which is:\n\nv(t) = (1, 2t, 3t^2)\n\nTo find the dot product of F and v(t), we can use the following equation:\n\nF . v(t) = (-1, 0, 1) . (1, 2t, 3t^2) = -1 + 0 + 3t^2\n\nNow we can integrate this expression from t=0 to t=1 to find the work done by the force:\n\nW = -1 + 0 + 3(1^2 - 0^2) = -1 + 3 = 2\n\nTherefore, the work done by the force F on the particle is 2 joules. The answer is (C) 0.",
