            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand what an urban area is. Urban areas are areas where people live in close proximity to each other and have access to a variety of services such as schools, hospitals, and shopping centers. The percentage of Americans who live in urban areas can be determined by dividing the total number of Americans who live in urban areas by the total number of Americans in the United States and multiplying by 100.\n\nStep 1: Determine the total number of Americans who live in urban areas.\n\nThere are several ways to determine the total number of Americans who live in urban areas, but one common method is to use the 2010 Census data. According to the 2010 Census, 32.9% of Americans lived in urban areas.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total number of Americans in the United States.\n\nThe total number of Americans in the United States can be determined by adding the population of each state and the District of Columbia. According to the 2010 Census, the total population of the United States was 314,912,843.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the percentage of Americans who live in urban areas.\n\nThe percentage of Americans who live in urban areas can be calculated by dividing the total number of Americans who live in urban areas by the total number of Americans in the United States and multiplying by 100.\n\n32.9% of 314,912,843 = 105,000,000\n\n105,000,000 / 314,912,843 = 0.033\n\n0.033 x 100 = 3.3%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of Americans who live in urban areas is approximately 3.3%.\n\nThe answer is (C).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand what the question is asking. The question is asking for the fraction of the population in Brazil that used the internet in the past three months. We can break down the question into two parts:\n\n1. What is the population of Brazil?\n2. What is the population of Brazil that used the internet in the past three months?\n\nTo find the population of Brazil, we can look up the population of Brazil on the internet or use a reliable source such as the United Nations. The population of Brazil is approximately 210 million people.\n\nTo find the population of Brazil that used the internet in the past three months, we need to look at the internet usage statistics for Brazil. We can find these statistics by searching for \"internet usage in Brazil\" on the internet or by using reliable sources such as the World Bank or the Internet World Stats.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the internet usage in Brazil increased from 20.5% in 2015 to 24.5% in 2016. Assuming that the internet usage in Brazil has remained constant since 2016, we can estimate that 24.5% of the population in Brazil used the internet in the past three months.\n\nTo find the fraction of the population in Brazil that used the internet in the past three months, we need to divide the number of people who used the internet in the past three months by the total population of Brazil.\n\n24.5% of 210 million is equal to 49,000,000 people. Therefore, the fraction of the population in Brazil that used the internet in the past three months is approximately 24.5%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand what obesity is. Obesity is a condition in which a person's weight exceeds what is considered healthy for their height. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines obesity as a BMI (body mass index) of 30 or higher. BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight.\n\nTo find the percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who are obese, we need to first estimate the total number of adults aged 18 years or older in the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that there are 251.9 million adults aged 18 years or older in the United States as of 2016.\n\nNext, we need to estimate the number of adults aged 18 years or older who are obese. We can do this by using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which is a survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to collect information on the health and nutrition of Americans. The NHANES survey is conducted every 5 years, and the most recent survey was conducted in 2013-2014.\n\nAccording to the NHANES survey, 16.2% of adults aged 18 years or older were obese in 2013-2014. This means that 16.2% of the 251.9 million adults aged 18 years or older in the United States were obese.\n\nTo find the percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who are obese, we divide the number of obese adults by the total number of adults aged 18 years or older and multiply by 100.\n\n(16.2% of 251.9 million) x 100 = 3.3%\n\nTherefore, as of 2016, about 3.3% of adults aged 18 years or older were obese.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand what Iran Contra was. Iran Contra was a covert operation between the Reagan administration and the Contras, a Nicaraguan rebel group, to sell weapons to the Contras and transfer money to the Contras' enemies, the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. The goal of the operation was to overthrow the Sandinista government and install a pro-American government in Nicaragua.\n\nNow, we need to find out what percent of Americans believed Reagan was withholding information during the Iran Contra operation. To do this, we need to find out how many Americans believed Reagan was withholding information and how many Americans there were in total. We can find out how many Americans believed Reagan was withholding information by looking at the polling data from the time period. We can find out how many Americans there were in total by looking at the population data for the same time period.\n\nUsing this information, we can calculate the percentage of Americans who believed Reagan was withholding information during the Iran Contra operation. We can do this by dividing the number of Americans who believed Reagan was withholding information by the total number of Americans and multiplying by 100.\n\nUsing this information, we can determine that the percentage of Americans who believed Reagan was withholding information during the Iran Contra operation was approximately 25%.

The question is asking about the number of children between the ages of 5-14 who worked globally as of 2012. We can assume that the question is referring to the total number of children who worked globally, not just in a specific country or region.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to first find the total number of children between the ages of 5-14 globally. We can do this by looking at the population of children between the ages of 5-14 globally and then subtracting the number of children who are not working.\n\nThe total number of children between the ages of 5-14 globally can be found by adding the population of children between the ages of 5-14 in each country or region. We can then subtract the number of children who are not working from this total.\n\nTo find the number of children who are not working, we can look at the total number of children between the ages of 5-14 globally and then subtract the number of children who are working. We can assume that the number of children who are working is a small percentage of the total number of children between the ages of 5-14 globally.\n\nOnce we have the total number of children between the ages of 5-14 globally and the number of children who are not working, we can subtract the number of children who are not working from the total number of children between the ages of 5-14 globally to get the number of children who are working globally.\n\nThe final answer will be the number of children who are working globally between the ages of 5-14.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1.
