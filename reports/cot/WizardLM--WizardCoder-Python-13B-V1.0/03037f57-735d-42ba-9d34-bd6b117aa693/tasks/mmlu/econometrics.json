The t-distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is used to calculate the confidence interval for the intercept term of a linear regression model. The t-distribution is derived from the normal distribution and is used when the sample size is small.\n\nThe formula for the t-distribution is:\n\nt = (mean - intercept) / (standard error of the intercept)\n\nwhere mean is the mean of the response variable, intercept is the intercept term of the model, and standard error of the intercept is the standard error of the intercept term.\n\nTo find the standard error of the intercept term, we use the following formula:\n\nstandard error of the intercept = sqrt(variance of the residuals / (n-2))\n\nwhere n is the sample size, and variance of the residuals is the variance of the residuals of the model.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the t-distribution for the intercept term of the model. We can then use the t-distribution to find the confidence interval for the intercept term.\n\nThe t-distribution has two tails, so we can use the two-sided confidence interval. The two-sided confidence interval is calculated as:\n\nconfidence interval = (mean - t(alpha/2) * standard error of the intercept, mean + t(alpha/2) * standard error of the intercept)\n\nwhere alpha is the significance level (0.05 for a 95% confidence interval), and t(alpha/2) is the critical value of the t-distribution at the significance level.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the confidence interval for the intercept term of the model.
