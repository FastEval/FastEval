            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nIndividualism is a philosophical concept that emphasizes the importance of the individual and their rights over the collective good. It is often associated with the idea of self-interest and the pursuit of one's own happiness.\n\nAccording to Hourdequin, individualism leads us into two problems:\n\n1. Failures of developing integration and integrality:\n\nIndividualism can lead to a fragmented and atomistic view of the world, which can hinder the development of integration and integrality. Integration and integrality are concepts that refer to the interconnectedness of different parts of a system, and the ability of those parts to work together harmoniously.\n\n2. Tragedy of the commons and atomistic view of persons:\n\nIndividualism can lead to a \"tragedy of the commons\" situation, where each individual treats the resources of the commons as their own private property, leading to overconsumption and depletion of the commons. This can also lead to an atomistic view of persons, where each person is seen as a separate entity, and their actions do not affect the well-being of others.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe answer is (A) and (B).",

If someone is interfering with another person's right to life, or if someone is depriving another person of a good or service, then it may be morally permissible to kill or let that person die. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C), which indicates that both rights are important in determining the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction.",
