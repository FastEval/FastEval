            "question": "A teacher's union and a school district are negotiating salaries for the coming year. The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible. The district, like most, has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators. The salaries of all teachers and administrators are included in trying to figure out, on average, how much the professional staff currently earn. Which of the following would the teachers' union be most likely to quote during negotiations?\n\n(A) The mean of all the salaries.\n(B) The mode of all the salaries.\n(C) The standard deviation of all the salaries.\n(D) The median of all the salaries.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nThe teachers' union is most likely to quote the mean of all the salaries during negotiations because it is the simplest and most straightforward measure of central tendency. The mean is the average of all the salaries, which gives an idea of the average salary of the professional staff. The mean is also the most commonly used measure of central tendency, and it is easy to calculate.\n\nThe mode is the most common value in a set of data, and it is not applicable to salaries because there may be multiple modes. For example, if there are three teachers who earn $50,000, three teachers who earn $60,000, and one teacher who earns $70,000, the mode is not clear.\n\nThe standard deviation is a measure of dispersion, and it is not applicable to salaries because it measures the variability of the data. It is not useful for comparing the salaries of different professionals.\n\nThe median is the middle value in a set of data, and it is not applicable to salaries because it is not a measure of central tendency. It is a measure of location, and it does not tell us anything about the average salary of the professional staff.\n\nTherefore, the teachers' union is most likely to quote the mean of all the salaries during negotiations.",

Select four men and five women from the pool of potential jurors.\n\nFor each of these ways, we need to calculate the probability of selecting at least three women in the remaining nine jurors.\n\nFor the first way, there are C(9,6) ways to select six women from the pool of potential jurors, and C(3,3) ways to select three men from the pool of potential jurors. Therefore, the probability of selecting at least three women in the remaining nine jurors is:\n\nP(at least three women in remaining nine jurors | first three are men) = 1 - P(no women in remaining nine jurors | first three are men)\n                                 = 1 - (C(9,6) * C(6,0)) / C(12,9)\n                                 = 1 - (9 choose 6) * (6 choose 0) / (12 choose 9)\n\nFor the second way, there are C(9,5) ways to select five women from the pool of potential jurors, and C(4,4) ways to select four men from the pool of potential jurors. Therefore, the probability of selecting at least three women in the remaining nine jurors is:\n\nP(at least three women in remaining nine jurors | first three are men) = 1 - P(no women in remaining nine jurors | first three are men)\n                                 = 1 - (C(9,5) * C(5,0)) / C(12,9)\n                                 = 1 - (9 choose 5) * (5 choose 0) / (12 choose 9)\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a jury of 12 that meets the requirements of this trial, given that the first three jurors are men, is:\n\nP(jury of 12 meets requirements | first three are men) = P(at least three women in remaining nine jurors | first three are men)\n                                    = 1 - (9 choose 6) * (6 choose 0) / (12 choose 9) + (9 choose 5) * (5 choose 0) / (12 choose 9)\n\nNow, we can combine these two probabilities to get the probability of selecting a jury of 12 that meets the requirements of this trial, given that the first three jurors are either men or women:\n\nP(jury of 12 meets requirements) = P(jury of 12 meets requirements | first three are women) + P(jury of 12 meets requirements | first three are men)\n                                  = P(jury of 12 meets requirements | first three are women) + P(jury of 12 meets requirements | first three are men)\n                                  = 1 - (9 choose 6) * (6 choose 0) / (12 choose 9) + (9 choose 5) * (5 choose 0) / (12 choose 9) + 1 - (9 choose 6) * (6 choose 0) / (12 choose 9) + (9 choose 5) * (5 choose 0) / (12 choose 9)\n                                  = 2 * (1 - (9 choose 6) * (6 choose 0) / (12 choose 9) + (9 choose 5) * (5 choose 0) / (12 choose 9))\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a jury of 12 that meets the requirements of this trial is:\n\nP(jury of 12 meets requirements) = 2 * (1 - (9 choose 6) * (6 choose 0) / (12 choose 9) + (9 choose 5) * (5 choose 0) / (12 choose 9))\n                             = 2 * (1 - (9 choose 6) * (6 choose 0) / (12 choose 9) + (9 choose 5) * (5 choose 0) / (12 choose 9))\n\nFinally, we can simplify this expression to get the answer:\n\nP(jury of 12 meets requirements) = 2 * (1 - (9 choose 6) * (6 choose 0) / (12 choose 9) + (9 choose 5) * (5 choose 0) / (12 choose 9))\n                             = 2 * (1 - (9 choose 6) * (6 choose 0) / (12 choose 9) + (9 choose 5) * (5 choose 0) / (12 choose 9))\n                             = 2 * (1 - (9 choose 6) * (6 choose 0) / (12 choose 9) + (9 choose 5) * (5 choose 0) / (12 choose 9))\n                             = 2 * (1 - (9 choose 6) * (6 choose 0) / (12 choose 9) + (9 choose 5) * (5 choose 0) / (12 choose 9))\n                             = 2 * (1 - (9 choose 6) * (6 choose 0) / (12 choose 9) + (9 choose 5) * (5 choose 0) / (12 choose 9))\n                             = 2 * (1 - (9 choose 6) * (6 choose 0) / (12 choose 9) + (9 choose 5) * (5 choose 0) / (12 choose 9))\n                             = 2 * (1 - (9 choose 6) * (6 choose 0",
