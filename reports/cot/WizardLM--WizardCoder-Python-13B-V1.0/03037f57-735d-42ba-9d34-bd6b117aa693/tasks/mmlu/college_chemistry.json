            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\n(A) Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\n\nReasoning:\n\nSquare planar complexes are characterized by four ligands arranged in a square planar geometry. In order for optical isomerism to occur, the ligands must be able to rotate around the central metal atom. However, in a square planar geometry, the ligands are fixed in their positions and cannot rotate around the central metal atom. Therefore, square planar complexes cannot display optical isomerism.\n\n(B) Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\n\nReasoning:\n\nTetrahedral complexes are characterized by four ligands arranged in a tetrahedral geometry. In order for optical isomerism to occur, the ligands must be able to rotate around the central metal atom. However, in a tetrahedral geometry, the ligands are fixed in their positions and cannot rotate around the central metal atom. Therefore, tetrahedral complexes cannot display optical isomerism.\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\nReasoning:\n\nLinear complexes are characterized by two ligands arranged in a linear geometry. In order for optical isomerism to occur, the ligands must be able to rotate around the central metal atom. However, in a linear geometry, the ligands are fixed in their positions and cannot rotate around the central metal atom. Therefore, linear complexes can display optical isomerism only when both ligands are different.\n\n(D) Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\n\nReasoning:\n\nOctahedral complexes are characterized by six ligands arranged in an octahedral geometry. In order for optical isomerism to occur, the ligands must be able to rotate around the central metal atom. However, in an octahedral geometry, the ligands are fixed in their positions and cannot rotate around the central metal atom. Therefore, octahedral complexes can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is (C).",
