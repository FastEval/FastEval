            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "NGS is most often used to identify genetic variations in a sample. These variations can be caused by mutations, rearrangements, or deletions in the genome. NGS is commonly used in the following ways:\n\n1. To identify new viruses: NGS can be used to identify new viruses that have not been previously identified. This is done by sequencing the genome of the sample and comparing it to known viral genomes. If the sample matches a known virus, the sample is considered infected. If the sample does not match a known virus, it is considered a new virus.\n\n2. To search for drug resistant mutants: NGS can be used to identify mutations in a sample that make it resistant to a particular drug. This is done by sequencing the genome of the sample and comparing it to the genome of a known drug resistant mutant. If the sample matches the mutant, it is considered resistant to the drug.\n\n3. To identify quasi species viruses: NGS can be used to identify viruses that are closely related to known species but have not yet been classified as a separate species. This is done by sequencing the genome of the sample and comparing it to the genomes of known species. If the sample matches a known species, it is considered a member of that species. If the sample does not match a known species, it is considered a quasi species virus.\n\n4. To identify genetic variations in a sample: NGS can be used to identify genetic variations in a sample, such as mutations, rearrangements, or deletions, that cause the sample to behave differently from other samples of the same species. This is done by sequencing the genome of the sample and comparing it to the genome of a known sample of the same species. If the sample matches the known sample, it is considered to have the same genetic variations. If the sample does not match the known sample, it is considered to have different genetic variations.\n\nThe answer is (D) Cannot be used. NGS cannot be used for any of the purposes mentioned above, as it is a general technique for identifying genetic variations in a sample.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Effect modification (interaction).\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nRandomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for effect modification (interaction). This means that the treatment being tested has no effect on the outcome, or that the treatment has the same effect on the outcome regardless of the subject's treatment assignment. Randomization ensures that each subject receives the same treatment, and that the treatment is assigned randomly to each subject, which helps to eliminate any potential bias that may be introduced by the order in which subjects are assigned to treatment.\r\n\r\nIn other words, randomization is most helpful for controlling for effect modification because it ensures that the treatment being tested has no effect on the outcome, and that the treatment has the same effect on the outcome regardless of the subject's treatment assignment.",

This type of study design is commonly used in epidemiological research to assess the long-term effects of a toxin or other exposure.",

The term \"coronavirus\" refers to a group of viruses that cause respiratory infections in humans and animals. \n\nThe term \"emergent\" refers to a virus that has recently become a public health concern.

            "model_answer": "The exception is (A) Spread by faecal oral route. \n\nReasoning: \n\nThe other three special characteristics of MERS are: \n\n1. Aerosol droplet transmission: This means that the virus is transmitted through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, causing droplets to form. \n\n2. Reservoir in bats: This means that the virus can survive in the bats' nasal and respiratory tracts, where it can be transmitted to humans. \n\n3. A conduit to humans via camels: This means that the virus can be transmitted from camels to humans through direct contact with the camel's faeces or urine. \n\nHowever, the exception is that MERS is spread by faecal oral route, which means that the virus is transmitted when an infected person eats or drinks something contaminated with the virus. This is different from the other three characteristics, which are all related to aerosol transmission.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nThe scenario described is an example of confounding.\n\nConfounding occurs when two or more factors are associated with an outcome, and one of the factors masks the true association between the other factors and the outcome. In this case, the researchers are trying to assess the association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer, but they are also taking into account whether the subjects are smokers or non-smokers. The fact that the subjects are either smokers or non-smokers could mask the true association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer, as smoking and alcohol consumption may interact in a way that confounds the relationship between the two. Therefore, the researchers need to account for the effect of smoking on the association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer.\n\nThe answer is (B) confounding.",
