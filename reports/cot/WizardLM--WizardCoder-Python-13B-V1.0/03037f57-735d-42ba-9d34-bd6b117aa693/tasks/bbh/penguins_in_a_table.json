We can start by looking at the penguins that are younger than Gwen:\n\n- Louis is younger than Gwen, but is not taller than Gwen.\n- Bernard is younger than Gwen, but is not taller than Gwen.\n- Vincent is older than Gwen, so he cannot be the answer.\n- Gwen is the same age as Gwen, so she cannot be the answer.\n\nTherefore, the only penguin that is younger but taller than Gwen is Bernard.
