The hawk is the second from the left.\n\nTo find the answer, we need to arrange the three birds in a fixed order. We can start by placing the hawk on the left. Then, we can place the cardinal to the right of the hawk. Finally, we can place the falcon to the right of the cardinal.\n\nNow, we can use the given information to determine the position of each bird.\n\n1. The hawk is to the left of the cardinal. This means that the hawk is on the left side of the cardinal.\n2. The hawk is the second from the left. This means that the cardinal is on the left side of the hawk.\n\nNow, we can place the three birds in a fixed order:\n\nHawk - Cardinal - Falcon\n\nThe hawk is the second from the left, so it is the second bird from the left. Therefore, the hawk is the rightmost bird.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",
