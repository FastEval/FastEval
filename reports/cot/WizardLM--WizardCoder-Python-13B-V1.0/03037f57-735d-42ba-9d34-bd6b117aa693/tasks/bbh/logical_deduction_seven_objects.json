For example, we need to know whether Joe finished before or after Mya.\n\nHowever, we can make some inferences based on the given information.\n\n1. Rob finished first, so he must have finished before all the other golfers.\n2. Eve finished last, so she must have finished after all the other golfers.\n3. Dan finished above Ada, so Dan must have finished before Ada.\n4. Mel finished above Mya, so Mel must have finished before Mya.\n5. Joe finished second-to-last, so he must have finished before the last two golfers.\n6. Mya finished third, so she must have finished before the last three golfers.\n\nFrom these inferences, we can eliminate some options:\n\n- Option (A) is not possible because Joe finished second-to-last, which means he finished before the last two golfers.\n- Option (B) is not possible because Mel finished above Mya, which means Mel finished before Mya.\n- Option (C) is not possible because Mya finished third, which means she finished before the last three golfers.\n- Option (D) is not possible because Eve finished last, which means she finished after all the other golfers.\n- Option (E) is not possible because Rob finished first, which means he finished before all the other golfers.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining option is (F), which is Ada.",
