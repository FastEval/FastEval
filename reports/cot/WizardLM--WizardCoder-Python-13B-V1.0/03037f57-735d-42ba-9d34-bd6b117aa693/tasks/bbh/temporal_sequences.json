We can start by looking at the first two activities: David woke up at 5am and Jennifer saw him taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 7am to 9am. Since David woke up earlier than Jennifer saw him taking photos, we know that David could have gone to the gas station between 5am and 7am.\n\nNext, we can look at the third activity: Kimberly saw David buying a bike at the bike shop from 9am to 3pm. Since David could have gone to the gas station between 5am and 7am, we know that he could have gone to the gas station between 9am and 3pm as well.\n\nFinally, we can look at the fourth activity: Linda saw David walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 3pm to 9pm.
