We know that initially Alice was playing cheerleader, Bob was playing right winger, and Claire was playing benchwarmer. After the swaps, we have:\n\n1. Alice playing benchwarmer (after the first swap with Claire)\n2. Claire playing cheerleader (after the first swap with Alice)\n3. Bob playing cheerleader (after the second swap with Claire)\n4. Claire playing right winger (after the second swap with Bob)\n5. Alice playing right winger (after the third swap with Bob)\n\nStep 3: Based on the swaps, we can see that the final position of each player is as follows:\n\nAlice: right winger\nBob: benchwarmer\nClaire: cheerleader\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the answer is (B) right winger.<|im_end|>",
