Alice keeps The Great Gatsby: This is possible if Alice doesn't participate in any more book swaps. Since she initially had The Great Gatsby, it is equally likely that she keeps it or swaps it. Therefore, the probability of Alice keeping The Great Gatsby is 1/2.\n2. Alice gets Frankenstein: This is possible if Alice swaps The Great Gatsby with Bob and then swaps it back with Claire. The probability of this happening is (1/2) \\* (1/2) \\* (1/3), since there are three possible books that Alice could swap with Bob (The Great Gatsby, Ulysses, or Frankenstein), and Bob and Claire both have only two books to swap.\n3. Alice gets Ulysses: This is possible if Alice swaps The Great Gatsby with Claire and then swaps it back with Bob. The probability of this happening is (1/2) \\* (1/2) \\* (1/3), for the same reason as in the previous case.\n\nTherefore, the probability of Alice having each of the three possible books at the end of the semester is 1/2.
