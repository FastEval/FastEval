            "model_answer": "The sarcastic statement is (B) \"He's a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need\". This statement is sarcastic because it uses strong negative language to describe someone who is actually doing a good deed. The use of the word \"terrible\" suggests that the person is doing something wrong or bad, when in reality they are doing something good and generous. The word \"promote\" also has a negative connotation, as if the person is only doing it for personal gain, rather than to help others. Overall, the statement is sarcastic because it uses irony and stark contrast to express the opposite of what is actually true.",

By suggesting that the person should just be happy, it implies that happiness is something that can be controlled and achieved easily. However, the person is already depressed, which suggests that they are not happy. Thus, the statement is implying that the person is responsible for their own depression and should just fix it by being happy. This is sarcastic because it appears to be helpful but actually is mocking the person's situation.\n\nStep 3: Statement B, on the other hand, uses the phrase \"hey just\" to create a casual tone, but the rest of the sentence is actually offering a genuine solution. By stating that the person won't be depressed anymore, it implies that there is a way to overcome depression. This is not sarcastic, as it does not mock the person's situation but rather offers encouragement.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the sarcastic statement is (A) \"Hey just be happy then you won't be depressed anymore.\"",

In option B, \"memeing about being racist\" is also presented as if it is a light-hearted, innocuous activity. However, the phrase \"that's what keeps it toxic\" is sarcastic, because the speaker is intentionally using an oxymoron to convey the opposite of what they actually mean. In this case, the speaker is saying that memeing about being racist is actually toxic, despite the use of \"just\" to make it seem like it is not a serious issue.\n4.

            "model_answer": "The statement that is sarcastic is (B) \"You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the trolls, that woefully endangered species\".\n\nThis is sarcastic because the speaker is using a polite phrase \"You're welcome\" but the actual meaning is the opposite. By saying \"Always glad to feed the trolls\" which is a derogatory term for people who purposefully say things to provoke arguments or to upset others, the speaker is implying that the action of feeding trolls is not a good thing and they are not grateful for it. The phrase \"that woefully endangered species\" is also used ironically to make the sarcasm more explicit. So the speaker is not really thankful but is saying it to be polite while conveying a different meaning.\n\nIn contrast, option (A) is not sarcastic. While feeding elephants is also a good deed, it is not used in a derogatory way and does not have a sarcastic tone.",

While the amount of the scholarship may seem small to some people, it is still a significant achievement for the individual who received it, and the speaker is implying that it is not a significant accomplishment at all. The use of the phrase \"years of work\" also suggests that the speaker expects a much larger reward for the effort put in.",

In both statements, the speaker is mentioning the cost of fuel per mile for a van, and suggesting that it is reasonable.\n\nStep 2: However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the actual cost being mentioned in each statement is quite different. Option A mentions a cost of $0.15 per mile, while Option B mentions a cost of $10 per mile.\n\nStep 3: Given this significant difference in cost, it is reasonable to assume that Option B is being sarcastic, as it is clearly exaggerating the cost of fuel as being \"reasonable\". Option A, on the other hand, is presenting the cost as being reasonable without any hint of sarcasm.\n\nAnswer: B\n(B) That's only about $10 per mile for a van, perfectly reasonable fuel costs",
