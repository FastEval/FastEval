Sarcasm is a form of speech that is intended to mock or convey contempt, and in this statement the speaker is using sarcasm to express the opposite of their true opinion. In reality, the person is likely being generous and trying to help children in need, but the sarcastic statement suggests that they are actually a terrible person. The use of the word \"terrible\" implies that the speaker thinks the person is bad or evil, when in reality they are doing a good deed.",

However, choice (A) is not sarcastic. It may be patronizing or insensitive, but it is not sarcastic.\n4.

The word \"just\" suggests that there is nothing justifiable about using racism in memes, and the word \"toxic\" emphasizes the negative consequences of doing so.

However, we know that being rude can be caused by various factors such as stress, frustration, and disagreement with someone's opinion or action. Additionally, being rude is not always within one's control to prevent.\n\nStep 2: Based on the reasoning above, the sarcastic statement is (A) \"Have you tried not being poor? It is much easier\".
