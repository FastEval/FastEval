In this case, the speaker is using the words \"just be happy\" to convey the opposite meaning. The use of the word \"just\" suggests that being happy is something that can be easily accomplished, which is not true for everyone. The phrase \"you won't be depressed anymore\" implies that the person being addressed is currently depressed, which may not be the case.

Sarcasm is a type of figurative language that uses words to convey a meaning that is opposite or contrary to its literal meaning.\n2. In Option B, the phrase \"Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it toxic\" appears to be stating that making jokes or memes about racism is acceptable and even encouraging it, when in reality, it is meant to convey the opposite meaning.\n3. The use of the word \"just\" implies that making racist memes is insignificant or trivial, whereas the word \"toxic\" suggests that it is harmful and dangerous.\n4. Therefore, Option B is sarcastic because it uses language in a way that is contrary to its literal meaning to convey a message that making racist memes is not acceptable or appropriate.\n\nSo, the answer is (B).<|im_end|>",

In both options, the speaker is using words to suggest one meaning while conveying another, hidden meaning.\n\nStep 2: Option A suggests that urging is different from threatening, but the sarcasm is in the use of the word \"only.\" In reality, urging can be a form of subtle threatening, and the use of the word \"only\" suggests that the speaker believes that the person being addressed is too naive to recognize the underlying threat.\n\nStep 3: Option B suggests that pleading is different from threatening, but the sarcasm is in the use of the word \"only.\" In reality, pleading can be a form of subtle threatening, and the use of the word \"only\" suggests that the speaker believes that the person being addressed is too naive to recognize the underlying threat.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, neither option A nor option B is a sincere statement.\n\nAnswer: Neither (A) nor (B) is a sincere statement.<|im_end|>",

However, the use of the word \"every day\" implies that the behavior is happening frequently, which may not necessarily be a positive thing.\n\nStep 3: On the other hand, option (B) is more explicitly positive, using the word \"great\" to describe the transformation and the use of the word \"every day\" to indicate that the behavior is happening frequently.
