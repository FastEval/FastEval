Here's how we can approach it:\n\nStep 1: Eliminate incorrect options\nWe can start by eliminating any options that are clearly not possible based on the information given. For example, we know that the burgundy item is a pair of sunglasses, so it's not reasonable to think that the item to its left could be a pen or a stress ball. We can also eliminate any options that are the same color as other items in the row, since there's no reason to assume they would be placed next to something of the same color.\n\nStep 2: Use process of elimination\nBased on the information we have, we can start eliminating options until we're left with the correct answer. For example, we know that the item to the left of the burgundy sunglasses cannot be a green pen or a purple stress ball, so we can eliminate options (D) and (Q). We also know that the item can't be a plate or a jug, so we can eliminate options (M) and (N).\n\nStep 3: Check for adjacent colors\nNext, we can look for colors that are adjacent to burgundy in the color wheel. The color directly to the left of burgundy is pink, which is option (R). Therefore, the answer is (R).\n\nAnswer: R",
