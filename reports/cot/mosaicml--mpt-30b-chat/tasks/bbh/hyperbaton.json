Opinion, nationality, and religion\n4. Quantity and quality\n\nNow, let's analyze the two options:\n\nOption A: midsize old grey Brazilian sweater\n\n* Size, shape, and color: midsize (adjective of size), old (adjective of age), grey (adjective of color)\n* Age, material, and purpose: Brazilian (adjective of nationality), sweater (noun)\n\nOption B: midsize grey Brazilian old sweater\n\n* Size, shape, and color: midsize (adjective of size), grey (adjective of color)\n* Age, material, and purpose: Brazilian (adjective of nationality), old (adjective of age), sweater (noun)\n\nThe correct adjective order in this case should follow the general rules mentioned above.

            "model_answer": "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to follow the rules of adjective order which are:\n\n1. Order of specificness: Adjectives that refer to more specific characteristics come before adjectives that refer to general characteristics.\n2. Order of demographics: Adjectives that refer to demographics come before adjectives that refer to physical characteristics.\n3. Order of size: Adjectives that refer to size come before adjectives that refer to shape or color.\n\nLet's analyze the two options:\n\n(A) new leather big triangular American chair\n\nIn this option, we have three adjectives that describe the chair: new, leather, and big. The adjective \"new\" is more specific than \"leather\" and \"big\", so it should come first. \"Leather\" and \"big\" are both general characteristics, so \"leather\" should come before \"big\". Therefore, the correct order is: new leather big triangular American chair.\n\n(B) big new triangular American leather chair\n\nIn this option, we have two adjectives that describe the chair: big and new, and two adjectives that describe the material: triangular and American. The adjective \"big\" refers to size, so it should come first. \"New\" also refers to a specific characteristic, so it should come before \"triangular\" and \"American\". \"Triangular\" and \"American\" both refer to demographics, so \"triangular\" should come before \"American\". Therefore, the correct order is: big new triangular American leather chair.\n\nTherefore, the correct sentence is: (B) big new triangular American leather chair.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the correct adjective order, we should follow the hierarchical order of adjectives. Adjectives that describe the same noun should be ordered based on their degree of comparison, color, size, age, shape, material, and opinion.\n\nIn sentence (A), the adjectives are: rectangular, silver, ancient, green, and big.\n\nRectangular and silver are both size adjectives, and silver comes before rectangular because it is a more specific adjective.\n\nAncient and big are both size adjectives, and ancient comes before big because it is a more specific adjective.\n\nSilver and ancient do not have any hierarchical relationship, so they should be placed next to each other.\n\nGreen and ridiculous are both opinion adjectives, and green comes before ridiculous because it is a more positive adjective.\n\nSo, the correct adjective order for sentence (A) is: silver (ancient), rectangular, green, big.\n\nNow let's analyze sentence (B). The adjectives are: ridiculous, big, ancient, rectangular, and green.\n\nRidiculous and big are both size adjectives, and ridiculous comes before big because it is a more specific adjective.\n\nAncient and rectangular are both shape adjectives, and ancient comes before rectangular because it is a more specific adjective.\n\nGreen and ridiculous do not have any hierarchical relationship, so they should be placed next to each other.\n\nSo, the correct adjective order for sentence (B) is: ridiculous (green), big, ancient, rectangular.\n\nThe correct answer is (B).",
