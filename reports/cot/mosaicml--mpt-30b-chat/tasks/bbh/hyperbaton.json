In this case, we have three adjectives: \"midsize,\" \"old,\" and \"grey.\"\n\nStep 2: \"Midsize\" is a general term that describes the size of the sweater. It is not as specific as the other two adjectives, so it should come first.\n\nStep 3: \"Old\" is a more specific adjective that describes the age of the sweater. It should come second since it provides more information about the sweater.\n\nStep 4: \"Grey\" is the most specific adjective and describes the color of the sweater.
