The table contains information about four penguins: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen. Each penguin has a name, age, height, and weight.\n\nStep 2: Identify the youngest penguin before deletion\nBefore deleting Bernard, we need to identify the youngest penguin based on their age. The youngest penguin in the table is Louis, with an age of 7.\n\nStep 3: Delete the penguin named Bernard\nSince Bernard's name is mentioned in the question, we know we need to remove him from the table. After deleting Bernard, the table will only have three penguins: Louis, Vincent, and Gwen.\n\nStep 4: Identify the youngest penguin after deletion\nNow we need to identify the youngest penguin among Louis, Vincent, and Gwen. The age of Louis is still 7, and the age of Vincent is 9. The age of Gwen is 8, which is the youngest age among the three remaining penguins.\n\nStep 5: Output the answer\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Gwen.<|im_end|>",
