In this case, the falcon is to the right of the blue jay, and the blue jay is to the right of the quail.\n\nStep 3:\nBased on the relationships mentioned, we can infer that the falcon is to the right of the blue jay and the blue jay is to the right of the quail. Therefore, the order cannot be the same as stated in the options (A) and (B).\n\nStep 4:\nSince the falcon is to the right of the blue jay, it must be either the second or the third object from the right. Also, since the blue jay is to the right of the quail, it must be either the second or the third object from the right as well.\n\nStep 5:\nFrom the given statements, we can't determine the exact position of the quail. Hence, we can eliminate option (B) as it specifies the position of the quail.\n\nStep 6:\nNow, we are left with option (A) and (C) which specify the position of the blue jay and the falcon respectively. Based on the relationships mentioned in the paragraph, the falcon must be the second from the left.
