We can assume that it is the 16th of the current month, which means that the current year is the same as the year of Jane's 5th visit.\n\nStep 2: Determine the year of Jane's 5th visit\nSince Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month, we can assume that her 5th visit occurred on the 16th of some month in 2009 or 2010. Since it is mentioned that Jane started visiting the bookstore in October of 2009, we can conclude that her 5th visit also occurred in 2009. Therefore, the year of Jane's 5th visit is 2009.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of months between the current date and the date of Jane's 5th visit\nSince Jane's 5th visit occurred in 2009, we can assume that the current month is different from the month of Jane's 5th visit. Therefore, we need to find out how many months have passed between the current month and the month of Jane's 5th visit. Since Jane started visiting the bookstore in October of 2009, her 5th visit must have occurred in either August, September, or October of 2009. However, since it is mentioned that today is Jane's 5th visit, we can conclude that today's date is the 16th of some month, which means that today's date cannot be in August or September. Therefore, Jane's 5th visit must have occurred in October of 2009, and today's date is in a different month. This means that there are 10 months between the current month and the month of Jane's 5th visit, since there are 11 months between October and the current month.\n\nStep 4: Determine the month one year ago from the month of Jane's 5th visit\nSince there are 10 months between the current month and the month of Jane's 5th visit, and there are 12 months in a year, we can determine that the month one year ago from the month of Jane's 5th visit is the same as the month of Jane's 5th visit minus one.

She ran out of eggs on the day she finished the last egg, which we will call \"Day X\".\n\nTo find Day X, we can subtract one from the total number of eggs and divide by the number of days:\n\n40 eggs \u00f7 1 egg/day = 40 days\n\nSo Jane ate eggs for 40 days.\n\nThe next day, after she ran out of eggs, was Day X+1.\n\nSince Jane ran out of eggs on Day X, and she ate eggs for X+1 day, we can calculate the number of days from May 9th to Day X+1:\n\nX+1 = 40 + X\nX = 39\n\nSo Jane ran out of eggs on Day 39.\n\nSince she ate eggs for 40 days, the day before she ran out of eggs was Day 38.\n\nNow we can add 24 hours to this date to find the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY:\n\n05/09/2017 + 24 hours = 05/10/2017\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 06/20/2017.<|im_end|>",

To find the date 10 days ago, we need to subtract 10 days from today's date.\n3. 1909 is a leap year, so we need to take that into account when calculating the number of days in February.\n4. February has 28 days in a normal year, and 29 days in a leap year. Since 1909 is a leap year, we add an extra day to February.\n5. Therefore, there are a total of 366 days in 1909, rather than the usual 365.\n6. Subtracting 10 days from Sep 9, 1909 gives us Aug 30, 1909 (which falls on a Sunday).\n7.
