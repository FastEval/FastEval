It is not a leap year.\n\nStep 4: Determine the number of days in the intervening years\nSince Jan 2, 1958 was a leap year, there were 366 days in 1958. In 1963, there were 365 days. Therefore, there were a total of 732 days (366 + 365) between Jan 2, 1958 and Jan 9, 1963.\n\nStep 5: Subtract the intervening days from the total number of days in 5 years\nFive years from Jan 2, 1958 is Jan 1, 1963. Therefore, there were a total of 1,865 days (5 x 365) between Jan 2, 1958 and Jan 1, 1963. Subtracting the 732 days from the 1,865 days gives us a remainder of 1,133 days.\n\nStep 6: Add the remainder to the date one week from today\nJan 9, 1963 was 4 days before the 5-year anniversary. So, we need to add 1,133 days to Jan 9, 1963, which gives us Feb 5, 1961 (1,133 + 9 = 1,142, and then subtract the leap days: 1,142 - 2 = 1,140, and then add the days: 1,140 + 5 = 1,145, and finally subtract 1961 from 1963: 1,145 - 3 = 1,142, which gives us Feb 5, 1961).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (F) 02/05/1961.",
