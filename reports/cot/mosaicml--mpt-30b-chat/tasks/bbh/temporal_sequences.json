Therefore, Sean couldn't have gone there after 4pm.\n\nStep 3:\nSean attended class from 11am to 2pm, so he couldn't have gone to the basketball court during that time.\n\nStep 4:\nSean worked out at the gym from 7am to 9am, but the gym is not the basketball court. So, we cannot conclude that Sean went to the basketball court during that time.\n\nStep 5:\nConsidering the information provided, we cannot determine with certainty when Sean went to the basketball court.

            "model_answer": "Step 1: We know that David woke up at 7am and the gas station was closed after 8pm. So, we can rule out the option (D) 7am to 12pm because that would mean David was at the gas station for 5 hours which is not possible since the gas station was closed after 8pm.\n\nStep 2: We also know that David was seen at different places between 7am and 6pm. We need to identify the slots of time when David was not seen at any of the places and could have gone to the gas station.\n\nStep 3: Between 7am and 12pm, David was seen waiting at the train station by Michael. So, we can rule out the period from 7am to 12pm.\n\nStep 4: Between 12pm and 2pm, David was seen sitting on a rooftop by Thomas. So, we can rule out the period from 12pm to 2pm.\n\nStep 5: Between 2pm and 3pm, David was seen getting a coffee at the cafe by Tiffany. So, we can rule out the period from 2pm to 3pm.\n\nStep 6: Between 3pm and 5pm, David was seen fixing their computer at the electronic store by James. So, we can rule out the period from 3pm to 5pm.\n\nStep 7: Between 5pm and 6pm, David was seen reading at the library by Mark. So, we can rule out the period from 5pm to 6pm.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the only time period left when David could have gone to the gas station is from 6pm to 8pm (option B).\n\nAnswer: (B)",
