            "model_answer": "Step-by-step explanation:\n\nA type-Ia supernova is a particular type of supernova that occurs when a white dwarf in a binary system reaches the Chandrasekhar limit, which is the maximum mass that a white dwarf can sustain through gravitational compaction before it undergoes a runaway nuclear fusion reaction and explodes.\n\nTherefore, the statement (A) is correct. Type-Ia supernovae do occur in binary systems.\n\nAs for the other statements:\n\n(B) It is not necessarily true that type-Ia supernovae only occur in young galaxies. While it is true that supernovae in general are more common in younger galaxies due to the higher rate of star formation, there is no strong correlation between the age of a galaxy and the occurrence of type-Ia supernovae.\n\n(C) Gamma-ray bursts are not exclusively associated with type-Ia supernovae. While some gamma-ray bursts have been observed to occur in conjunction with supernovae, there is no evidence to suggest that type-Ia supernovae are more likely to produce gamma-ray bursts than other types of supernovae.\n\n(D) Type-Ia supernovae do not necessarily produce high amounts of X-rays. While they do emit X-rays as part of their spectra, the amount of X-rays they produce can vary depending on various factors such as the distance from Earth and the specific properties of the supernova.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To estimate the distance of an object given its actual and apparent brightness, we can use the concept of luminosity and the service of absolute magnitude.\n\nThe absolute magnitude is the actual brightness of a celestial object when it is placed at a distance of 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years) from Earth. It's a standard measure used for stars and other celestial objects. The apparent magnitude, on the other hand, is the brightness of an object as seen from Earth, which depends on the object's luminosity, distance from Earth, and the observer's distance from the object.\n\nWe can use the following formula to calculate the apparent magnitude:\n\nApparent magnitude = 5 * log10(luminosity / distance^2) + 5\n\nNow, we need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that the apparent brightness of the object is equal to its actual brightness. This means that the object is at a distance of 1 parsec (3.26 light-years) from us, or any multiple of that distance (e.g., 2, 3, 4, etc.). If the object were closer than 1 parsec, its actual brightness would be greater than its apparent brightness. If it were farther, the opposite would be true.\n\nSo, if we know the actual brightness of an object and its apparent brightness, we can calculate its distance using this formula:\n\nDistance = 10^((apparent magnitude - 5) / 5) \\* 3.26 light-years\n\nFor example, if the apparent magnitude of an object is 6, we can calculate its distance:\n\nDistance = 10^((6 - 5) / 5) \\* 3.26 light-years = 10 light-years\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Its distance from you.",

Option (C) is the correct answer: \"Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.\"\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. The molecules that compose the Earth's atmosphere, such as nitrogen and oxygen, are colorless and do not have a blue-ish color, so option (A) is incorrect.\n2. The color of the Earth's oceans is blue, but the sky doesn't necessarily reflect that color, so option (B) is incorrect.\n3. The atmosphere does preferentially scatter short wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, more than it scatters longer wavelengths like red and orange. This means that more blue light reaches our eyes when we look up at the sky, making it appear blue.

When a comet of mass m impacts the Earth, it transfers some of its gravitational potential energy to the Earth's surface. The energy released in the impact can be expressed as the difference between the initial and final gravitational potential energies.\n\nThe initial gravitational potential energy of the comet is given by:\n\nU\u2080 = 0.5*m*(GM/R)\n\nSince the comet is at the minimum impact speed, it loses all its kinetic energy upon impact. Therefore, the final kinetic energy of the comet is 0. The final gravitational potential energy of the comet is also 0, as it becomes a part of the Earth's mass.\n\nThe total energy released in the impact is the difference between the initial and final potential energies:\n\n\u0394U = U\u2080 - U\u2081 = 0.5*m*(GM/R) - 0\n\nHence, the answer is (C).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the answer choices to see why they are incorrect:\n\n(A) m*v: This choice is incorrect because it represents the kinetic energy of the comet, which is not relevant to the problem.\n\n(B) 0.5*m/(R^3): This choice represents the gravitational potential energy of the comet, but it does not take into account the energy loss due to the impact.\n\n(D) 0.6*G(M^2)/R: This choice is also incorrect because it represents the gravitational force between the comet and the Earth, which is not relevant to the problem.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: To determine what happened to the \"lost\" water on Mars, we need to look at the possible mechanisms through which water can be lost from the planet. In this case, we know that some water is frozen in the soil and the ice caps, some was lost due to solar wind stripping, and the remaining water is thought to have been lost through another mechanism.\n\nStep 2: We are given four possible answers, each of which proposes a different mechanism for the loss of water. We need to evaluate each of these mechanisms to determine which one is the most likely explanation for the \"lost\" water.\n\nStep 3: (A) It was stripped away by the magnetic field when it rapidly decreased in strength: Mars has a weak magnetic field, which can cause solar wind to strip away the thinner atmosphere and any water vapor that might be present. However, this mechanism would not explain the loss of the original water, as the magnetic field has been weak for a long time.\n\nStep 4: (B) It was broken into hydrogen and oxygen by ultraviolet light and the hydrogen was lost through thermal escape: Ultraviolet light can break up water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen can then be lost to space through a process called thermal escape, in which high-energy particles are ejected from the planet's surface. However, this mechanism would also not explain the loss of the original water, as it would require a significant amount of ultraviolet light to break up the water molecules.\n\nStep 5: (C) It was consumed by a civilization of thirsty Martians: This is a tongue-in-cheek answer that is not intended to be taken seriously. There is no evidence of life on Mars, let alone a civilization capable of consuming large amounts of water.\n\nStep 6: (D) It was vaporized during a period of intense volcanism and was lost to space through thermal escape: This mechanism could potentially explain the loss of the original water on Mars. Volcanic activity can release large amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere, which can then be lost to space through thermal escape. This is the most likely explanation for the \"lost\" water on Mars.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

Lunar rocks are composed of fragments pulverized by many impacts (A) is true, but it doesn't necessarily indicate that the lunar rocks are older than Earth rocks.\n2. The Moon's surface is more heavily eroded than the Earth's surface (C) is also true, but this doesn't necessarily mean that lunar rocks are older than Earth rocks. Erosion can occur for various reasons, and the Moon and Earth have different geological processes at play.\n3. The Moon's surface has more impact craters than the Earth's surface (D) is true, but this doesn't necessarily indicate that lunar rocks are older than Earth rocks. Impact craters can form at any point in a planet's history, and the number of craters doesn't necessarily correlate with age.\n4. Radioactive dating of lunar samples (B) shows that they are older than Earth rocks. Lunar rocks have been dated using various radioactive isotopes, and the results indicate that they are on average older than Earth rocks. This is because the Moon formed around 4.5 billion years ago, while the Earth formed around 4.6 billion years ago. Therefore, any rocks formed during the early history of the Moon are likely to be older than Earth rocks, as the Earth has had more time to form and re-form its surface.",

When the Earth passes through the orbit of a comet, we are bombarded by sand-sized particles, which cause a meteor shower.\n\nHere's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Meteor showers occur when the Earth passes through a cloud of debris left behind by an asteroid or comet.\n2. Asteroids and comets are both types of small solar system bodies that orbit the Sun.\n3. When an asteroid or comet gets close to the Earth, the gravitational pull of the Earth can disrupt the object, causing it to break apart and release debris into space.\n4. This debris can include small rocks, dust, and ice particles.\n5. When the Earth passes through this debris field, the particles collide with the Earth's atmosphere and create the visible flashes of light we see as meteors.\n6. Depending on the size of the particles and the density of the debris field, a meteor shower can produce many meteors that appear to radiate from a single point in the sky.\n7. However, not all meteor showers radiate from a single point, and some meteor showers are caused by debris from comets rather than asteroids.\n8.
