By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

The region was already densely populated and relied more on internal agriculture and trade for sustenance.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while firearms were important for military expeditions and politics in Sub-Saharan Africa, the primary trade with Europeans was not for firearms but for other goods like textiles, manufactured goods, and later, slaves.\n\nOption C is partially correct because European merchants were one of the major buyers of slaves from Sub-Saharan Africa, but the trade was not the sole reason for their interactions. These interactions involved a range of goods and services exchanged in a complex network of trade.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because Muslim and Arab merchant princes were already established in the region and had trading relationships with Sub-Saharan Africans long before the European contact.

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",

It also mentions that the leaders of the mutiny aimed to destroy every white person they captured.\n\nPassage 2 states that violence was an essential component of the British presence in India, and that the British had constructed a monopoly of violence in India. The passage also states that the revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly and that the bodies of the British had certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.\n\nFrom these passages, we can see that the Cawnpore Massacre was viewed differently by the two authors.
