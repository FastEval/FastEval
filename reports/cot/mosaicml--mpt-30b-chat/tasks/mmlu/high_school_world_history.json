            "model_answer": "The passage is most associated with the formation of the non-aligned movement.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe passage is a quote from an Indonesian leader Sukarno, who was speaking at the Bandung Conference in 1955. The quote emphasizes the importance of peace and the need for the peoples of Asia and Africa to mobilize their strength in support of peace. This idea was central to the non-aligned movement, which was a group of countries that chose to remain neutral during the Cold War and refused to align themselves with either the Soviet Union or the United States.\n\nThe non-aligned movement was formed at the Bandung Conference in 1955, which was attended by representatives from 29 countries from Asia and Africa. The conference was a key event in the history of the non-aligned movement and led to the formation of the Belgrade Declaration, which laid out the principles of the movement.\n\nTherefore, the passage is most associated with the formation of the non-aligned movement. The answer is (A).",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

            "model_answer": "The argument in the passage is most closely related to option (B): Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.\n\nThe passage explains how Europe's focus on improving cannons and gunpowder weapons led to their military superiority over China, which instead focused on improving horse archer units. This shift in military technology and strategy played a significant role in European states' ability to colonize and dominate non-Western powers in the modern era.\n\nTherefore, the passage provides insight into the development of military superiority in Europe and the role of gunpowder weapons in that process. This aligns with option (B) rather than the other options, which focus on different aspects of global history.",

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "There is evidence in the passage that Ghanians were engaged in trade with Asia. It mentions that the city of Ghana is located beyond another country called Mali, which suggests that it is located in a region that was part of the extensive trans-Saharan trade network that linked West Africa with North Africa and the Mediterranean. Additionally, the passage mentions that the people of Ghana drank sweet water from wells and grew vegetables, suggesting that they had access to irrigation, which was necessary for agriculture in the region. Furthermore, the passage mentions that the king levied taxes on salt and other goods that were brought into the country, indicating that the Ghanians were engaged in trade with other regions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) The people in his court wore silk robes.\n\nSilk is a material that was prized in the medieval world, and was typically imported from Asia. The fact that people in the king's court wore silk robes suggests that the city of Ghana was engaged in trade with Asia, probably through the trans-Saharan trade network.",

A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.
