            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to look at data from a reliable source. The World Health Organization (WHO) is a good place to start. According to the WHO, as of 2016, approximately 39% of adult women and 39% of adult men aged 18 years or older were overweight.\n\nSince there are approximately equal numbers of women and men in this age group, we can calculate the overall percentage of overweight adults as follows:\n\n39% (overweight women) + 39% (overweight men) = 78%\n\nHowever, this is the percentage of adults who are overweight, not the percentage who are obese. The line between overweight and obesity can be difficult to draw, and the two terms are often used interchangeably, but technically, obesity refers to a higher level of body fat than overweight. In 2016, the WHO estimated that approximately 13% of women and 15% of men aged 18 years or older were obese.\n\nTo get an estimate of the percentage of adults who are either overweight or obese, we can add these two percentages together:\n\n39% (overweight women) + 39% (overweight men) + 13% (obese women) + 15% (obese men) = 90%\n\nTherefore, as of 2016, approximately 90% of adult women and men aged 18 years or older were either overweight or obese.\n\nAnswer: (C) 40%<|im_end|>",

The United States was second, with a total solar capacity of 44.4 GW, while Germany was third, with a total solar capacity of 40.3 GW.

Find the actual values of GDP per capita in 1950 and 2016 in Japan.\n2. Calculate the percentage increase in GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016.\n3. Determine the fold increase by taking the reciprocal of the percentage increase and subtracting 1.\n\nUnfortunately, I do not have access to the exact GDP per capita values for Japan in 1950 and 2016. However, using data from the World Bank, we can estimate the percentage increase in GDP per capita and the approximate fold increase.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Japan's GDP per capita in 2016 was $38,245 and in 1950 it was $622. This is an increase of 5,666%. Divide 100 by 5,666 to get the percentage increase: 178.27%.\n\nTo find the fold increase, take the reciprocal of the percentage increase and subtract 1:\n\n1 / (178.27% - 100%) = 6.26\n\nTherefore, the approximate fold increase in Japan's GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016 is between 5 and 6 times.
