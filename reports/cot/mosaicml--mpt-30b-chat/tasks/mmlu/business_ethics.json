Based on the given options, we can infer that the question is looking for a combination of a type of limitation/risk and a description of how it manifests in the collaboration. Let's analyze each option:\n\nOption (A): Power imbalance, Benefits, Hoodwinked\n\n* Power imbalance: This refers to a situation where one party (either the business or the CSO) has more power or control over the relationship. This could lead to a lack of equality or fairness in the collaboration.\n* Benefits: This refers to a situation where one party gains more from the collaboration than the other. This could lead to an unequal distribution of benefits or an imbalance in the relationship.\n* Hoodwinked: This refers to a situation where one party is deceived or misled by the other. This could happen if one party takes advantage of the other or if there is a lack of transparency in the collaboration.\n\nOption (B): Power imbalance, Resources, Co-opted\n\n* Power imbalance: See explanation above.\n* Resources: This refers to a situation where one party possesses more resources (e.g., financial, human, or technological) than the other. This could lead to an imbalance in the collaboration, with the party with more resources having more influence or control.\n* Co-opted: This refers to a situation where one party is absorbed or taken over by the other. This could happen if the party with more resources is able to exert too much control over the collaboration or if the party with fewer resources is unable to assert its independence.\n\nOption (C): Informational asymmetries, Benefits, Hoodwinked\n\n* Informational asymmetries: This refers to a situation where one party has more information than the other. This could lead to an imbalance in the collaboration, with the party with more information having an unfair advantage.\n* Benefits: See explanation above.\n* Hoodwinked: See explanation above.\n\nOption (D): Informational asymmetries, Resources, Co-opted\n\n* Informational asymmetries: See explanation above.\n* Resources: See explanation above.\n* Co-opted: See explanation above.\n\nBased on the explanations above, the best fit for the question is option (C): Informational asymmetries, Benefits, Hoodwinked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: C (Informational asymmetries, Benefits, Hoodwinked).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of corporate profit maximization and the major normative theories in ethics.\n\nCorporate profit maximization is the act of maximizing profits for a corporation. This typically involves making decisions that increase revenue and decrease expenses in order to generate the highest possible profit.\n\nNow let's look at the major normative theories in ethics:\n\n1. Hedonistic Utilitarianism: This theory holds that the right action is the one that maximizes pleasure or minimizes pain. However, it is not directly related to corporate profit maximization since the focus is on individual preferences and not on maximizing profits for a corporation.\n2. Preference Utilitarianism: This theory holds that the right action is the one that maximizes the satisfaction of individuals's preferences. Again, it does not focus on maximizing profits for a corporation.\n3. The Categorical Imperative: This theory, proposed by Immanuel Kant, holds that the right action is the one that can be universally applied as a moral principle. It does not directly relate to corporate profit maximization since the focus is on individual actions and not on corporate decision making.\n4. Ethics of Care: This theory holds that the right action is the one that takes into account the needs and well-being of others. While it may seem related to maximizing profits for a corporation since it focuses on the well-being of others, it is not directly focused on profit maximization.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most similar normative theory to corporate profit maximization is:\n\n(D) ethics of care.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that corporate profit maximization is not directly prescribed by any normative theory. It is a business strategy that may or may not align with the principles of different normative theories depending on the specific circumstances.",

He argued that businesses should not be concerned with social issues or making political statements, as this would distract from their primary goal of maximizing profits.\n\nWhile Friedman's views have been controversial and challenged by others, he has had a significant impact on contemporary business practices and corporate governance.
