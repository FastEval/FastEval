            "model_answer": "To find the index of <p> in S_5, we need to find the number of permutations in S_5 that are greater than or equal to p in order. We can do this by using the concept of cycles and cycle indices.\n\nA permutation in S_5 can be represented as a product of disjoint cycles. For example, (1, 2, 3)(4, 5) can be represented as a product of two cycles, (1, 2, 3) and (4, 5). Each cycle is denoted by its length in parentheses.\n\nIn this case, p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3). We can break this down into its cycles:\n\np = (1, 2)(5)(4)(2, 3)\n\nNotice that the cycle (1, 2) has a length of 2, and the cycle (2, 3) has a length of 2. Also notice that the cycle (5) has a length of 1.\n\nTo find the index of p in S_5, we must count the number of permutations in S_5 that have the same cycles as p or have longer cycles.\n\nThere are three possible cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: p itself\nThere is only one permutation in S_5 that has the same cycles as p, which is p itself. Therefore, the index of p in S_5 is 1.\n\nCase 2: Permutations with longer cycles\nWe must consider permutations with longer cycles in S_5. According to the cycle notation, a cycle of length n can be represented as (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). Therefore, we must consider permutations with cycles of length 2 or longer.\n\nThere are two possible cases for permutations with longer cycles:\n\nCase 2.1: (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3)\nIn this case, we have a permutation with cycles of length 2 and 3. There are 2! = 2 permutations of cycles of length 2, and 3! = 6 permutations of cycles of length 3. Therefore, there are 2 x 6 = 12 permutations in S_5 with this cycle structure.\n\nCase 2.2: (1, 2)(5, 4)(2, 3)\nIn this case, we have a permutation with cycles of length 2 and 2. There are 2! = 2 permutations of cycles of length 2, and 2! = 2 permutations of cycles of length 2. Therefore, there are 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 permutations in S_5 with this cycle structure.\n\nTherefore, the total number of permutations in S_5 with longer cycles than p is 12 + 8 = 20.\n\nCase 3: Permutations with shorter cycles\nTo count the number of permutations in S_5 with shorter cycles than p, we can use the following formula:\n\nNumber of permutations with cycles shorter than p = Number of permutations without cycles = 1\n\nTherefore, the total number of permutations in S_5 with shorter cycles than p is 1.\n\nTaking the total number of permutations in S_5 with longer or shorter cycles than p, we get:\n\nIndex of p in S_5 = 1 (Case 1) + 20 (Case 2) + 1 (Case 3) = 22\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 8.<|im_end|>",

For example, in the group of integers modulo 15, the element 5 has order 15 since 5^15 \u2261 5 (mod 15). Now, since there is only one element of order 1 (itself), the other 8 elements in the group must have orders that divide 15. Therefore, these 8 elements must have orders 2, 3, 5, or 15/2 = 7. Thus, if a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15 or a multiple of 15.\n\nStatement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nExplanation: Statement 2 is not necessarily true. Let's consider the group of integers modulo 15 again. This group has 15 elements in total, and we already found that 8 of them have order 15 or a multiple of 15. The remaining 7 elements have orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, which are not multiples of 15. In this case, the group has more than 8 elements of order 15 (8 elements with order 15 and 7 elements with other orders), but it still has only 15 elements in total.

That is, it takes the addition and multiplication of elements in one ring to the addition and multiplication of elements in another ring in a way that respects the algebraic properties of the rings.\n\nNow, let's consider Statement 1. A ring homomorphism is one-to-one (injective) if every element in the domain of the homomorphism is mapped to a unique element in the codomain. In other words, if two elements in the domain are equal, then their images in the codomain must also be equal. The kernel of a ring homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that are mapped to the zero element in the codomain.\n\nSo, if the kernel of a ring homomorphism is {0}, it means that every element in the domain is mapped to a unique element in the codomain. This implies that the homomorphism is one-to-one, since there are no two elements in the domain that are mapped to the same element in the codomain.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is True.\n\nNow let's consider Statement 2. An ideal in a ring is a non-empty subset of the ring that is closed under addition and multiplication by elements in the ring. That is, if an element is in the ideal, and if another element is multiplied by it or added to it, then the result is still in the ideal.\n\nQ is an ideal in R if every element in Q can be multiplied by any element in R and the result is still in Q.
