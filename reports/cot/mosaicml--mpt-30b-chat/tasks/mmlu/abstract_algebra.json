We already have the roots sqrt(2), sqrt(3), and sqrt(18), but we need to check for any further roots.\n\nFirst, let's check if any of the roots are algebraic integers. We know that 2, 3, and 18 are integers, so sqrt(2), sqrt(3), and sqrt(18) are all algebraic integers. Therefore, we can begin by finding the minimal polynomial for each of these roots.\n\nFor sqrt(2), the minimal polynomial is just x^2 - 2. For sqrt(3), the minimal polynomial is x^2 - 3. For sqrt(18), the minimal polynomial can be factored as (x - sqrt(6))(x + sqrt(6)).\n\nNow, let's consider the field Q(sqrt(2)). Since sqrt(3) is not a root of the minimal polynomial for sqrt(2), it is not independent, and Q(sqrt(2)) has degree 1.\n\nNext, let's consider the field Q(sqrt(3)). Since sqrt(2) and sqrt(18) are not roots of the minimal polynomial for sqrt(3), they are not independent, and Q(sqrt(3)) has degree 1.\n\nFinally, let's consider the field Q(sqrt(18)).

A ring homomorphism is said to be one-to-one if each element in the domain is mapped to a unique element in the codomain. In this case, the kernel of the ring homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that are mapped to the zero element in the codomain.
