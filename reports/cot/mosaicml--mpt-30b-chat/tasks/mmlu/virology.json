            "model_answer": "There are currently 10 known human polyomaviruses, which are classified into five species: BK, JC, KIP, MC, and SIM. BK polyomavirus is prevalent in the world population, while JC polyomavirus is primarily associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in immunocompromised individuals. KIP polyomavirus has been identified in kidneys of patients with kidney disease, MC polyomavirus has been associated with tracheobronchial carcinomas, and SIM polyomavirus has been linked to various cancer types, including skin, anal, and head and neck cancers.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the history of AIDS activism in the U.S. and its impact on various aspects of the healthcare system.\n\nAIDS activism in the U.S. emerged in response to the federal government's inadequate response to the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s. Activists demanded more research funding, better treatment options, and an end to stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS. They organized protests, vigils, and marches, and formed advocacy groups to raise awareness and pressure policymakers to take action.\n\nOne of the key achievements of AIDS activism in the U.S. was the passage of the AIDS Research and Services Act in 1989, which provided funding for AIDS research and services. This was a major victory for activists, who had been pressing Congress to provide more funding for AIDS research and treatment.\n\nAs a result of the activism, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also reformed its policies to speed up the approval of new drugs for people with HIV/AIDS. Activists pushed the FDA to adopt accelerated approval procedures and to allow the use of investigational drugs in emergency situations.\n\nIn addition to these reforms, AIDS activism also led to changes in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S. Many doctors and nurses were inspired by the activism and became more engaged in HIV/AIDS care and treatment. The activism also resulted in increased awareness and education about HIV/AIDS, which helped to reduce stigma and discrimination.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (D) All of the above.<|im_end|>",

Contingency management is often used as a strategy of last resort for individuals with substance use disorders, as it can be effective in reducing heroin use, cocaine use, and other high-risk behaviors.\n3. Paying drug users for negative urine specimens is not a form of contingency management, as it does not reward positive behaviors.\n4. Paying sex workers to use condoms is not a form of contingency management, as it does not directly address high-risk behaviors.\n5.

They are a common cause of viral gastroenteritis, particularly in children. Astroviruses are usually transmitted through the fecal-oral route or by direct contact with an infected person.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Acute pneumonia: Acute pneumonia is not a typical symptom of astroviral infection. Astroviruses primarily cause gastroenteritis, which is an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n(B) Gastroenteritis in children: Correct.

Astroviruses primarily cause gastroenteritis, and hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver.\n\n(D) Rashes: Rashes are not a typical symptom of astroviral infection.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understanding the Adaptive Immune System\n\nThe adaptive immune system is a complex system in the human body responsible for fighting pathogens and diseases. It is composed of two main types of cells: B cells and T cells. These cells work together to recognize and destroy specific pathogens.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the Options\n\nWe need to identify which of the given options (A) antibodies, (B) T cells, (C) memory T cells, or (D) clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells is the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system.\n\nStep 3: Evaluating the Options\n\n(A) Antibodies: Antibodies are proteins produced by B cells that can neutralize pathogens by binding to specific epitopes on their surface. They are an essential part of the adaptive immune system but may not be the most special characteristic.\n\n(B) T cells: T cells are a type of white blood cell that can recognize and kill infected cells. They play a crucial role in the adaptive immune system. However, like antibodies, they may not be the most special characteristic.\n\n(C) Memory T cells: Memory T cells are a subset of T cells that can quickly respond to a previously encountered pathogen. They have a \"memory\" of the pathogen and can mount a faster and more effective immune response upon re-exposure. Memory T cells are an essential part of the adaptive immune system as they provide long-term protection against pathogens.\n\n(D) Clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells: Clonal expansion refers to the rapid multiplication of identical immune cells that can recognize and fight a specific pathogen. This process involves the activation and proliferation of pre-existing immune cells that have encountered the pathogen before. Clonal expansion is a key feature of the adaptive immune system as it allows for a rapid and robust response to pathogens.\n\nStep 4: Identifying the Most Special Characteristic\n\nBased on the evaluation, the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is the clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells. This process allows the immune system to respond quickly and in large numbers to a specific pathogen, providing an efficient and effective defense against infections.\n\nAnswer: (D)<|im_end|>",
