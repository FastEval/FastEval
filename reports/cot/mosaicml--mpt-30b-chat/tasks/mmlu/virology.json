            "model_answer": "AIDS activism in the U.S. played a significant role in shaping the response to the AIDS epidemic. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the impacts of AIDS activism on various aspects of the U.S. health care system:\n\n1. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reforms: AIDS activists were instrumental in pushing the FDA to speed up the approval process for new drugs and treatments. They argued that the slow approval process was denying AIDS patients access to potentially life-saving treatments. As a result, the FDA implemented new policies to expedite the review and approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases. This led to the approval of new treatments for AIDS, which significantly improved the prognosis for people with the disease. Therefore, option (A) is correct.\n2. Easier access to investigational drugs: AIDS activists also pressured the government and pharmaceutical companies to make experimental drugs available to people with AIDS who were not eligible for clinical trials. This was done through the establishment of \"compassionate use\" programs, which allowed patients to access experimental treatments that had not yet been approved by the FDA. This ensured that patients had access to promising new treatments that might otherwise have been unavailable to them. Therefore, option (B) is also correct.\n3. Changes in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S.: AIDS activists also influenced the way medicine was practiced in the U.S. by raising awareness about the importance of patient-centered care and patient advocacy. They challenged the medical establishment's reluctance to address the needs of people with AIDS and forced healthcare providers to reevaluate their attitudes and practices. This led to a more patient-centered approach to healthcare, which benefitted not only people with AIDS but also other patients who faced stigmatization and discrimination in the healthcare system. Therefore, option (C) is also correct.\n\nGiven these impacts, the final answer is: (D) All of the above.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to gather and analyze data on mortality rates caused by different diseases globally.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), respiratory infections, such as pneumonia and influenza, are the leading cause of mortality globally, accounting for approximately 16% of all deaths worldwide in 2019. Diarrheal diseases, which include dehydration caused by diarrhea, are the fourth leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 4.5% of all deaths in 2019.\n\nMalaria and tuberculosis are also significant contributors to global mortality. Malaria is responsible for approximately 409,000 deaths worldwide in 2019, while tuberculosis is responsible for approximately 1.5 million deaths globally in 2019.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer to this question depends on several factors, including the availability of safe water and the level of education in the country where the infant is born. In general, exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) because it provides newborns with the best possible nutrition and protection against infections.\n\nHowever, in situations where safe water is not readily available and the level of education is low, formula feeding may be a more appropriate option. This is because formula feeding can provide the necessary nutrients for growth and development, and it can also help to prevent the spread of infections. Additionally, formula feeding can be more convenient for mothers who may not have access to safe water or who may not have the knowledge or resources to properly clean and prepare breastmilk.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether to exclusively breastfeed or formula feed a newborn in a country with limited access to safe water and low levels of education should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific circumstances of the individual infant and their family. A healthcare professional or other trained expert can provide guidance on the best course of action.",

Option A is incorrect because contingency management is not necessarily a strategy of last resort. It can be used at any point during treatment or behavior change efforts.\n3. Option B is incorrect because paying drug users for negative urine specimens is not a form of contingency management.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is (D) clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells. Here's why:\n\nThe adaptive immune system is a highly specialized system that allows an organism to recognize and respond to specific pathogens. It is made up of two main components: B cells and T cells. Both B cells and T cells can recognize and respond to specific antigens, but they do so in different ways.\n\nAntibodies are produced by B cells and are used to neutralize pathogens by binding to them. T cells, on the other hand, are responsible for killing infected cells and promoting inflammation. While both antibodies and T cells are important components of the adaptive immune system, they are not the most special characteristic.\n\nMemory T cells are a subset of T cells that can remember previous encounters with pathogens, allowing for a faster and more effective immune response upon subsequent exposures. While memory T cells are important for the adaptive immune system, they are not the most special characteristic.\n\nClonal expansion is the process by which a single pre-existing B or T cell can rapidly multiply and differentiate into a large number of identical cells that are all capable of recognizing and responding to the same antigen. This is the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system because it allows the immune system to generate a highly specific and effective response to a pathogen, even if the pathogen mutates or changes over time.\n\nIn summary, the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells.",
