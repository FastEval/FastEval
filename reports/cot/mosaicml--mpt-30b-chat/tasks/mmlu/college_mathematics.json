Therefore, x = 2 is a solution.\n\nStep 2: Determine the solutions in the interval [0, 1]\nTo find the solutions in the interval [0, 1], we need to analyze the other factor, x - 2. This factor is equal to zero at x = 2, which is outside the interval [0, 1]. Since the equation is of the form f(x) = 0, where f(x) = x - 2, there are no real solutions in the interval [0, 1].\n\nStep 3: Determine the solutions outside the interval [0, 1]\nWe already found that x = 2 is a solution outside the interval [0, 1]. To find more solutions, we can analyze the factored equation (e^x + 1)(x - 2) = 0. Since e^x + 1 > 0 for all x, the equation is equal to zero when x - 2 = 0, which gives us x = 2.
