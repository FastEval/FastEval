            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically, we need to consider the characteristics of these economies. Subsistence economies are characterized by small-scale production for local consumption, with little or no surplus for trade. In such economies, people primarily focus on meeting their basic needs, and economic development is not a priority.\n\nAdvanced economies, on the other hand, have a more complex structure, with specialized sectors, a division of labor, and a higher level of productivity. They are also more integrated into the global economy, with access to advanced technologies and a well-developed financial system.\n\nGiven this context, we can eliminate options A and B since subsistence economies do not necessarily require a currency or a well-connected transportation infrastructure to function. Option C is also unlikely to be the main factor since government activity alone is not sufficient for economic development.\n\nThat leaves us with option D, a banking service. Subsistence economies often lack access to formal financial services, which can limit their ability to save, invest, and access credit. Without a banking service, it can be difficult for these economies to develop a more advanced economic structure, as they cannot accumulate capital or leverage resources to expand their production.\n\nTherefore, the main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically is the lack of a banking service, which is why option D is the correct answer.<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The tendency for a population to continue to grow long after replacement fertility has been achieved is called (D) demographic momentum.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. To answer this question, we need to identify which option among (A), (B), (C), and (D) describes the phenomenon of a population continuing to grow after replacement fertility has been achieved.\n2. Replacement fertility is the level of fertility required for a population to maintain its size from one generation to the next, assuming no migration. In other words, it is the level of fertility necessary to replace the population with new individuals.\n3. When a population's fertility rate is above replacement fertility, it is expected to grow over time. However, not all populations continue to grow indefinitely - some eventually reach a plateau and stabilize.\n4. The term we are looking for should therefore describe a situation where a population continues to grow after replacement fertility has been achieved, and rules out options (A) and (B) which do not relate to this phenomenon.\n5. Option (C) suggests a plateau, which is not what we are looking for.\n6. Therefore, the answer must be (D) demographic momentum, which refers to the tendency for a population to continue to grow long after replacement fertility has been achieved due to factors such as high fertility, low mortality, or immigration.<|im_end|>",

            "question": "The tendency for migration to decrease with distance is called\n\n(A) push factors.\n(B) pull factors.\n(C) distance decay.\n(D) migration selectivity.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we first need to understand the concept of migration and the factors that influence it. Migration refers to the movement of individuals from one place to another, typically across geographic boundaries. This movement can be triggered by various factors, such as socioeconomic, political, or environmental conditions.\n\nOne of the key factors that influence migration is distance. Generally, the farther away a destination is, the less likely individuals are to migrate to it. This tendency for migration to decrease with distance is called distance decay.\n\nDistance decay is a term used in geography and economics to describe the inverse relationship between the likelihood of migration and the distance to the destination. The term \"decay\" is used because the likelihood of migration decreases as the distance increases, similar to how the intensity of a signal decreases as it travels through space.\n\nDistance decay is often used in migration studies to analyze the factors that influence the decision to migrate. It can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as transportation costs, time spent traveling, and the availability of information about the destination.\n\nNow let's consider the options provided:\n\n(A) Push factors are the factors that drive individuals to leave their place of origin, such as economic hardship, political repression, or natural disasters. They do not directly relate to distance decay.\n\n(B) Pull factors are the factors that attract individuals to a destination, such as job opportunities, higher wages, or better living conditions. They do not directly relate to distance decay.\n\n(C) Distance decay.\n\n(D) Migration selectivity is the tendency for individuals to choose certain destinations over others based on factors such as cultural affinity, language, or social networks. It does not directly relate to distance decay.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Distance decay.<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "In Burgess's concentric zone model of urban form, the zones are arranged in a specific order, with each zone having a certain level of residential and commercial activity.\n\nThe model consists of four zones:\n\n1. The central zone (First zone): This zone contains the city's central business district and is the most active and densely populated zone. It has high residential and commercial activity.\n2. The intermediate zone (Second zone): This zone is located just outside the central zone and is characterized by high levels of residential activity and some commercial activity. It is also known as the transitional zone.\n3. The tertiary zone (Third zone): This zone is located further out from the central zone and is characterized by a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial activity. It is also known as the multifunctional zone.\n4. The quaternary zone (Fourth zone): This zone is located on the outskirts of the city and is characterized by low levels of residential and commercial activity. It is also known as the suburban zone.\n\nNow, based on the description of the zones provided, we can determine which zone contains low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration. This type of area would be characterized by low levels of residential and commercial activity, which suggests that it would be located in the quaternary zone (Fourth zone).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Fourth.<|im_end|>",

Therefore, this option can be eliminated.\n\nStep 3: (B) The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide: This statement is also incorrect because according to the International Labor Organization, the percentage of women in the economically active population has been increasing globally.\n\nStep 4: (C) The percentage of women in the total labor force declined: This statement is inconclusive because it depends on the region and time period being considered. In some regions, the percentage of women in the labor force has increased, while in others it has decreased. Therefore, we cannot eliminate this option based on the information provided.\n\nStep 5: (D) Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia: This statement is incorrect because according to the OECD, on average, men work more hours per day than women in most countries.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine which factor is not a pull factor of migration, we need to understand the concept of pull factors. Pull factors are the attractive forces that drive people to migrate to a particular destination. These factors can be economic, social, or cultural, and they can vary from person to person.\n\nBased on this understanding, we can analyze each of the given options to determine if they are pull factors of migration:\n\nA) Safety: Safety is a crucial factor that influences people's decisions to migrate. People may move to a new location to escape violence, political instability, or natural disasters. Therefore, safety can be considered a pull factor of migration.\n\nB) Better climate: Climate is a significant factor that affects people's decisions to migrate. People may move to areas with more favorable climates for various reasons, such as agriculture, tourism, or health. Therefore, better climate can be considered a pull factor of migration.\n\nC) Better schools: Education is an essential factor that influences people's decisions to migrate. People may move to areas with better educational opportunities for their children. Therefore, better schools can be considered a pull factor of migration.\n\nD) Overcrowding: Overcrowding is not a direct pull factor of migration. Overcrowding can be a consequence of migration, not a reason for it. People may migrate to a particular destination due to other factors, such as job opportunities, and then find themselves living in overcrowded conditions. Overcrowding can lead to social, economic, and environmental problems, which may cause people to leave the area. However, overcrowding itself is not a pull factor of migration.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) safety.<|im_end|>",
