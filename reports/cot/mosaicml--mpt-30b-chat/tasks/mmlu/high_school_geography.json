            "question": "The main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically is the lack of\n\n(A) a currency.\n(B) a well-connected transportation infrastructure.\n(C) government activity.\n(D) a banking service.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) a banking service.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Subsistence economies are those in which people meet their basic needs through their own labor and the produce of their own land. In such economies, most people produce their own goods and services, and there is little or no trading with other communities.\n2. In order for an economy to advance beyond subsistence level and become more complex, there needs to be increased production and exchange of goods and services. This requires a more sophisticated division of labor, where people specialize in producing certain goods or services and trade them for others.\n3. One of the key enablers of a more complex economy is the existence of a banking system, which allows people and businesses to store and exchange value in the form of currency.\n4. Without a banking service, people in a subsistence economy would have to rely on barter or other forms of direct exchange to trade their goods and services. This can be limiting, as it may be difficult to find someone who wants or needs the goods or services that you have to offer in exchange for what you want.\n5. With a banking service, people can store their wealth in the form of currency and use it to buy goods and services from others. This allows for a much greater division of labor and more specialized production, which can lead to economic growth and development.\n6. Therefore, the lack of a banking service is one of the main factors preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) Demographic momentum.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. To determine the answer, we need to understand the concept being described.\n2. The question describes a tendency for a population to continue to grow long after replacement fertility has been achieved.\n3. Replacement fertility is the level of fertility required for a population to maintain its size from one generation to the next without any immigration or emigration.\n4. When the fertility rate falls below replacement fertility, the population size will begin to decline over time.\n5. However, sometimes the population continues to grow even after replacement fertility has been achieved.\n6. This continuing growth is called demographic momentum.\n7. Demographic momentum occurs because of factors such as high birth rates in the past, long life expectancy, and stable or increasing economic growth.\n8. These factors lead to a large population size, which in turn creates positive feedback loops that further increase the population.\n9. The other options in the list do not accurately describe this phenomenon.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Demographic momentum.",

            "question": "The tendency for migration to decrease with distance is called\n\n(A) push factors.\n(B) pull factors.\n(C) distance decay.\n(D) migration selectivity.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "\"Distance decay\" refers to the tendency for migration to decrease with distance.\n\nThe reason for this is that the likelihood of an individual migrating decreases as the distance between their current location and their potential destination increases. There are several factors that can contribute to this phenomenon, such as the cost of travel, the availability of information about distant locations, and the difficulty of establishing oneself in a new place. As a result, individuals are less likely to migrate to destinations that are farther away, and this tendency is known as \"distance decay.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: (C) distance decay.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand the different forms of migration.\n\n1. Chain migration: This is a form of migration in which immigrants are sponsored by relatives or family members who are already living in the host country. This form of migration is less likely to be practiced by farm workers from another country, as they are more likely to be recruited by farmers or agricultural companies.\n2. Cluster migration: This is a form of migration in which people from the same region or community move to a new location together. Farm workers are less likely to migrate in groups, so this form of migration is also less likely to be practiced by farm workers from another country.\n3. Circular migration: This is a form of migration in which people move between their home country and host country for a specific reason, such as work or study. Farm workers from another country may practice this form of migration, as they may travel to the host country for seasonal work and return to their home country during non-harvest seasons.\n4. International migration: This is a form of migration in which people move from one country to another, across an international border. Farm workers from another country are most likely to practice this form of migration, as they are moving from their home country to another country to work as farm workers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) International migration.",

            "correct_answer": 3,

Early settlements and high population density along coastlines and rivers can be attributed to factors that provided resources and protection from natural disasters.\n2. Mediterranean climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters, which makes the land conducive to agriculture and support a diverse ecosystem.\n3. Areas with Mediterranean climate are typically located along the coasts and near rivers, which provide easy access to water for drinking, cleaning, and irrigation.\n4. Limited forest cover can be found in areas with a long history of human habitation, as forests are cleared for agriculture, housing, and infrastructure development.\n5. Growth of manufacturing is a more recent phenomenon and does not necessarily explain the pattern of early settlements and high population density along coastlines and rivers.\n6. Access to trade routes is important for the growth and prosperity of a region, but it does not necessarily explain the pattern of early settlements and high population density along coastlines and rivers, as such settlements predate the development of trade routes.\n7. Therefore, the best explanation for early settlements and high population density along coastlines and rivers is the Mediterranean climate, which provides a favorable environment for human habitation and agriculture.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Mediterranean climate.",
