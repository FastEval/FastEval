            "model_answer": "To determine the structure of the United Nations Security Council, we need to look at its composition and the powers of its members.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has 15 members in total. Five of these members are permanent members with veto power, and the remaining ten are non-permanent members who serve for two-year terms.\n\nThe five permanent members of the Security Council are the United States, China, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France. These countries have veto power, which means that they can single-handedly block any resolution or action proposed by the Council.\n\nThe ten non-permanent members of the Security Council are elected for two-year terms by the General Assembly of the United Nations. These members do not have veto power, but they can participate in debates and vote on resolutions proposed by the Council.\n\nGiven this information, the correct structure of the United Nations Security Council is:\n\n(A) 5 permanent members with veto power, 10 rotating members with no veto power",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The Gulf of Tonkin resolution was a joint resolution passed by the United States Congress on August 7 and August 8, 1964, after the United States Navy reported that North Vietnamese naval units had attacked American ships in the Gulf of Tonkin. The resolution authorized President Lyndon B. Johnson to take all necessary measures to protect US troops in Vietnam and to retaliate against North Vietnam.\n\nThe significance of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. It provided legal justification for US involvement in the Vietnam War, as it authorized the president to take military action in response to the alleged attack.\n2. It enabled President Johnson to escalate the US involvement in the Vietnam War, as it provided him with the authority to use military force without a formal declaration of war by Congress.\n3. It reflected the overwhelming support in Congress for the use of military force in Vietnam, as the resolution was passed with only two dissenting votes in the Senate and one dissenting vote in the House of Representatives.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is (A): It allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam.",

They can include terrorists, organized crime groups, and drug traffickers. These groups often pose threats to states by engaging in activities that undermine the stability and security of those states.\n\nChina is not a nonstate actor, as it is a state with a government and formal structures.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand what American exceptionalism is. American exceptionalism is the idea that the United States is uniquely virtuous and exceptional among nations, with a special mission to lead the world toward democracy, freedom, and prosperity. It has been a core part of American identity and foreign policy since the early days of the republic.\n\nThe Cold War was a geopolitical conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union that lasted from 1947 to 1991. It had significant implications for American exceptionalism.\n\nOption A: It ended the influence of American exceptionalism entirely\n\nWhile the collapse of the Soviet Union did mark the end of the Cold War, it did not entirely end the influence of American exceptionalism. The idea of American exceptionalism has remained a part of American identity and foreign policy, albeit in different forms and with different emphases.\n\nOption B: Exceptionalism was enhanced by America's status as the 'leader of the free world'\n\nDuring the Cold War, the United States emerged as the \"leader of the free world,\" fighting against communism and promoting democracy and capitalism. This role reinforced the idea of American exceptionalism, as the United States saw itself as responsible for protecting freedom and democracy not just at home but around the world.\n\nOption C: The extension of American power globally challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism\n\nThe extension of American power globally, particularly through the deployment of military force, challenged core assumptions of American exceptionalism. The idea that the United States was an innocent, peace-loving nation that only used force in self-defense was challenged by its involvement in conflicts such as the Vietnam War and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nBased on these options, the best answer is (D) Both B and C. The Cold War enhanced the idea of American exceptionalism through the United States' role as the \"leader of the free world,\" but it also challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism through the extension of American power globally.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Franklin D. Roosevelt was president of the United States during the 1930s, a time when the country was facing the Great Depression.\nStep 2: During his presidency, Roosevelt pursued a policy of isolationism, which meant avoiding involvement in international affairs and focusing on domestic issues.\nStep 3: One of the reasons for Roosevelt's isolationist stance was his belief that internal reform rather than international negotiation was the key to economic regeneration of the US. He believed that by focusing on domestic issues, such as creating jobs and stimulating the economy, the US could recover from the Great Depression.\nStep 4: Another reason for Roosevelt's isolationist stance was his belief that German domination of Europe would be in US interests. He feared that any attempt by the US to intervene in European affairs could lead to a conflict with Germany, which was rapidly becoming a powerful military force.\nStep 5: However, it should be noted that Roosevelt's isolationist stance was not entirely rigid. He eventually became more interventionist in his foreign policy as he believed that the US needed to play a more active role in world affairs to ensure its security and prosperity.\nStep 6: Based on the above reasoning, option (A) is the correct answer.",
