            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The term for a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome of negotiations between parties is (B) Satisficing.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning and explanation:\n\n1. In negotiations, parties often aim to achieve the best possible outcome for themselves while accommodating the other party's interests.\n2. However, in some cases, negotiators may settle for a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome, rather than risk jeopardizing the negotiation or failing to reach an agreement altogether.\n3. This concept is known as \"satisficing,\" which is a combination of the words \"satisfy\" and \"sufficing.\" It was first coined by economist Herbert Simon in the 1950s.\n4. Satisficing refers to the practice of settling for a solution that is good enough, rather than striving for the optimal solution.\n5. In negotiation context, bargaining and compromising are also common terms used to describe the process of negotiating and finding a mutually acceptable solution. However, satisficing specifically refers to the mindset of being content with a sub-optimal solution that meets the basic needs or requirements of both parties.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Satisficing.",

While heuristics can be helpful in making quick and efficient decisions, they can also lead to biases and errors in judgment. One common type of heuristic-related bias is called the \"availability heuristic,\" which refers to the tendency to make decisions based on the most readily available or memorable information. Other types of heuristic-related biases include the \"representativeness heuristic\" and the \"anchoring heuristic.\"",

She implemented conservative policies that transformed the UK's economy and society, making it more market-oriented. She is widely regarded as a transformational leader.\n\nMikhail Gorbachov: He was the leader of the Soviet Union from 1985 to 1991.

He is also regarded as a transformational leader.\n\nNelson Mandela: He was the President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He led the struggle against apartheid and championed reconciliation between different racial groups in South Africa.

            "model_answer": "A Gantt chart is a type of:\n\n(B) Work schedule design\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. A Gantt chart is a graphical representation of a project schedule, often used in project management. It illustrates the tasks that need to be completed, the dependencies between them, and the timeline for the project.\n2. In a Gantt chart, the horizontal axis represents time, while the vertical axis represents the different tasks or activities that need to be completed. Each task is represented by a horizontal bar, which shows the duration of the task.\n3. The purpose of a Gantt chart is to provide a visual representation of the project schedule, making it easy for project managers and team members to understand the scope of the project, the tasks that need to be completed, and the timeline for completion.\n4. Since the main focus of a Gantt chart is on the schedule and the duration of the tasks, it can be considered a type of work schedule design.\n5. It is not a type of work flow design, as a Gantt chart does not show the logical flow of the tasks or the sequence in which they need to be completed. Likewise, it is not a type of work rate design or work output design, as these are not relevant to the purpose of a Gantt chart.",
