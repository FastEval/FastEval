Morality is subjective, and what is considered wrong in one culture or community may be considered acceptable in another.

This behavior is generally considered wrong because it involves stealing, which is considered morally wrong in most societies.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character went to work even though they were not scheduled to work.
