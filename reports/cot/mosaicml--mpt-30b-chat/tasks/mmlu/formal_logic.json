            "model_answer": "The argument is as follows:\n\nPremise 1: It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients.\nPremise 2: The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.\nPremise 3: Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nThe conclusion is: (D) It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe argument presents three premises that support the conclusion that it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious and teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts. The first premise states that we observe weakened intelligence due to emotions in our everyday patients, and it is hard not to verify the same in our peers. The second premise explains that the arrogance of our consciousness, which is a part of the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes. The third premise concludes that because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious and teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts. Overall, the argument suggests that our consciousness often prevents us from recognizing and acknowledging the unconscious, making it challenging to convince others of its existence and significance. Therefore, the answer is (D).",

In this case, it is that David teaches Chris. We can use the symbol \"T\" for \"teaches.\"\n\nSo, we can translate the sentence into predicate logic as:\n\nT(dc)\n\nThis means that the relation \"teaches\" holds between David and Chris. Now,let me explain you the option (A) Tdc ,(B) Tcd ,(C) Tcc and (D) dTc\n\n(A) Tdc : This is the correct translation as it means \"David teaches Chris\".\n\n(B) Tcd : This option is incorrect because it reverses the subject and object of the sentence, so it would mean \"Chris teaches David,\" which does not make sense in this context.\n\n(C) Tcc : This option is incorrect because it also reverses the subject and object of the sentence, so it would mean \"Chris teaches Chris,\" which is absurd.\n\n(D) dTc : This option is incorrect because it does not follow the usual syntax of predicate logic, where the subject is followed by the predicate and then the object. Instead, it places the object before the subject and predicate, which does not make sense in this context.
