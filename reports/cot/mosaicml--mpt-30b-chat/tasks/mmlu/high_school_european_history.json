The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\n(A) De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n(C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n(D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.",

He also gave them valuable items without expecting anything in return to gain their trust and persuade them to become Christians. Columbus's intention was to establish friendly relationships with the natives and to promote the interests of the Spanish government.\n\nOn the other hand, Source 2 is a book written by Bartholomew de las Casas in 1542, where he describes the cruelty and exploitation of the natives by the Spanish conquistadors. He argues that the primary motive of the Spanish was to acquire gold and riches, which led to the brutal treatment of the natives. He also points out that the Spanish mortality rate was high, and they needed more labor to work in the mines and plantations, which led to the importation of African slaves.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the two accounts can be attributed to Columbus's positive view of his interactions with the natives, while de las Casas's account reflects the negative impact of the Spanish colonization on the natives.
