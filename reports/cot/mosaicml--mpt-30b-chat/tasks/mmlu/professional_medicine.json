            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is:\n\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.\n\nThe patient's history of a pulmonary embolism and retroperitoneal hemorrhage, along with the subsequent placement of an IVC filter and anticoagulant therapy, increases the likelihood of peripheral nerve compression or injury due to the patient's compromised mobility and medical interventions. The patient's recent hematoma resolution also reduces the likelihood of this being a complication of the IVC filter placement or a cerebral infarction. The patient's normal vital signs and examination results further support the notion that the patient's symptoms are peripheral in nature.\n\nThe tingling and numbness described by the patient, along with the localized decreased sensation to light touch on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh, suggests a compression or injury of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. This nerve is responsible for sensory innervation of the anterior thigh and leg and can be compromised by external compression, such as from a hematoma, or internal compression, such as from a nerve root that has been injured or compressed by a herniated disc.<|im_end|>",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Based on the patient's history and examination, the most likely diagnosis is not Braxton Hicks contractions (A) because the patient is in active labor, has received medication for pain, and the contractions are not regular.\n\nStep 2: Lower uterine retraction ring (B) is a rare cause of delayed or prolonged labor and is characterized by a ring-like locus of tenderness and rigidity at the internal cervical os. However, the patient's examination shows that the cervix is 100% effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated, which is not consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nStep 3: Hypotonic uterine dysfunction (C) is a condition in which the uterine contractions are weak and not effective in progressing labor. The patient's intermittent, weak contractions are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nStep 4: Primary dysfunctional labor (D) is a condition in which the uterine contractions are weak and uncoordinated, resulting in slow or no progress in labor. The patient's intermittent, weak contractions and no progress in labor despite medication for pain suggest this diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is hypotonic uterine dysfunction (C).<|im_end|>",

The trial found that patients receiving the new drug had a shorter duration of symptoms compared to patients receiving a placebo. The physician needs to interpret the significance of these results.\n\nStep 2: Identify the key information\n* The study was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled.\n* The new drug resulted in a shorter duration of symptoms compared to the placebo (p=0.04).\n* The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the question stem\nThe question is asking for the most appropriate interpretation of the study results. The answer options provide different possibilities:\n\nA. The findings are clinically and statistically significant\nB. The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant\nC. The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant\nD. The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the answer options\nA. Clinically and statistically significant: The drug has both clinically relevant and statistically significant benefits.\nB. Clinically insignificant but statistically significant: The drug has little clinical benefit but there is a statistically significant difference between the drug and placebo.\nC. Clinically significant but statistically insignificant: The drug has clinically relevant benefits but the statistical difference between the drug and placebo is not significant.\nD. Neither clinically nor statistically significant: The drug has no clinically relevant benefits and the statistical difference between the drug and placebo is not significant.\n\nStep 5: Choose the best answer\nThe study found a statistically significant difference between the new drug and the placebo (p=0.04), which suggests that the new drug may have some clinical benefits. However, the magnitude of the benefit is not clear, as the difference in mean time for resolution of symptoms between the two groups was only 0.3 days (6.4 days vs 6.7 days). Therefore, the most appropriate interpretation of these study results is:\n\n(D) The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant<|im_end|>",

This can lead to lung congestion and fluid buildup in the lungs. The patient's cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces, which suggests a condition affecting the left side of the heart.

There is no information provided in the question to suggest that the patient is at risk for systemic hypertension.\n\nD) Tricuspid valve regurgitation: Tricuspid valve regurgitation is a condition in which the tricuspid valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow backward from the right atrium to the right ventricle. The patient's cardiac examination does not disclose any information about the function of the tricuspid valve. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the patient is at risk for tricuspid valve regurgitation based on the information provided in the question.\n\nTherefore, the patient is not at greatest risk for any of the complications listed in the question.<|im_end|>",
