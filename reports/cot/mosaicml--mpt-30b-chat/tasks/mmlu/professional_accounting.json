            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Calculate the daily income\nTo calculate the daily income, we need to know how many hours the car is hired on average per day. We are told that the car is hired for 2 hours a day on average. We also know that the rental rate is $245 per hour. Therefore, the daily income is:\n\nDaily income = (Number of hours hired per day) x (Hourly rate)\nDaily income = 2 x $245\nDaily income = $490\n\nStep 2: Calculate the yearly income\nSince the car is hired for 2 hours a day on average, and there are 24 hours in a day, the car is hired for 2/24 = 0.0833 or 8.33% of the day on average. Assuming the business operates every day of the year, including festivities and weekends, the total number of days in a year is 365. Therefore, the total number of hours the car is likely to be hired in a year is:\n\nTotal hours hired in a year = (Days in a year) x (Hours hired per day)\nTotal hours hired in a year = 365 x 0.0833\nTotal hours hired in a year = 29\n\nSince the car is hired for 2 hours a day on average, the car will be hired for 2 x 29 = 58 hours in a year. The yearly income is:\n\nYearly income = (Total hours hired in a year) x (Hourly rate)\nYearly income = 58 x $245\nYearly income = $14,170\n\nStep 3: Calculate the estimated yearly yield on investment\nTo calculate the estimated yearly yield on investment, we need to subtract the daily costs from the daily income. We are told that the daily costs are about $50. Therefore, the estimated yearly yield on investment is:\n\nEstimated yearly yield = (Daily income) - (Daily costs) x (Days in a year)\nEstimated yearly yield = $490 - $50 x 365\nEstimated yearly yield = $16,600 - $18,250\nEstimated yearly yield = -$1,550\n\nThe answer cannot be (A) 164% since that would imply a positive estimated yearly yield, which contradicts the fact that the estimated yearly yield is -$1,550. Therefore, the answer cannot be (A).\n\nStep 4: Output the answer\nThe estimated yearly yield on investment is negative, which means that the business is not profitable. Therefore, the answer must be (D) 183%.<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is correct about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer, we need to understand the concept of audit sampling and the different types of risks involved in the audit process.\n\nAudit sampling is a technique used by auditors to examine a representative subset of transactions or accounts rather than the entire population. The purpose of audit sampling is to reduce the auditing effort and to increase the efficiency of the audit process while still providing reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nThere are two types of risks associated with audit sampling: sampling risk and nonsampling risk.\n\nSampling risk is the risk that the sample selected for examination may not be representative of the population as a whole. This means that the results of the audit may not be generalizable to the entire population, and the auditor may miss some misstatements that exist in the population but not in the sample.\n\nNonsampling risk, on the other hand, is the risk that the sample selected for examination may be representative of the population but the auditor fails to detect misstatements that exist in the sample. This can happen if the audit procedures applied to the sample are not appropriate or if the auditor fails to recognize misstatements that are present in the sample.\n\nNow, let's analyze each of the given statements:\n\n(A) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\nThis statement is correct. Nonsampling risk refers to the possibility that the results of the audit based on a sample may not be representative of the entire population. When the auditor performs a substantive test on a sample, the conclusions may be different if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\n(B) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\n\nThis statement is partially correct. Nonsampling risk can arise because of the auditor's failure to recognize misstatements, but this is only one of the factors that can contribute to nonsampling risk. Other factors include the possibility that the sample may not be representative of the population, or that the audit procedures applied to the sample may not be appropriate.\n\n(C) Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Sampling risk is the risk that the sample selected for examination may not be representative of the population as a whole. It is the risk that the conclusions drawn from the sample may not be generalizable to the entire population.\n\n(D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Sampling risk does not include the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. Sampling risk refers to the risk<|im_end|>",

            "question": "Which of the following procedures would an auditor generally perform regarding subsequent events?\n\n(A) Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end.\n(B) Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate.\n(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\n(D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the concept of subsequent events\n\nAn auditor's main goal is to provide an opinion on whether the financial statements present a true and fair view of the entity's financial position and performance. This includes ensuring that all events that have occurred up to the balance sheet date or year end are properly accounted for. However, not all events are within the auditor's scope.\n\nSubsequent events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date or year-end but before the financial statements are issued. The auditor's standard report includes an opinion on whether the financial statements include all events that should be recognized up to the balance sheet date or year-end. However, the auditor does not provide an opinion on subsequent events.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the options provided\n\nThe options provided are as follows:\n\n(A) Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end.\n\nThis option involves inspecting inventory items that were ordered before the year-end but arrived after the year-end. Since the auditor's scope ends at the balance sheet date or year-end, this procedure is not related to subsequent events.\n\n(B) Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate.\n\nThis option involves testing internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate. This procedure is related to the entity's internal control and not to subsequent events.\n\n(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\n\nThis option involves reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year-end. Since bank statements after the year-end are subsequent events, this procedure is related to subsequent events to the extent that it covers events after the year-end.\n\n(D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.\n\nThis option involves comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited. Interim financial statements are financial statements that are issued by the entity for a period between two annual financial periods. Comparing interim financial statements with the statements being audited may help identify events that occurred before the balance sheet date or year-end that were not properly accounted for. However, this option does not explicitly relate to subsequent events.\n\nStep 3: Determine the answer\n\nOnly option (C) is explicitly related to subsequent events. Therefore, the answer is (C).<|im_end|>",

This means that the company recorded more premium than what was actually required, resulting in an overstatement of the retained earnings.\n\nAt June 30 year 12, the bond will have one year remaining until maturity. Since the error was made over the life of the bond, the overstatement of the premium will also be overstated for one year.

To calculate YTM, we can use the following formula:\n\nYTM = (Coupon rate / (1 + Coupon rate)) ^ 2 - (1 / (1 + Coupon rate))\n\nwhere,\nCoupon rate = 5% = 0.05\n\nYTM = (0.05 / (1 + 0.05)) ^ 2 - (1 / (1 + 0.05))\nYTM = (0.05 / 1.05) ^ 2 - 0.95\nYTM \u2248 4.76%\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Coupon Payment\nThe coupon payment can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nCoupon Payment = Coupon rate * Face value\nCoupon Payment = 0.05 * $100\nCoupon Payment = $5\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Price of the Bond\nThe price of the bond is equal to the sum of the present value of the coupon payments and the present value of the face value discounted at the YTM.\n\nPrice of the Bond = Coupon Payment + (Face value / (1 + YTM))\n\nPrice of the Bond = $5 + ($100 / (1 + 0.0476))\nPrice of the Bond = $5 + ($100 / 1.0476)\nPrice of the Bond \u2248 $97.33\n\nSo, the price of the three-year bond with a face value of $100, paying 5% coupons, and a yield of 6% is approximately $97.33.

The company expects to complete the sale in four months. We need to determine which of the given statements regarding the old building are correct.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the options\n\n(A) It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale.\nThis statement is correct. When a company decides to sell a property, it will reclassify the property as an asset held for sale. This classification indicates that the company intends to sell the asset relatively quickly.\n\n(B) It will be classified as a current asset.\nThis statement is not correct. When the old building is reclassified as an asset held for sale, it will no longer be classified as a current asset. Current assets are those that can be converted to cash within one year or one operating cycle, whichever is longer.
