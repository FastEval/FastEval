            "model_answer": "To determine the correct statement about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer, we need to understand the concepts of sampling and nonsampling risk.\n\nAudit sampling is a technique used by auditors to examine a representative selection of transactions or accounts, rather than examining all of them. The purpose of audit sampling is to reduce the amount of audit work required, while still providing reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nSampling risk is the risk that the sample selected by the auditor may not be representative of the population as a whole. This means that the conclusions drawn from the sample may not be accurate or reliable, and the auditor may miss some misstatements that occur in the population.\n\nNonsampling risk is the risk of errors or mistakes that occur during the audit process, but are not related to the sampling process. Nonsampling risk can arise from various sources, such as the auditor's failure to recognize misstatements, errors in the audit program, or changes in the financial statements that occur after the date of the audit.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n(A) The first statement suggests that nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population. This statement partially explains nonsampling risk, but it also mentions substantive testing, which is not directly related to sampling. Therefore, this statement is not entirely correct.\n\n(B) The second statement suggests that nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements. This statement is partially correct, as nonsampling risk can indeed arise from the auditor's failure to detect misstatements. However, this statement does not specifically mention the sampling process, so it is not entirely accurate.\n\n(C) The third statement suggests that sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. This statement is partially correct, as sampling risk does indeed arise from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to a sample of transactions or accounts. However, this statement does not mention nonsampling risk, so it is not entirely accurate.\n\n(D) The fourth statement suggests that sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. This statement is partially correct, as sampling risk can indeed arise from selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. However, this statement does not mention nonsampling risk, so it is not entirely accurate.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the correct statement about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer is statement (B): \"Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\"",

However, this option does not specifically refer to subsequent events, so it is not the correct answer.\n\n(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end - This procedure is related to subsequent events because it involves reviewing events that occurred after the balance sheet date. An auditor would look for any evidence of events that should be recognized in the financial statements, such as deposits or payments that have not been recorded.\n\n(D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited - This procedure is not related to subsequent events because it involves comparing interim financial statements with the final financial statements being audited.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C).",

So, for each period, the interest expense will be higher than the effective interest rate, resulting in an overstatement of interest expense.\n\nThe effective interest method, on the other hand, considers the time value of money and amortizes the premium based on the effective interest rate. As a result, the interest expense will be more accurate, and the bond carrying amount will be lower than the present value of the expected payments.\n\nSince Dean Co. incorrectly used the straight-line method, the interest expense and bond carrying amount will be overstated.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the bond's price given its yield, coupon rate, and face value. We can use the bond pricing formula to do this. However, the formula requires us to use the bond's yield-to-maturity, not its coupon rate. To find the yield-to-maturity, we need to make some assumptions about interest rates and the bond's redemption value.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. We assume that interest rates remain constant over the bond's life.\n2. We assume that the bond pays no taxes.\n3. We assume that there is no default risk (i.e., the bond pays all its coupons and face value at maturity).\n\nNow, we can use the bond pricing formula:\n\nPV = CMT + (FACE VALUE / (1 + YTM))\n\nwhere PV is the bond's present value, CMT is the coupon payments discount factor, FACE VALUE is the bond's face value, and YTM is the bond's yield-to-maturity.\n\nWe need to find the bond's YTM first. We can rearrange the formula for YTM:\n\nYTM = (CMT - (FACE VALUE / PV)) * (2 * N) / (FACE VALUE + (PV - CMT))\n\nwhere N is the number of periods in the bond's life, and we assume N = 3 for a three-year bond. We also need the bond's coupon payment, which is 5% of its face value, or $5 per period.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the YTM formula:\n\nYTM = (1 - (100 / (CMT + 100))) * (2 * 3) / (100 + (CMT + 100 - CMT))\nYTM = (1 - 5/105) * 6 / 105\nYTM = 0.09524 * 6 / 105\nYTM \u2248 0.06 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow that we have the bond's YTM, we can plug it back into the bond pricing formula to find the bond's price:\n\nPV = CMT + (100 / (1 + 0.06))\n\nTo find CMT, we need to calculate the present value of the coupon payments using the formula:\n\nPV_coupons = (COUPN * N) / ((1 + YTM)^N - 1)\n\nPV_coupons = (5 * 3) / (1.06^3 - 1)\nPV_coupons \u2248 78.05\n\nNow, we can subtract the present value of the coupons from the bond's face value to find the clean price:\n\nCMT = 100 - 78.05\nCMT \u2248 21.95\n\nFinally, we can plug the value of CMT back into the bond pricing formula:\n\nPV = 21.95 + (100 / (1 + 0.06))\nPV \u2248 97.88\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) $97.33.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct statement, we need to understand the accounting treatment of a building when it is classified as held for sale.\n\nWhen a company decides to sell a building, it will reclassify the building from its property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) account to a separate asset account called \"asset held for sale\". This reclassification occurs because the company is no longer using the building for its operations and intends to sell it.\n\nSince the old building is being actively marketed for sale, and the company expects to complete the sale in four months, statement (A) is correct. The old building will be reclassified as an asset held for sale.\n\nNow let's analyze the other statements:\n\n(B) The old building will not be classified as a current asset. Current assets are those that are expected to be converted into cash within one year or less. Since the company is not expecting to convert the old building into cash within one year, it will not be classified as a current asset.\n\n(C) The old building will no longer be depreciated. When a building is classified as held for sale, the company will stop depreciating it. This is because the building's value will be adjusted to its fair value, which is the expected selling price, and depreciation is no longer necessary.\n\n(D) The old building will still be valued at historical cost. However, the carrying amount of the building will be adjusted to its fair value, which is the expected selling price. The fair value will be reported as a liability in the company's balance sheet, and the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value will be recorded as a gain or loss.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct statement is (A): It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale.",
