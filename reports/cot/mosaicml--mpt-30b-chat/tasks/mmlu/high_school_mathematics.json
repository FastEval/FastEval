To reflect the pentagon across this line, we will need to find the reflection of each vertex across the line.\n\nLet's consider a vertex of the pentagon, (x1, y1). To reflect this point across the line y = x, we need to find the point (x2, y2) such that y2 = 1(x2 - x1).\n\nLet's plug in the coordinates of one of the vertices of P, such as (\u20132, \u20134), into this equation.\n\ny2 = 1(x2 - (-2))\n\ny2 = 1(x2 + 2)\n\nNow we can substitute y1 = 1x into the equation to find x2.\n\ny2 = x2 + 2\n\ny2 - 2 = x2\n\nx2 = y2 - 2\n\nFor the vertex (\u20132, \u20134), we can find x2 as follows:\n\ny2 - 2 = x2\n\n1(x2 + 2) - 2 = x2\n\nx2 = 1(x2 + 2) - 2\n\nx2 = x2 + 2 - 2\n\nx2 = x2\n\nSince x2 is equal to itself, we have a contradiction.
