            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to first find the equation of the line y = x. This line is a diagonal of the pentagon, and it goes through two vertices of the pentagon. Let's call these vertices A and B.\n\nThe coordinates of vertex A are (\u20132, \u20134) and the coordinates of vertex B are (3, 0). We can use the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line to find the equation of the line y = x. The slope of this line is 1, so the equation of the line is y = x + b, where b is the y-intercept.\n\nWe know that the line goes through vertex A, so we can write the coordinates of vertex A in terms of the line:\n\n(-2, \u20134) = (x + b, x)\n\nPlugging in the coordinates of vertex A, we get:\n\n(-2, \u20134) = (1 + b, -1)\n\nNow, we can solve for b:\n\nb = -4\n\nSo, the equation of the line y = x is y = x - 4.\n\nNow, we need to find the coordinates of the reflected vertex. Since the line y = x is the mirror line, the x-coordinate of the reflected vertex will be the same as the x-coordinate of the original vertex, and the y-coordinate will be the negative of the x-coordinate.\n\nLet's call the reflected vertex C. The coordinates of vertex C are (x, \u2013x). Since vertex A has coordinates (-2, -4), the coordinates of vertex C are:\n\nC = (-2, -x)\n\nWe still need to find the value of x. One way to do this is to use geometry to find the measure of one of the angles of the pentagon and use the fact that the sum of the angles in a pentagon is (5 \\* 180) / 3 = 750.\n\nHowever, there's an easier way to find the value of x. We can notice that the line y = x divides the pentagon into two congruent isosceles triangles. One of these triangles has vertices A, B, and the reflected vertex C, and the other has vertices B, C, and the fifth vertex of the pentagon (which we'll call D).\n\nTriangle ABD has angles ABD = 750 - 528 = 222 and ABC = 180. Since the triangle is isosceles with vertices A and B, the angle BDC is also 180. Therefore, triangle ABD is an isosceles triangle with vertices A, B, and D, where AD = DB.\n\nWe can use the distance formula to find the length of AD. AD is the perpendicular distance from vertex A to the line y = x, and the distance from vertex B to vertex C is x - (-1):\n\nAD^2 = (x - (-1))^2 + 1^2\n\nSince AD = DB, we can also write DB^2 = (x - (-1))^2 + 1^2, and we know that DB = AC. We can use this information to find the coordinates of vertex D:\n\nD = (4 - 2 * sqrt(2), -2)\n\nNow we can find the value of x by plugging the coordinates of D into the equation of the line y = x:\n\nD = (-4, -2)\n\nHowever, since D is not on the line y = x, this answer is not correct. Therefore, we need to reconsider our approach.\n\nInstead of reflecting the pentagon across the line y = x, we can rotate it 72 degrees counterclockwise around the point (-1, 1). This will take the point (-2, -4) to the point (4, 1). Therefore, the answer is (B) (4, 1).",

            "model_answer": "To find the answer, we need to analyze the given information and the definition of a strictly convex function. Let's start by plotting the given points $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$ on a graph.\n\nPlotting the points, we find that the function $f(x)$ lies below the line segment connecting $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$ for all values of $x$ between $-2$ and $2$. This tells us that the function is indeed strictly convex in this interval.\n\nNow, let's find the range of possible values for $f(1)$. Since the function is strictly convex, the portion of the graph between $x=-2$ and $x=2$ lies below the line segment between $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$. Therefore, when $x=1$, the value of $f(1)$ must also lie below this line segment.\n\nThe line segment between $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$ can be represented by the equation $y = (9/2)x + (5/2)$, since the slope of the line is $m = (9-5)/(2-(-2)) = 4/4 = 1$.\n\nWe want to find the minimum value of $f(1)$ that satisfies the condition $f(1) < y = (9/2)x + (5/2)$ for all $x$ between $-2$ and $2$. To do this, we can find the value of $f(1)$ that corresponds to the lowest point on the graph of $y = f(x)$ that is still below this line segment.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is strictly convex, the lowest point on the graph of $y = f(x)$ between $x=-2$ and $x=2$ is the lowest point on the entire graph of $f(x)$. This lowest point must be either a minimum or a point where the derivative of $f(x)$ is undefined (i.e., an asymptote).\n\nSince the function passes through $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$, it must have a minimum value between these two points. Let's call this minimum value $f(m)$, where $m$ is some value between $-2$ and $2$. Then, we know that $f(m)$ lies on the line segment between $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$, so we can write:\n\n$f(m) = (9/2)m + (5/2)$\n\nNow we need to find the minimum value of $f(1)$ that satisfies $f(1) < f(m)$ for all possible values of $m$ between $-2$ and $2$. We can do this by finding the minimum value of $f(1)$ that satisfies:\n\n$f(1) < (9/2)m + (5/2)$ for all $m$ between $-2$ and $2$\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get:\n\n$f(1) < 9m/2 + 5/2$\n\nSince $m$ can take on any value between $-2$ and $2$, we cannot determine a specific value for $f(1)$ that satisfies this inequality. However, we can express the range of possible values for $f(1)$ using interval notation.\n\nSince $f(1)$ must lie below the line segment between $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$, we know that $f(1)$ must be greater than or equal to $5$ and less than or equal to $9$. Therefore, the range of all possible values for $f(1)$ is:\n\n$[5, 9]$\n\nSo, the answer is (C) $(-inf, 8)$.",
