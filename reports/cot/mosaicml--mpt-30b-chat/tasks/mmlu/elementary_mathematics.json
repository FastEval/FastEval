Since she drove the same number of miles each day, we can assume that the total number of miles she drove each day was 40/5 = 8 miles.\n\nStep 2:\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This gives us 40/5 = 8/2 = 4.\n\nStep 3:\nSince Ms. Perez drove the same number of miles each day, and she drove 4 miles each day for 5 days, we can conclude that she drove a total of 4 x 5 = 20 miles.\n\nStep 4:\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 8.",
