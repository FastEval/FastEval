Since 1 is the GCF, we can write 1 as a mixed number with a whole part of 1 and a fractional part of 1/1.\n\nNext, we need to find the equivalent mixed number representation of 11/1. To do this, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator of 11/1 by the GCF of 1, which is still 1. This gives us 11/1 times 1/1, which simplifies to 11/1.\n\nNow, we want to convert this mixed number to its simplest form. We can do this by dividing both the whole part and the fractional part by their greatest common factor. In this case, the whole part is 11, which we can divide by 1 to get 1 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, the simplified whole part is 1.\n\nThe fractional part is already in its simplest form, since there is no common factor between 11 and 1 other than 1 itself.
