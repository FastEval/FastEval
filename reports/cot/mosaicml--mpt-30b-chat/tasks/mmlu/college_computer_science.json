It is called \"floating\" because the digits \"float\" between integer and fractional parts.\n\n(A) Inherently nonassociative because some numbers have no exact representation: This is true because not all real numbers can be represented exactly in binary floating-point format. This is due to the limited number of bits used to represent the number and the need to reserve some bits for the exponent. This leads to some numbers having approximations that are not precisely equal to themselves when multiplied or added to other numbers.\n\n(B) Inherently nonassociative because there have to be upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers: This is false. While it is true that there are upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers in floating-point arithmetic, this does not necessarily make the arithmetic nonassociative. Associativity is a property of the arithmetic operations themselves, not the size of the numbers being operated on.\n\n(C) Associativity can be achieved with appropriate roundoff conventions: This is true. In floating-point arithmetic, the IEEE 754 standard specifies conventions for rounding that allow for associative operations. This means that the order in which operations are performed does not affect the result, as long as the same rounding conventions are used for all operations.\n\n(D) Some rational numbers have no exact representation: This is true.
