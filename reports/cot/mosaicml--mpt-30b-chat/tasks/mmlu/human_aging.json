            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the available evidence on risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, leading to cognitive decline and dementia.\n\nThere are several known risk factors for Alzheimer's, including age, family history, genetics, and lifestyle factors. In terms of ethnicity, research has shown that Alzheimer's is more common in non-Hispanic whites than in other ethnic groups, including African Americans and Hispanic Americans. However, this does not necessarily mean that being African or Hispanic American is protective against Alzheimer's, as other factors may be at play.\n\nEating fish, particularly fatty fish like salmon, has been shown to have potential benefits for brain health, as fish contain omega-3 fatty acids that have anti-inflammatory effects and may help to maintain brain function. However, the evidence for a protective effect of fish consumption on Alzheimer's risk is not yet conclusive.\n\nEducation has been shown to be inversely associated with Alzheimer's risk, with higher levels of education being protective. This may be due to a combination of factors, including greater cognitive reserve, healthier lifestyle behaviors, and increased social engagement.\n\nMarriage has also been shown to be associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's, although the exact mechanism is not clear. One theory is that married individuals have more social support and better access to healthcare, which may help to protect against cognitive decline.\n\nBased on this evidence, the answer to the question is most likely (D) being married.",

            "question": "Normal memory seems to be improved by\n\n(A) Aerobic exercise\n(B) Taking acetylcholine\n(C) Taking gingko\n(D) Increasing social contacts",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Improving Normal Memory with Aerobic Exercise\n\nAerobic exercise consists of activities that increase your heart rate and oxygen consumption, such as running, cycling, or swimming. Research has shown that regular aerobic exercise can improve memory and cognitive function in both young and older adults. This is because exercise increases blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain, which can enhance the growth of new neurons and improve connectivity between existing neurons. Additionally, exercise has been shown to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain, which can contribute to cognitive decline.\n\nStep 2: Acetylcholine and Memory\n\nAcetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in memory and learning. It is involved in the transmission of signals between neurons in the brain and is particularly important for forming new memories. However, acetylcholine levels naturally decline with age, which can contribute to age-related cognitive decline. Taking acetylcholine supplements may temporarily improve memory by boosting the availability of this neurotransmitter in the brain.\n\nStep 3: Gingko Biloba and Memory\n\nGingko biloba is a herb that has been used traditionally in Chinese medicine to improve memory and cognitive function. There is some scientific evidence to support its use for this purpose. Gingko biloba contains flavonoids that can improve blood flow to the brain and protect neurons from damage. It may also have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that can help maintain brain health. However, the evidence for its effectiveness is mixed, and more research is needed to determine its long-term effects on memory.\n\nStep 4: Increasing Social Contacts and Memory\n\nSocial interaction and engagement are essential for maintaining cognitive function and memory as we age. Research has shown that individuals with more robust social networks and greater social engagement tend to have better cognitive function and slower rates of cognitive decline. This is because social interaction stimulates the brain and provides opportunities for learning and problem-solving. Additionally, social support has been shown to reduce stress and promote better sleep, both of which can contribute to improved memory and cognitive function.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference: (For further reading)\n\n1.

Mechanistic approaches emphasize the study of parts and their interactions, while organismic approaches emphasize the study of whole organisms and their emergent properties.\n\nContinuity vs. discontinuity refers to a debate in developmental psychology about the nature of development over the life span. Continuity theorists argue that development is a continuous process, while discontinuity theorists argue that development consists of distinct stages or periods of change.\n\nThe answer \"both play an important role\" is applicable to all four questions because in each case, there is a debate or disagreement about the relative importance of different perspectives or factors. In the nature vs. nurture debate, both inherited and learned factors are thought to play important roles in shaping behavior and abilities. In the mechanistic vs. organismic debate, both reductionist and holistic approaches have their strengths and limitations.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understanding the lens of the eye\nThe lens of the eye is a transparent, biconvex structure located behind the iris and in front of the vitreous humor. Its primary function is to focus light onto the retina, which then sends signals to the brain to create an image.\n\nStep 2: Age-related changes\nAs we age, our body undergoes several changes, and the eyes are no exception. The lens of the eye can experience several age-related changes, including:\n\n* Thickening: The lens becomes thicker with age, which can lead to a condition called presbyopia. This makes it difficult to focus on nearby objects and is a common reason for reading glasses.\n* Yellowing: The lens can become more yellow with age, but this is not a common term used in medicine. Instead, it is referred to as cortical cataracts or subcapsular cataracts.\n* Clouding: The lens can become cloudy with age due to the accumulation of protein deposits, which is known as a cataract. Cataracts are a common age-related change and can impair vision.\n* Fluid accumulation: The lens can fill with fluid due to a blockage in the drainage system, leading to a condition called secondary angle-closure glaucoma. This can cause increased intraocular pressure, which can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss.\n\nStep 3: Identifying the answer\nNow that we understand the age-related changes that can occur in the lens of the eye, we can identify which one does NOT usually occur as we grow older. \n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n(C) It does NOT become clouded.\n\nClouding of the lens (cataracts) is a common age-related change that occurs in most people over the age of 65. The other options, thickening and fluid accumulation, are also age-related changes that can occur in the lens. Therefore, the only option that does NOT usually occur as we grow older is clouding of the lens.",
