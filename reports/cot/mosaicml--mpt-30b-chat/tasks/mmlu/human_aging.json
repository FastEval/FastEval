            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we need to examine the docility hypothesis and understand the meaning of the terms \"capability\" and \"docile.\"\n\nThe docility hypothesis is a theory that attempts to explain how individuals react to environmental demands. The hypothesis suggests that individuals facing high environmental demands will respond in a particular way. However, the hypothesis does not clearly state whether those with low capabilities are more vulnerable to environmental demands or whether those with less capability are less vulnerable to environmental demands.\n\nTherefore, we can eliminate choice (D) because it contradicts the information given in the docility hypothesis.\n\nNow, let's examine the remaining options:\n\nChoice (A): This option suggests that those with low capabilities are more vulnerable to environmental demands. While it is possible that individuals with low capabilities may be more vulnerable to environmental demands, the docility hypothesis does not explicitly state this.\n\nChoice (B): This option suggests that those who experience high environmental demands become more docile. Docile means obedient or submissive, so this option suggests that individuals facing high environmental demands will become more obedient or submissive as a response. However, the docility hypothesis does not explicitly state this.\n\nChoice (C): This option suggests that those who experience high environmental demands become less docile. This contradicts the definition of docile, which means obedient or submissive. Therefore, this option cannot be correct.\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct answer is (A) because it is the only option that does not contradict the information given in the docility hypothesis.<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "There are several factors that can improve normal memory, and each of the options you have provided could potentially play a role.\n\n(A) Aerobic exercise has been shown to improve memory and cognitive function in several ways. Exercise increases blood flow to the brain, which can enhance the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to brain cells. Additionally, exercise has been shown to promote the growth of new brain cells and improve the connections between existing cells.\n\n(B) Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in memory and learning. When acetylcholine levels are low, memory and cognitive function can be impaired. Taking acetylcholine supplements may help to improve memory by increasing the availability of this neurotransmitter in the brain.\n\n(C) Ginkgo biloba is a herbal supplement that has been shown to improve memory and cognitive function in some people. Ginkgo biloba works by increasing blood flow to the brain and improving the function of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine.\n\n(D) Increasing social contacts can also improve memory and cognitive function. Social interaction and engaging in mentally stimulating activities can help to maintain and improve brain function as we age.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that all of the options you have provided could potentially improve normal memory. However, further research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness of each of these approaches.<|im_end|>",

This perspective recognizes that development is not isolated or independent of these factors, but instead is influenced by them.

Development is a complex and dynamic process that is influenced by various factors, including history, culture, and social context.\n2. The perspective that development is embedded in history means that development is not just a biological process, but is also influenced by past events and historical processes.\n3. Therefore, understanding development requires consideration of these historical and cultural factors, as they can have a significant impact on an individual's development.\n4. This perspective emphasizes the importance of considering sociocultural conditions, as they can shape an individual's development in various ways.\n5.

Here is a brief explanation of each:\n\n(A) Nature vs. nurture: This is the dichotomy between the genetic or innate factors that determine human behavior and development versus the environmental or cultural factors that shape behavior and development.\n\n(B) Mechanistic vs organismic: This dichotomy pertains to two different perspectives in psychology\u2014the mechanistic perspective, which focuses on the parts or components of a system and how they interact, and the organismic perspective, which focuses on the whole system and its organization and homeostasis.\n\n(C) Continuity vs. discontinuity: This dichotomy refers to two different approaches to understanding human development\u2014the continuity approach, which assumes that development is a gradual, continuous process, and the discontinuity approach, which assumes that development involves abrupt, qualitative changes.\n\nNow, let's consider each choice and determine why the answer \"both play an important role\" might be applicable:\n\n(A) Nature vs. nurture: The answer \"both play an important role\" would be applicable here because it acknowledges that both genetic and environmental factors can influence human behavior and development. This is a key point in the nature vs. nurture debate, as proponents of either side tend to overstate the importance of their preferred factor.\n\n(B) Mechanistic vs organismic: The answer \"both play an important role\" would not be particularly applicable here, as the mechanical vs. organismic dichotomy is not generally about the relative importance of parts versus wholes, but rather about different perspectives on how to study wholes.\n\n(C) Continuity vs. discontinuity: The answer \"both play an important role\" would be applicable here because it acknowledges that human development is a complex process that involves both gradual, continuous changes and also perhaps more abrupt, qualitative changes.\n\nGiven that the answer \"both play an important role\" is applicable to choice (A), the final answer is:\n\n(A) Nature vs. nurture<|im_end|>",

However, this change does not directly affect the lens's function.\n\nC) It becomes clouded: This is the same as cataracts, which we have already discussed.\n\nD) It fills with fluid: This can occur due to a condition called pseudoexfoliation syndrome, where a protein called amyloid accumulates in the lens and causes it to become cloudy.

This means we need to understand what programmed and unprogrammed theories are, and what senescence means.\n\nStep 2: Defining terms\nProgrammed theories of senescence propose that aging is a predetermined process programmed into an organism's DNA. Unprogrammed theories, on the other hand, attribute senescence to environmental factors such as stress and damage. Senescence refers to the process of aging and the decline of an organism's functionality over time.\n\nStep 3: Analyzing the answer choices\nNow that we understand the terms, let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) Attribute senescence only to environmental factors - This is incorrect because programmed theories also attribute senescence to genetic factors.\n(B) Are far too difficulty to test - This is incorrect because there is no general statement that can be made about the difficulty of testing programmed or unprogrammed theories.\n(C) Claim that senescence follows a predetermined plan - This is partially correct. Programmed theories propose that senescence follows a predetermined plan, but unprogrammed theories do not.\n(D) Rely too heavily on computer models - This is incorrect because the use of computer models is not specific to either programmed or unprogrammed theories.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nThe correct answer is (C) Claim that senescence follows a predetermined plan.<|im_end|>",
