            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Murtis can be translated as \"(A) Offerings\".\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Murtis is a Sanskrit word that refers to a physical representation of a deity in Hinduism.\n2. It usually refers to a statue or image of a god or goddess that is worshipped in a temple or home.\n3. The word \"murti\" comes from the root \"mrtyu\", which means \"to die\" or \"to pass away\". In Hinduism, the purpose of worshipping a murti is to connect with the deity and to receive their blessings, rather than to worship the physical form itself.\n4. Therefore, murtis can be translated as \"offerings\" because they are physical objects offered to the deity as a form of respect and worship.\n5. Option (A) is therefore the correct answer.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer the question, we need to identify the naturalists who focused on natural elements and processes in Chinese philosophy. Let's explore each option provided:\n\n(A) Daoism: Daoism is a Chinese philosophy that emphasizes living in harmony with the Dao (\u9053), or the way of nature. Daoists seek to understand the natural world and live in accordance with its principles. However, Daoism is a broader philosophy that also includes spiritual and spiritual practices, such as the search for immortality and the attainment ofjen (\u4eba), or humaneness. Daoist naturalism is not limited to natural elements and processes alone, so we can eliminate option (A).\n\n(B) Yin-Yang School: The Yin-Yang School is an ancient Chinese philosophy that sees the universe as a balance of opposing forces, yin and yang. Yin represents the feminine, passive, and dark aspects of the universe, while yang represents the masculine, active, and bright aspects. This philosophy is concerned with understanding the natural world and its processes, but it is not limited to natural elements and processes. Therefore, option (B) can be eliminated as well.\n\n(C) Mengzi: Mengzi, also known as Mencius, was a Chinese philosopher who lived in the 4th century BCE. He advocated for humanistic values, such as ren (\u4ec1), or benevolence, andli (\u79ae), or ritual propriety. While Mengzi's philosophy includes discussions of nature and the relationship between humans and the natural world, it is not primarily focused on natural elements and processes. Thus, option (C) can be eliminated.\n\n(D) Humanistic Buddhism: Humanistic Buddhism, also known as Humanistic Buddhism or Engaged Buddhism, is a form of Buddhism that emphasizes the practical application of Buddhist principles in daily life. This form of Buddhism emerged in 20th century China and is focused on promoting human welfare and contributing to society. Humanistic Buddhism incorporates elements of naturalism, as it emphasizes understanding and living in accordance with natural laws and processes, including the interconnectedness of all beings. Therefore, humanistic Buddhism is associated with naturalists who focused on natural elements and processes. The answer is (D).",

            "model_answer": "The first Buddhist temple in Japan was not constructed until the year 628 CE, which corresponds to the answer choice (D).\n\nHere is the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Buddhism was first introduced to Japan in the year 538 CE, when a Chinese Buddhist priest named Bodhidharma traveled to the kingdom of Kibi in present-day Japan.\n2. However, it was not until several decades later, in the year 603 CE, that the Japanese Emperor Yomei officially declared Buddhism to be the state religion.\n3. This led to the construction of several Buddhist temples and monasteries across Japan, including the famous Hoss\u014dji temple in Nara, which is often considered to be the first Buddhist temple in Japan.\n4. The construction of Hoss\u014dji temple is believed to have taken place in the year 628 CE, which corresponds to the answer choice (D).\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 596 CE.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The Sikh tradition was founded by Guru Nanak in the 15th century in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent. The Sikh religion emphasizes the importance of spirituality, selfless service, and equality for all human beings. One of the ways in which the Sikh Gurus promoted these values was through the use of music and poetry, known as Kirtan.\n\nKirtan is a form of devotional music that is central to Sikh worship. It involves the recitation of hymns from the Sikh scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib, accompanied by musical instruments such as the harmonium, tabla, and dhol. The Sikh Gurus recognized the power of music to evoke emotional and spiritual responses in people, and they used it as a tool for promoting devotion and spiritual growth.\n\nIn order to enhance the spiritual experience of Kirtan, the Sikh Gurus instructed the use of particular Ragas, which are melodic structures used in Indian classical music. Each Raga has its own unique characteristics, such as mood, tempo, and musical scale, which can evoke different emotional and spiritual responses in the listener. By using specific Ragas in Kirtan, the Sikh Gurus sought to create a sense of harmony and balance, as well as to promote spiritual devotion and piety.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (A) harmony and balance.",
