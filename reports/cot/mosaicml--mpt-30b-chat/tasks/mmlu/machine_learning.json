It estimates the parameters of a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The statement says that among all unbiased estimators, the linear regression estimator has the smallest variance. Variance is a measure of the spread of the estimated values around the true value. A smaller variance means that the estimated values are more concentrated around the true value. This statement is generally true.\n\nStatement 2: AdaBoost is a machine learning algorithm that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers are used to determine the weight of each classifier in the final decision. The statement says that the coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative. This statement is generally true.\n\nStep 2: Based on the analysis of each statement, we can conclude that both statements are generally true.\n\nAnswer: (A) True, True<|im_end|>",

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a popular language model that was released in 2018. RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach) is another language model that was released in 2019 and is based on the BERT architecture. RoBERTa is pretrained on a corpus that is significantly larger than the one BERT was pretrained on. Specifically, RoBERTa is pretrained on a corpus that is approximately 160GB in size, while BERT was pretrained on around 3.3GB of data.

Like logistic regression, SVMs can give a probability distribution over the possible labels given an input example. This is because SVMs can be softened using a technique called Platt scaling or logistic function, which converts the output of the SVM into a probability distribution over the classes.\n\nStatement 2: Support vectors are the data points that are closest to the decision boundary in an SVM model. They play a crucial role in determining the performance of the SVM model. In general, we would expect the support vectors to remain relatively stable as we change the kernel function used in the SVM. This is because the support vectors are determined based on the geometry of the dataset and the decision boundary, rather than the specific form of the kernel function.\n\nHowever, the number and specific identity of the support vectors may change as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels. This is because the polynomial kernels can create nonlinear decision boundaries, which may require different data points to be closest to the boundary.\n\nTherefore, the statement is generally true, but there may be some exceptions where the support vectors change significantly as we move to higher order polynomial kernels.\n\nAnswer: (D) False, True<|im_end|>",

The expectation maximation (EM) algorithm is an iterative method used to find the parameters of a statistical model that maximizes the probability of the observed data. In each iteration, the EM algorithm calculates the expected complete data log-likelihood given the current parameters, and then maximizes this expected log-likelihood to update the parameters. This process is repeated until convergence, where the log-likelihood no longer increases.\n\nStatement 2: One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment.\n\nThis statement is true. Q-learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that learns to make optimal decisions in an uncertain environment by maximizing the expected reward. The key assumption of Q-learning is that the learner knows the transition probabilities and reward functions of the environment, which means that the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect the environment.
