            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nStatement 1: Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators. This statement is true. In statistics, the variance is a measure of how spread out a set of numbers is. The smaller the variance, the more concentrated the numbers are around their average. Linear regression is a statistical method used to establish a relationship between two variables. It involves finding the line of best fit for a set of data points. The estimator in linear regression is the slope of the line, and it is an unbiased estimator. This means that the estimated value of the slope is equal to the true value of the slope. The variance of the estimator is the smallest among all unbiased estimators, which makes linear regression a widely used method.\n\nStatement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative. This statement is true. AdaBoost is a machine learning algorithm used for classification problems. It works by combining multiple weak classifiers into a strong classifier. The weak classifiers are simple classifiers, such as decision trees or logistic regression, that can only make a limited number of correct classifications. AdaBoost assigns a weight to each classifier, which is initially set to 1/2. At each iteration, the weight of the correct classifier is incremented, while the weight of the incorrect classifiers is decremented. The coefficients \u03b1 in AdaBoost are the normalized weights of the classifiers. They are always non-negative because the weights are either incremented or left unchanged, and they are normalized so that they add up to 1.\n\nAnswer: (A) True, True",

When training a machine learning model, the goal is to minimize the difference between the model's predictions and the true values of the target variable.\n2. This is typically accomplished through the use of optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, which adjust the model's parameters in order to minimize the error on the training data.\n3.
