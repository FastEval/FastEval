            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the appropriate size of cannula for a rapid blood transfusion, we need to consider several factors. The size of the cannula will depend on the volume of blood needed to be transfused, the patient's blood flow rate, and the width of the blood vessels.\n\n1. The larger the gauge number, the smaller the diameter of the cannula. For example, an 18-gauge cannula has a larger diameter than a 22-gauge cannula. Therefore, if the blood transfusion needs to be rapid, we would want to use a cannula with the smallest possible diameter to allow for faster blood flow.\n2. In general, for rapid blood transfusion, a 20-gauge or 22-gauge cannula is typically used. These sizes have a smaller diameter than an 18-gauge cannula, which allows for faster blood flow, but they are still large enough to allow for a significant amount of blood to be transfused in a short amount of time.\n3. However, if the patient has particularly narrow blood vessels or if the blood transfusion needs to be extremely rapid, a 24-gauge cannula may be necessary. This is because the smaller diameter of the 24-gauge cannula will reduce the resistance to blood flow, allowing for faster blood transfusion.\n\nBased on these considerations, the most appropriate size of cannula for a rapid blood transfusion would be (C) 22 gauge.<|im_end|>",

During the first few seconds of sprinting, the body primarily relies on anaerobic metabolism (i.e., without oxygen) to generate energy, as the demand for energy is high and the oxygen supply to the muscles is sufficient.\n3. As the sprinting duration increases, the demand for energy continues to rise, but the oxygen supply to the muscles may not be sufficient to meet this demand.\n4. In response, the body begins to rely more on aerobic metabolism (i.e., with oxygen) to generate energy, as this process allows for a more sustained energy production.\n5.

            "model_answer": "To determine which statement correctly explains how sodium bicarbonate ingestion improves middle distance running performance, we need to understand the process of buffering capacity and the role of hydrogen ions in muscle contraction.\n\nSodium bicarbonate is a buffer substance that releases carbon dioxide when it is dissolved in the stomach. This process helps to elevate the pH of the extracellular fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds the muscle cells. The pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution, with a pH of 7 being neutral.\n\nWhen the pH of the extracellular fluid is elevated, it allows for a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from the muscle. Hydrogen ions are negatively charged particles that play a crucial role in muscle contraction. During muscle contraction, hydrogen ions are released into the extracellular fluid, which causes the pH to decrease. If the pH decreases too much, the muscle contractions can become weak and inefficient.\n\nBy elevating the pH of the extracellular fluid, sodium bicarbonate helps to maintain optimal conditions for muscle contraction. This allows for more efficient muscle contractions and can improve running performance in middle distance races, which typically last between 800 meters and 2 miles.\n\nBased on this explanation, the correct answer is (A): elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allows for a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from the muscle, which can improve middle distance running performance. The other options are incorrect because they either reduce the buffering capacity or suggest a faster influx of hydrogen ions, which would both be detrimental to muscle contraction.<|im_end|>",

Each codon corresponds to a particular amino acid, and the sequence of codons determines the sequence of amino acids in the protein.\n\n Nucleotide bases are the building blocks of DNA and RNA.
