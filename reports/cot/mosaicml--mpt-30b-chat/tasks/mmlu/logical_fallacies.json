            "model_answer": "Step 1: Let's break down each option (A, B, C, D) and explain what they mean in the context of a disjunctive syllogism.\n\n(A) Includes two or more alternatives: In a disjunctive syllogism, the major premise presents two or more alternatives. For example, \"Either it is raining or it is snowing.\"\n\n(B) Classifies subjects: In a disjunctive syllogism, the major premise categorizes or separates the subjects into different groups. For example, \"Either the students are honest or they are dishonest.\"\n\n(C) Affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent: In a disjunctive syllogism, the major premise can either affirm the antecedent (the statement before the \"or\") or deny the consequent (the statement after the \"or\"). For example, \"Either the book is blue or it is red\" (affirms antecedent) or \"Either the book is blue or it is green\" (denies consequent).\n\n(D) Leads to a valid conclusion: A valid disjunctive syllogism has a major premise that allows for a logical conclusion. For example, \"Either it is raining or it is not raining\" is invalid because it leads to a contradiction. \"Either it is raining or it is snowing\" is valid because it leads to two possible conclusions: \"It is raining\" or \"It is snowing.\"\n\nStep 2: Based on the above explanations, we can see that option (D) is the correct answer. Option (D) is the only option that directly references the requirement for a valid conclusion. The other options describe characteristics of the major premise, but they do not necessarily lead to a valid conclusion.",
