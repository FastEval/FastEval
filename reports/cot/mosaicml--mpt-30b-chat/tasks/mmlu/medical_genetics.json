            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "A Robertsonian translocation is a type of chromosomal rearrangement that occurs when two chromosomes break and fuse back together. The breakpoints for a Robertsonian translocation often occur at the centromere and the telomere of one of the chromosomes involved.\n\nSo, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) Telomeres are the caps at the ends of chromosomes that protect the DNA and prevent it from deteriorating. Telomeres do not contain genetic information, and they do not play a role in Robertsonian translocations.\n\n(B) Centromeres are the protein complexes that sit at the center of each chromosome and help to separate the chromosomes during cell division. Centromeres are important for maintaining the structure of the chromosome, but they are not involved in the process of Robertsonian translocation.\n\n(C) Histones are proteins that help to package and organize the DNA within the chromosome. Histones do not play a role in Robertsonian translocations.\n\n(D) The ends of the long arms of the chromosomes are the regions of the chromosome that extend beyond the centromere. These regions contain genetic information and are involved in the process of Robertsonian translocation because the breakpoints often occur in this area.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) the ends of the long arms.<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the genetics of an X-linked recessive condition.\n\nAn X-linked recessive condition means that the disease is caused by a mutation on the X chromosome. Males have one X chromosome (XR) and one Y chromosome (XY), while females have two X chromosomes (XX). Since males have only one X chromosome, they are more likely to be affected by an X-linked recessive condition than females, who have a second X chromosome to compensate for a mutated one.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition is 0.10, or one in ten. This means that out of 100 males, 10 are affected by the condition.\n\nWe can use the principle of Fleming's left right (2:1) ratio to determine the expected frequency of affected females. This principle states that if a trait is inherited according to a 2:1 ratio (males are two times more likely to inherit a trait than females), then the expected frequency of the trait in females is half the frequency in males.\n\nUsing Fleming's left-right ratio, the expected frequency of affected females is half the frequency of affected males:\n\nExpected frequency of affected females = 0.10 * 0.5 = 0.05\n\nTherefore, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.05, or one in twenty.\n\nAnswer: (C) 0.02<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) cytosine.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Adenine is one of the four nucleotide bases in DNA, along with cytosine, guanine, and thymine.\n2. Nucleotide bases in DNA pair up in a specific manner during the formation of DNA double helices.\n3. Adenine normally pairs with cytosine, which is a complementary base. The pairing is based on hydrogen bonding between the bases, with adenine forming two hydrogen bonds with cytosine and cytosine forming two hydrogen bonds with adenine.\n4. Guanine also pairs with cytosine, but only through three hydrogen bonds, whereas adenine-cytosine pairing forms two hydrogen bonds.\n5. Thymine can also pair with adenine, but strictly speaking, it is not considered a complementary base to adenine because it only forms two hydrogen bonds with adenine instead of the ideal two hydrogen bonds.\n6. Uracil is another nucleotide base that is found in RNA but not in DNA. It can pair with adenine in RNA, but it is not relevant to the question because it does not occur in DNA.\n7. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) cytosine.<|im_end|>",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia, we need to understand its genetic basis. Malignant hyperthermia is a genetic condition that occurs during general anesthesia and is triggered by certain volatile anesthetics and muscle relaxants. It is characterized by rapid rise in body temperature, muscle rigidity, and high metabolic demand for oxygen.\n\nThere is evidence that malignant hyperthermia is caused by mutations in the RYR1 gene, which is located on chromosome 19 and encodes the ryanodine receptor, a calcium release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. The ryanodine receptor plays a crucial role in the regulation of muscle contraction.\n\nMutations in the RYR1 gene lead to abnormal function of the ryanodine receptor, which in turn causes uncontrolled release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in muscle contraction and hyperthermia. The inheritance pattern of malignant hyperthermia is autosomal dominant, option (A).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (A) Autosomal dominant.<|im_end|>",

Mapping of human chromosomes refers to the process of identifying and locating specific genes or DNA sequences on chromosomes.\n2. Option A states that mapping of human chromosomes has been restricted to the sex chromosomes because of small family sizes. This means that the difficulty in mapping chromosomes in humans is due to the fact that human families are usually small and have less genetic variation, which makes it harder to identify the precise location of genes or DNA sequences on chromosomes.\n3. Option B is incorrect because it states that mapping proceeded much more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available. This is not necessarily true because even with a large number of DNA markers, mapping chromosomes accurately can still be difficult due to the reasons mentioned in option A.\n4. Option C is incorrect because it states that mapping has determined that the number of linkage groups is about twice the number of chromosomes. This information is not relevant to the question.\n5. Option D is incorrect because it states that mapping has demonstrated that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes.
