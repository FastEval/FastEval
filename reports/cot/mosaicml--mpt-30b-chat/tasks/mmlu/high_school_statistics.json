An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim. Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(B) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n(D) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7",

            "model_answer": "To calculate the P-value of this test, we first need to determine the test statistic (t) and its corresponding degrees of freedom (df). We can then use a probability distribution table or a calculator to find the P-value.\n\nHowever, before we do that, we need to determine the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (Ha) of this test. The manufacturer's claim is that the weight of an aspirin tablet is 300 milligrams. So, H0 is that the true mean weight of the tablets is 300 mg, and Ha is that the true mean weight is not 300 mg.\n\nNow, let's calculate the test statistic (t). We can use the formula:\n\nt = (x\u0304 - \u03bc) / (s / \u221an)\n\nwhere x\u0304 is the sample mean, \u03bc is the population mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, the sample mean (x\u0304) is 300 mg (the manufacturer's claim), and the sample standard deviation (s) is unknown. Since we don't know s, we can't directly calculate t. However, we can use the sample standard deviation estimator, which is:\n\ns / \u221an = s / \u221a(7) = s / 2.33\n\nThe sample mean (x\u0304) is 300 mg, and the sample size (n) is 7. Therefore, we can calculate the t-statistic as:\n\nt = (300 - 300) / (s / 2.33) = 0\n\nNow, we need to determine the degrees of freedom (df). Since we are using a t-distribution, the degrees of freedom are equal to the sample size (n) minus 1. In this case, df = 7 - 1 = 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the P-value. We can use a t-distribution table or a calculator to find P(t > 1.54) with df = 6. Looking up the value in the table or using a calculator, we find that the P-value is approximately 0.10.\n\nSo, the P-value of this test is 0.10. (C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7<|im_end|>",

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to evaluate a hypothesis about a population parameter based on sample data.\n2. In hypothesis testing, we start with a null hypothesis (H0), which is typically the hypothesis of no difference or no effect.\n3. We then collect sample data and calculate a test statistic that follows a specific distribution under the null hypothesis.\n4. We set a significance level (usually 0.05 or 0.01) and determine whether the test statistic falls in the region of acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis.\n5. If the test statistic falls in the region of rejection, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (H1).\n6. The power of a test is the probability of detecting an alternative hypothesis when it is true. It depends on several factors, including the sample size, the effect size, and the significance level.\n7.
