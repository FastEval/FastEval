            "question": "The waiting times for a new roller coaster ride are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. If there are 150,000 riders the first summer, which of the following is the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders?\n\n(A) 0 to 31.7 minutes\n(B) 31.7 to 39.3 minutes\n(C) 25.3 to 44.7 minutes\n(D) 25.3 to 35 minutes",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Let's start by understanding the problem. We are given that the waiting times for a new roller coaster ride are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. We also know that there are 150,000 riders the first summer.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders. This means we need to find the point on the normal distribution curve that corresponds to 100,000 riders, which will give us the shortest waiting time for 100,000 riders.\n\nTo do this, we can use the properties of the normal distribution. The total area under the curve of a normal distribution is equal to 1. We can think of this as dividing the area under the curve into two equal parts. The area to the left of the mean will be equal to 1/2, and the area to the right of the mean will also be equal to 1/2.\n\nNext, we need to find the standard deviation. A standard deviation of 10 minutes means that 95% of the riders will wait between 10 minutes less than the mean and 10 minutes more than the mean. This can be calculated as:\n\n35 minutes - 10 minutes = 25 minutes and 35 minutes + 10 minutes = 45 minutes\n\nSo, 95% of the riders will wait between 25 minutes and 45 minutes. This means that the remaining 5% of the riders will wait outside this range.\n\nNow, we need to find the point on the normal distribution curve that corresponds to 100,000 riders. Since there are 150,000 riders in total, this means that 100,000 riders are to the left of this point, and 50,000 riders are to the right of this point.\n\nWe know that the area to the left of the mean is equal to 1/2, and since 100,000 riders are to the left of the point, this means that 1/2 of the total area to the left of the mean is associated with 100,000 riders.\n\n1/2 = (100,000 / 150,000)\n\n1/2 = 2/3\n\nNow, we need to find the point on the normal distribution curve that corresponds to 2/3 of the area to the left of the mean. We know that the standard deviation is 10 minutes, and the mean is 35 minutes. So, we can calculate the point on the curve using the following formula:\n\nx = mean - (standard deviation * z)\n\nwhere x is the point on the curve, and z is the value of the standard normal distribution that corresponds to 2/3 of the area to the left of the mean.\n\nWe can find z using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator. Looking up z = 2/3, we get:\n\nz = 0.434\n\nNow, we can calculate the point on the curve:\n\nx = 35 - (10 * 0.434)\nx = 35 - 4.34\nx = 30.66\n\nSo, the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is between 30.66 minutes and 35 minutes. The answer is (D) 25.3 to 35 minutes.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Explanation\n\nHypothesis testing is a statistical method used to test a hypothesis about a population parameter based on sample data. In hypothesis testing, we typically start with a null hypothesis (H0), which is the hypothesis we want to test. The null hypothesis usually assumes that there is no significant difference between two groups or that a parameter is equal to a certain value. We then collect sample data and choose an appropriate statistical test to evaluate the null hypothesis.\n\nStep 2: Explanation (continued)\n\nThe statistical test we choose will have a specific significance level, which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (also known as the Type I error rate). The significance level is usually chosen to be 0.05 or 0.01, which are common levels of confidence in statistical analysis.\n\nStep 3: Explanation (continued)\n\nNow, let's consider the four options given:\n\nA) If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level.\n\nThis statement is true in general. If we have sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at one level of significance, we also have sufficient evidence to reject it at a more stringent level of significance.\n\nB) Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.\n\nThis statement is false. The decision to use a one- or two-sided test should be made before collecting the data. A one-sided test compares the sample mean or proportion to a specific value, while a two-sided test compares it to a range of values. The choice of test depends on the research question and the alternative hypothesis being tested.\n\nC) If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nThis statement is true. If we conduct a hypothesis test at a 1% level of significance, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This means that if we perform the test multiple times with different samples, we would expect to reject the null hypothesis 1% of the time when it is actually true.\n\nStep 4: Output\n\nC",

The probability of a Type I error is the alpha level, which is 0.05 in this case.\n\nA Type II error is when the null hypothesis is not rejected despite being false.
