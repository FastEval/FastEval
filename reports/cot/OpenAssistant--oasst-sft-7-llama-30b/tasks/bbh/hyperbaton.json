However, in general, adjectives can be ordered according to their importance or specificity. For example, poets and literary figures frequently play by different rules.\n\nA: midsize old grey Brazilian sweater\nThis sentence could be possible if grey is more important adjective than old. However, brazilian could be even more important. For example, a brazilian sweater is a type of sweater whereas grey is a color. Therefore, this order could be possible if grey and midsize have strong connotations for the speaker/writer.\n\nB: midsize grey Brazilian old sweater\nThis sentence could be more plausible to me as it is more specific to say something is a Brazilian sweater rather than midsize or old.\n\nIf the intent behind the question is a riddle, then neither answer is immediately clear that it is more or less correct than the other. However, the blue code seems more stylistic to me:\n\nB",

Adjectives can be placed in different orders depending on the intended meaning.\n* Common adjective orders include:\n\t+ determiner (article, possessive) followed by opinion\n\t+ determiner followed by size, shape, age\n\t+ general opinion followed by determiner\n* So, in this case, we want to identify which adjective order is suitable to describe a rectangular cloth on a smoking motorcycle in English.\n* The options we have are:\n\t+ cloth smoking rectangular motorcycle\n\t+ rectangular cloth smoking motorcycle\n* Based on the common adjective orders, both options could be considered to fit one of the orders.\n* Opinion is followed by detail, so (B) rectangular cloth smoking motorcycle could be a possible option.\n* Another factor to consider is the intended purpose of the sentence. In this case, it seems that the sentence is meant to describe the appearance of the object.\n* So, based on this analysis, the answer is (B) rectangular cloth smoking motorcycle.\n\nAnswer: (B) rectangular cloth smoking motorcycle.\nParentheses with no additional text.",

In English, adjectives are usually placed in this order: determiner, adjective, optional adjective (often called a \"degree\" adjective), optional adjective (often called a \"dimension\" adjective).\n\nStep 2: Determine the parts of speech of the words in each sentence. In sentence (A), \"nice\" is an adjective, \"American\" is an adjective, and \"computer\" is a noun. In sentence (B), \"American\" is an adjective, \"nice\" is an adjective, and \"computer\" is a noun.\n\nStep 3: Check the adjective order rule to determine whether the adjectives are in the correct order. In sentence (A), the order is \"nice (determiner) American computer,\" which is not correct because the determiner should come first. In sentence (B), the order is \"American (adjective) nice computer,\" which is not correct because degree and dimension adjectives should come before optional adjectives.\n\nStep 4: Check the order of the adjectives based on the starting letter of each adjective. In sentence (A), \"nice\" comes before \"American,\" and in sentence (B), \"American\" comes before \"nice.\" This can help reveal any patterns or exceptions to the standard adjective order rule.\n\nStep 5: Determine the correct adjective order based on the previous steps. In this case, the adjectives are not in the correct order in either sentence. If we were comparing two sentences that were equally grammatically correct, we would choose the one that follows the standard adjective order rule and has a reasonable meaning (e.g. \"American computer\" is more likely to make sense than \"nice computer\"). However, if we were comparing two sentences that were equally grammatically correct, we would choose the one that follows the standard adjective order rule and has a reasonable meaning (e.g. \"American computer\" is more likely to make sense than \"nice computer\").
