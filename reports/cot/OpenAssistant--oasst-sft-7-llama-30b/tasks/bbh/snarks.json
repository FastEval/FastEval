This statement appears to be exaggerated to suggest that it is easy to overcome poverty, which is unlikely.\n\nStep 3: Next, consider statement (B). This statement appears to be sarcastic because it suggests that being rude is \"much easier.\" This is unlikely to be true, as being polite is the default behavior in most social situations.
