It is not specified how many times Melissa switches with Claire (one switch listed), but there is no mention of Melissa switching with either Bob or Dave (one switch listed).\n5. Alice and Patrick are not mentioned trading partners (nor is there any listed instance of Claire switching with Patrick), so it is not likely Alice is dancing with Patrick at the end of the dance (E in the answer options).\n6. It then must be one of either Ophelia, Jamie, or Rodrigo (as Bob, Claire, or Eve did not switch with Alice).\n7. If Claire switched with Ophelia during the dance, there would be no reason for Alice to switch with Ophelia (as Alice and Ophelia would still be together).\n8.

However, it then listed dancers switching partners in the order Claire and Bob switch, then Claire and Eve switch (with no mention in between of Bob or Dave switching with Claire).\n10.

It is likely Claire and Bob did not switch then, as this would have been mentioned in the list.\n12. However, Claire listed switching with Bob twice (and in the middle of tradings with Alice, Melissa, Eve, and Dave), so it is likely Claire and Bob switched partners (as then listed dancers only switched with each other once each).\n13.

As the game progresses, pairs of players trade balls, so if Alice has the pink ball at the end of the game, the pairs that must have traded incorrectly are Claire and Alice and Eve and Bob.\nTo determine which pair provided the incorrectly swapped balls, we must find the pair which swapped the only other ball provided. The other four balls present are all paper cases for smaller balls, and do not match the balls that Alice nor the unaccounted paper cases match against. Thus, only Dave and Bob traded other colored balls. As all paper cases match against other balls, and Dave and Bob traded other colored balls which are all paper cases for smaller balls, the only other pair provided incorrectly swapped balls is Claire and Alice.
