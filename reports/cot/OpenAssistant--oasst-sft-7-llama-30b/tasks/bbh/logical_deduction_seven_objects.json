This means the convertible is the third-oldest, as the station wagon, the third-newest vehicle, is in the same age group as the convertible but comes after it.\n\nStep 6: The sixth sentence tells us the truck is newer than the bus. Since the bus is older than the tractor, we can conclude the truck is also older than the tractor.\n\nStep 7: The seventh sentence tells us the hatchback is older than the convertible, which we determined in step 5 is the third-oldest vehicle.
