            "question": "The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. A fruit stand sells seven fruits: plums, kiwis, cantaloupes, pears, watermelons, apples, and loquats. The watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes. The apples are less expensive than the cantaloupes. The watermelons are the second-most expensive. The loquats are less expensive than the kiwis. The apples are more expensive than the loquats. The loquats are the third-cheapest. The plums are the cheapest.\nOptions:\n(A) The plums are the most expensive\n(B) The kiwis are the most expensive\n(C) The cantaloupes are the most expensive\n(D) The pears are the most expensive\n(E) The watermelons are the most expensive\n(F) The apples are the most expensive\n(G) The loquats are the most expensive",
            "correct_answer": "(B)",
            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, we can determine that the correct answer is (G) The loquats are the most expensive.\n\nThe paragraph states that the plums are the cheapest. This means that all other fruits are more expensive than the plums. Therefore, either the kiwis, cantaloupes, pears, watermelons, apples, or loquats could be the most expensive fruit.\n\nThe paragraph then provides some additional information about the price of the watermelons, apples, and loquats:\n\n1. The watermelons are more expensive than the cantaloupes (but less expensive than some other fruits)\n2. The apples are less expensive than the cantaloupes\n3. The loquats are less expensive than the kiwis (but more expensive than some other fruits)\n4. The apples are more expensive than the loquats.\n\nFrom this information, we know that the watermelon is priced between the apple and the loquat. This means that the loquat can't be the most expensive fruit, nor can the kiwi (since the loquat is less expensive than it), so the most expensive fruit must be one of the plums, pears, cantaloupes, or apples.\n\nSince we know that the watermelon is priced between the apple and the loquat, we can use this information to eliminate more potential answers. Since the watermelon is less expensive than the apple, and the loquat is less expensive than the kiwi, we know that the apples cannot be the most expensive fruit. Since the watermelon is more expensive than the cantaloupes, and we know that the kiwi is less expensive than the k in the paragraph (since it comes after), we know that the cantaloupes cannot be the most expensive fruit.\n\nThis means that the most expensive fruit must be either a pear or a plum. However, the single paragraph does not give any information about pricing of pears, so we do not know if they are more or less expensive than plums.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (G) The loquats are the most expensive.",

The first paragraph implies that the station wagon, bus, convertible, minivan, and truck are all older than the minivan, bus, and tractor.\n\nStep 2: Use process of elimination to determine the answer. The second paragraph states that the station wagon is the fourth-newest object, which means the 3 oldest objects are: 1) the convertible, 2) the tractor, and 3) the Republican party bus. The third paragraph indicates that the minivan is the third-newest vehicle, which means that the 2nd and 3rd oldest vehicles are the bus and the station wagon. Therefore, the answer cannot be (A), (B), (C), (D), (E).\n\nStep 3: Consider the remaining option (F) and determine if it aligns with the conditions set up in the paragraphs.",
