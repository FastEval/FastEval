Bob starts the dance dancing with Melissa. We know he ends the dance dancing with someone, but we don't know who it is.\n3. Claire starts the dance dancing with Lola. We know she ends the dance dancing with someone, but we don't know who it is.\n4. Through the dance, these are the only three people who could have been dancing with each other:\n- Izzi and Melissa never danced together\n- Izzi and Lola never danced together\n- Melissa and Lola never danced together\n- Alice, Bob, and Claire each danced with at least one of the others\n\nWe know Alice must have been dancing with someone at the end of the dance because we know she didn't start the dance dancing with Izzi, Melissa, or Lola. Whether it's (B) Bob or (C) Lola, it must be one of two people. However, we know that must be either a person who is not dancing with their intended partner (since we know that everyone ended the dance dancing with someone different than they started the dance with) and yet was dancing with a person who was unavailable at the start of the dance (since Alice did not start the dance dancing with Bob or Lola). That's a bit of a contradiction. So we'd have to rule out (B) Bob and (C) Lola in this case.\n\nSo we know that at the end we have a configuration where one dancer is available and one dancer is not:\n- If Claire and Bob are dancing, we know only one of Melissa or Izzi is available to dance with Alice\n- If Claire and Izzi are dancing, we know only one of Lola or Melissa is available to dance with Alice\n- If Claire and Lola are dancing, we know only one of Melissa or Izzi is available to dance with Alice\n\nSo we know that if Alice and Bob haven't already traded partners, then Claire and Alice must have. Since Alice started off dancing with Izzi, we also know the person that Melissa is dancing with is not dancing with Alice. It follows that Melissa is dancing with Lola, and Alice is dancing with (B) Bob, and therefore Alice ends the dance dancing with Bob.
