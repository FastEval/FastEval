We know there are three grey cat toys and three grey notebooks, so the total so far is (3+3) = <<3+3=6>>6 grey objects.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of purple notebooks from the total count of objects to get the remaining count of grey objects. There are two purple notebooks, so if we remove them, there will be (6-2) = <<6-2=4>>4 grey objects remaining on the floor.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) three grey objects.\n\nNote: I apologize for the mistake in my previous response.
