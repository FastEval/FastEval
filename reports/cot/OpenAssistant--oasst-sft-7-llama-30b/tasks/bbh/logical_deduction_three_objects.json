            "model_answer": "(B) The blue jay is the rightmost.\n\nHere's how we can reason through this question step-by-step:\n\n1. We have three birds on a branch: a robin, a blue jay, and a crow.\n2. We are given two statements about their positions relative to each other: the robin is to the right of the crow, and the robin is to the left of the blue jay.\n\nNow, we need to consider the possible arrangements of these birds based on these statements:\n\n1. If the robin is to the right of the crow, then we have three possibilities:\na. The robin is the rightmost (A)\nb. The blue jay is the rightmost if the robin is to the left of the blue jay (B)\nc. The crow is the rightmost if the robin is to the right of the blue jay (C)\n1. Based on the second statement that the robin is to the left of the blue jay, we know option (C) is not possible because we already know the robin is not the rightmost bird.\n2. Options (A) and (B) are possible arrangements, but we need to consider the logical consistency within the paragraph. If the robin is the rightmost bird (A), then the blue jay is to the left of the robin, which contradicts the statement that the robin is to the left of the blue jay. Therefore, option (B) is the only logical arrangement that satisfies all the statements.\n3. Therefore, the answer is (B) The blue jay is the rightmost.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we can start by identifying the key information provided in the statement. We know that there are three books on a shelf, and the first two books are arranged in a specific order: the green book is to the left of the blue book, and the red book is to the right of both of them.\n\nNext, we can consider the meaning of each of the options given in the question.\n\n(A) If the green book is the rightmost, then the green book is to the left of the other two books. This statement contradicts the initial information given, which tells us that the green book is to the left of the blue book. Therefore, option (A) is not the correct answer.\n\n(B) If we consider option (B), we know that the red book is the rightmost, meaning that it is to the right of the other two books. This lines up with the information given in the question. However, we also know that the green book is to the left of the blue book. If the red book is the rightmost object, and the green book is to the left of the blue book, then the blue book must be positioned between the red book and the green book. Therefore, option (B) is not the correct answer.\n\n(C) Now we consider option (C), which reads: \"The blue book is the rightmost.\" This creates a logical contradiction, because we know that the red book is to the right of the other two books. If the blue book is the rightmost object, then it must be located between the red book and the green book. However, the red book is already placed next to the blue book. Therefore, option (C) is not the correct answer.\n\nBased on our line of reasoning, we can conclude that none of the options given in the question are correct. The correct answer is \"none of the above,\" meaning that there is no logical way to arrange these books on a shelf in a way that satisfies all of the given conditions.",

            "model_answer": "(B) The yellow book is the second from the left.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\nThe prompt provides a description of a set of three books arranged in a fixed order on a shelf. The order is established by the statements that the blue book is to the right of the yellow book, and the orange book is the second from the left.\n\nFirst, let us consider all possible positions of the orange book. According to the description, the orange book must be:\n| Orange book | Position |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1st from the left | 1 |\n| 2nd from the left | 2 |\n| 3rd from the left | 3 |\n| 2nd from the right | 3 |\n| 3rd from the right | 2 |\n| Rightmost | 1 |\n\nThe orange book cannot be the rightmost, as it is mentioned as being the second from the left. So, the orange book must be at position --> 2.\n\nNow, let us consider all possible positions of the yellow book. We know that\n| Yellow book | Position |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2nd from the left except rightmost | 1 |\n| 3rd from the left | 2 |\n| 2nd from the right | 3 |\n| 1st from the right | 1 |\n| ? | 2 |\n| 3rd from the right | 3 |\n| Rightmost | 1 |\n| ? | 2 |\n| ? | 3 |\n| 1st from the left | 1 |\n| 2nd from the left except rightmost | 2 |\n| 3rd from the left | 3 |\n\nThe case for yellow being at position --> 2 is possible because 2nd from the right and 3rd from the right are not specified as being correct positions.\n\nTherefore, multiple answer options --> A, B, C could be correct. However, option B is most likely the correct answer as yellow being the second from the right is not clear and only rules out yellow at position 1.",
