To determine the probability of each answer option, we use the following logic:\n\n1. The orange book is the second from the left (P(A)). To calculate the probability of this option, we first use the given statement \"The orange book is the second from the left\" to update our beliefs about the arrangement of the books. This probability is not affected by the other statements, so it remains at 1.0.\n2. The probability of the yellow book being second from the left (P(B)) is higher than the probability of the orange book being second from the left, because there are two options for the position of the yellow book (second from the left or right adjacent to the orange book). Nevertheless, probability of yellow book is not directly after orange book, because probability of blue book is after yellow and blue book is to the right of yellow book, adjacent to orange book. So P(B) = (2/3) * 1.0 = 0.8\n3. The probability of the blue book being second from the left (P(C)) is very low, because the probability of the yellow book being directly after the orange book is very low. In addition, the probability of the yellow book being directly after the orange book adjacent to the blue book is even lower probability of yellow book is not directly after orange book, because probability of blue book is after yellow and blue book is to the right of yellow book, adjacent to orange book. So P(C) = (3/3) * 0.0 = 0.0% probability of yellow book is not directly after orange book, because probability of blue book is after yellow and blue book is to the right of yellow book, adjacent to orange book.

The input describes a set of three books arranged in a fixed order, with each book being to the right of the previous book (black book > orange book > blue book).\n2. The arrangement of the books allows only one book to be the first, and we don't know which book is the first (so no answer choice is correct)\n3. However, we can say that the orange book is second from the left because, if we assign the orange book as the first book, then moving right, the black book is the second book, and then the blue book is the third book. Same if the blue book is the first book, and then orange book is the second, moving right, the black book is the third. So answer is (B) The orange book is the second from the left.\n4.
