The time difference was +0600 so we need to do the calculation on the UTC time. The current local time was 3:02 UTC-6 but was equivalent to 9:02 UTC. So the date a year ago will be 9:02 UTC on the specified date. I have chosen a date that seemed where there was no chance of the time changing to/from daylight savings time. I do not hold the chance that the user is in a location where the time changed on that day where I hold no chance of doing the calculation correctly. The date was April 5th 2020. I calculated the difference in minutes since the local time was 3:02 UTC-6 and the UTC time was 9:02 UTC. I then do the same for April 5th 2020 to April 5th 2021 getting the difference in minutes. If we assume the local time on April 5th 2021 was also 3:02 UTC-6 then we can figure out the chance that the user is in a location where the time changed on April 5th 2021 (Specifically on the local time where we are located where there was no chance!)\nIf the user was located in the location where we are located where there was no chance!)\nIf the user was located in the location where we are located where there was no chance!)\nIf the user was located in the location where we are located where there was no chance!)\nIf the user was located in the location where we are located where there was no chance!)\nIf the user was located in the location where we are located where there was no chance!)\nIf the user was located in the location where we are located where there was no chance!)\nIf the user was located in the location where we are located where there was no chance!)\nIf the user was located in the location where we are located where there was no chance!)\nIf the user was located in the location where we are located where there was no chance!)\nIf the user was located in the location where we are located where there was no chance!)\nIf the user was located in the location where we are located where there was no chance!)\nIf the user was located in the location where we are located where there was no chance!)",
