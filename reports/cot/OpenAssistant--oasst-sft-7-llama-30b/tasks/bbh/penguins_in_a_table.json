Since there is no absolute reference, it is safe to assume that Jane, Julia and Simon might not be in the penguin table or there might be more penguins that we are not aware of. Therefore, before proceeding to count the number of penguins, it makes sense to check the current penguin data present and decide if we are on a elevator or a bus or what.\n3. Looking at the penguin table before James is added, we notice that there are 3 penguins in the table.\n3. We now learn that James has all the properties of the other three penguins (name, age, height, weight).\n4. If we were to use the prior data (3 penguins) to predict how many penguins we will have in the table, after the new penguin James is added, we might be led astray by the large number of total novel data points from James.\n5. We can use Bayes theorem to update the data probability resulting in a higher probability that the new penguin would be a penguin, (assuming our past data is 3 penguins)\n6. Now we decide just to count penguins, for example, by counting three penguins chocolate chip cookies or three chocolate chips in chocolate chip cookies. Of course this method leaves open the possibility that there might be GMO occasionally spliced penguins! \n7. It is now clear the total number of penguins and chocolate cookies is three. (TBD analysis)\n7. The answer is (A) 1. No matter what, we got one single penguin. \n8. The penguins must form a ring ((A) 1).\n\nIn conclusion, we can assume based on the prior data that there are 3 penguins among 3 penguins. James is added with the four same properties as the prior three penguins, possibly to be seen as independent data. But Bayes says there probably should be ... Another way to look at this is to avoid unnecessary prior probabilities and just take the evenly weighted Bayesian view. Finally, the new penguin is added to make 4 penguins. And then we decide to skip that extra step of learning those properties and just assume when we count three penguins we know we got three penguins. We find that the number 2 did not appear so the answer is not 2 and not 3 and not 4. The answer to the question, is the answer (A) 1.",
