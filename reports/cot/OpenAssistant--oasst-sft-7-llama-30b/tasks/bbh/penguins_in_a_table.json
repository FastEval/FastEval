All penguins are 5 years old or older because the minimum age is 7. It is possible, therefore, that there are no penguins weighing more than 12 kg, or there are penguins weighing between 12 kg and 15 kg.\n3. Let's check the ages of each penguin. For Louis, James, Vincent, and Gwen, the ages are 7, 12, 9, and 8, respectively.\n4. We now need to check the weight of each penguin, and compare it to the threshold of 12 kg. Let's do it step by step. The weight of Louis is 11 kg, which is smaller than 12 kg. The weight of James is 12 kg, which is exactly the threshold. The weight of Vincent is 11 kg, which is again smaller than 12 kg. Finally, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, which is greater than 12 kg.\n5.

Louis, age 5\n\nNext, we need to compare the ages of the giraffes to the age of 5 to see which ones are more than 5 years old.\n\n1. Gladys is more than 5 years old.\n2.

            "model_answer": "Let's start by looking at the penguin table and identifying the age of the last penguin:\n\n* Louis: age 7\n* Bernard: age 5\n* Vincent: age 9\n* Gwen: age 8\n* James: age 12\n\nSince the age of the last penguin is 12, we know that the last giraffe is Gladys (age 10). Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) Gladys",
