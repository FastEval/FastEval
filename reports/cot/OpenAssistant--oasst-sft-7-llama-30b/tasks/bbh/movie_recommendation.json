Reasoning:\n\n- All of the given movies are organized crime stories. Pulp Fiction is a movie about a crime story resulting from a decision of a couple of professional criminals just for fun and money (the hamburger scene), rather than the criminality of those who commit crime as a means of living. Similarly, Braveheart is about the struggle of a freedom fighter against the UK in the medieval times. Shawshank Redemption is about the life of a wrongly sentenced prisoner and his journey. The Crimson Tide depicts the struggle between two men over the use of a non-existent missile. The Fugitive is about a doctor who was wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and who jumps out of a window of a courthouse to get absent from the police to later prove his innocence. Like the movies listed above, it is also about the consequences of actions. Also, all the movies listed above have no connection to organized crime and emphasize freedom or the consequences of freedom in some way, shape, or form.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is (C) The Fugitive.",
