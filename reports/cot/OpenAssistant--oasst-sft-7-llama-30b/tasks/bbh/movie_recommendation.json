For example, I could consider the movie's genres as drama, action, crime, and war. I could also consider movie themes such as justice, redemption, and survival. I could also consider movie ratings such as IMDB ratings, Rotten Tomatoes ratings, and Metacritic ratings.\n2. Narrow down the options: Then I would narrow down the options by identifying movies that match these key characteristics. For instance, movies that are rated highly by movie critics and audiences, movies that have received prestigious awards, or movies that have been well-received by a significant number of people. I could also use movie recommendation systems to find movies that are similar to Pulp Fiction, Braveheart, The Shawshank Redemption, and Crimson Tide.\n3.
