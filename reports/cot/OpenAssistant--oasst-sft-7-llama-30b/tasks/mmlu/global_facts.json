            "model_answer": "Here are my steps for answering the above question:\n\n1. Knowledge: PFO LOMCEP\n\n2. Read the question: \"As of 2019, about what percentage of people from the United States says homosexuality should be accepted by society?\"\n\n3. The question states that we are looking for the approximate percentage of people in the United States that believe that homosexuality should be accepted by society.\n\n4. The PFO acronym is useful here, it stands for Published Fraction of Opinion.\n\n5. The LOMCEP theory states that this percentage will vary depending on the specific referenced community, but that within that community it is usually 'somewhere around 50%'. This does not contradict that straightforward question, if we were to poll many different US communities or groups, we might get actual numbers that are very different from 50%, but we can assume a broad overview.\n\n6. Thus the answer is: (B) 62%\n\nDoes that answer what you are looking for?",

            "model_answer": "Lower respiratory infections are the leading cause of death in children under five years old (as of 2017).\n\nThe reason that explains this answer is that respiratory infections are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide, representing approximately one-third of all child deaths. These infections usually affect the lower respiratory tract and can cause pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and various other respiratory infections.\n\nLower respiratory infections are particularly dangerous in young children due to their underdeveloped immune systems and often limited access to healthcare. The global under-five mortality rate due to lower respiratory infections decreased between 1990 and 2017, but it still remains a significant public health problem in many countries.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Lower respiratory infections.\n\n(A)",
