The packets must be reassembled upon receipt.\n\nExplanation: When an HTTP request is made to a web server, the response is divided into smaller packets (segmented) and sent over the internet. The packets must be reassembled when they reach their destination.\n\n(B) The file is broken into packets for transmission. The user's browser must request each packet in order until all packets are received.\n\nExplanation: The packets are sent via HTTP, which uses a connection-based protocol.

            "model_answer": "Answer:\n\nEach of the four options describes a different type of lossless transformation of a digital image, which means that the original image can be restored exactly from the new image.\n\nLet's analyze the options step-by-step:\n\n(A) Compressing the image in a way that may lose information but will suffer only a small loss of image quality.\n\nA lossless transformation does not lose any information from the original image. While compression may reduce the file size of the image, it may also introduce some artifacts and loss of quality. Therefore, option (A) does not describe a lossless transformation.\n\n(B) Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image. The new value of each pixel represents a shade of gray, ranging from white to black.\n\nCreating the gray scale of an image is a conversion from the RGB color space to the grayscale color space. However, this transformation does not preserve the original information from the RGB triplet in each pixel. Instead, it averages the values of red, green, and blue and assigns the new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image. Therefore, option (B) does not describe a lossless transformation.\n\n(C) Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed.\n\nCreating the negative of an image is also a transformation that preserves the original information in each pixel. This transformation is achieved by subtracting the original values of the RGB triplet from 255, which inverts the intensity values. Therefore, option (C) describes a lossless transformation of the digital image.\n\n(D) Modifying part of the image by taking the pixels in one part of the picture and copying them to the pixels in another part of the picture.\n\nModifying a part of an ima",
