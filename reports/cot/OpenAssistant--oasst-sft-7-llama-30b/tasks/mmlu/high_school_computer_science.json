            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Correct answer: (C) 8\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Python 3, the operator \"<<\" is the bitwise left shift operator. It shifts all bits of the number to the left by the specified number of positions. For example, x << 2 would shift the number in x to the left two places.\n\nGiven the value of x = 1:\n\n1 << 3 = 1 [(1 << 3) = 1]\n\nSince the value of x is 1, when we apply the left shift operator to it with a value of 3, the value does not change, as the bits do not have any room to shift. Therefore, the final answer is (C) 8.",

            "model_answer": "(A) int(x [,base])\n\nExplanation:\nThe `int()` function in Python is used to convert a string to an integer. The first argument to the `int()` function is the string that needs to be converted. The optional second argument, `base`, specifies the base of the number system to use for the conversion. The function returns the integer value of the string.\n\nTherefore, (A) `int(x [,base])` is the correct function to convert a string to an int in Python 3.",

            "model_answer": "The correct solution is (A), as the file is broken into packets for transmission and the packets must be reassembled upon receipt.\n\nExplanation: When a user enters a Web address into a browser, the browser sends a request to a Web server for a specific file, such as a web page or image. The server receives the request and sends back a response, which is a set of packets containing the requested file.\n\nEach of these packets is a small unit of data that contains a unique identifier and the data for the file. When the packets are sent to the user, they are broken up and sent in a random order across the Internet. The user's browser receives the packets and reassembles them in the correct order using the unique identifiers. This process is known as packet reassembly, and it is a fundamental aspect of how data is transmitted over the Internet.\n\nThe correct answer is therefore (A), as the file is broken into packets for transmission, and these packets must be reassembled upon receipt.",

In the case of processing large amounts of data, we need to consider factors that can affect the ability of the program to process larger data sets.\n3. A common consideration in processing large data sets is the processing time required by the program. If it takes a long time, the program may not be able to process larger data sets as quickly, which can affect its efficiency (A).\n4. Another important consideration could be the number of programming statements the program contains. A program with a large number of statements may require more time to execute, which can affect its processing time and efficiency (B).\n5. The amount of memory and storage required by the program is also a consideration in processing large data sets. A program that requires large amounts of memory and storage space may not be able to process larger data sets efficiently (C, D).\n6. Of all the items listed, (A) and (B) are most likely to influence program efficiency when processing large data sets. However, (B) is the least likely because as a program grows in size, the number of programming statements may not necessarily impact its efficiency as much as (A).\n7. So, the answer is (B) How many programming statements the program contains.",

            "model_answer": "The hexadecimal system uses 16 different symbols to represent integers, specifically the numbers 0 to 15 (0 to F). In a two-digit hexadecimal number, the first digit represents the tens place and the second digit represents the ones place, similar to the base-10 numbering system. For example, the hexadecimal number 3A represents the base-10 integer 56.\n\nTo determine the largest base-10 integer that can be represented with a two-digit hexadecimal number, we need to consider the range of integers that can be represented with each digit. In the base-10 numbering system, a two-digit number can represent integers from 0 to 99. In the hexadecimal numbering system, each digit can represent the numbers 0 to F, which corresponds to the range of integers from 0 to 15.\n\nTo determine which digit can represent the largest integer, we need to compare the range of the tens and ones place. The tens place in a two-digit hexadecimal number can represent integers from 0 to F, or 0 to 15. The ones place can represent integers from 0 to 9 or 0 to 0xFFFF in hexadecimal notation.\n\nTherefore, the largest base-10 integer that can be represented with a two-digit hexadecimal number is 255, which corresponds to the hexadecimal number F.\n\nAnswer:\n\n(C) 255",
