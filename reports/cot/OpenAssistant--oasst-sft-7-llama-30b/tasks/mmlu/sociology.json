In the context of urban sociology, this would mean examining the relationships between humans and their urban environment, as well as how humans interact with each other in an urban setting.\n\nStep 3: The question asks about what the ecological approach to urban sociology involves studying. The list of options includes studying how social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources (A), the forms of wildlife and natural habitats that could be found on the edges of the city (B), the way in which people organized collective protests about environmental issues (C), and how men and women used the city's public spaces differently (D).\n\nStep 4: Let's eliminate options that are not related to the ecological approach to urban sociology. Option B, studying wildlife and natural habitats, seems unlikely to be studied in an urban setting, where there is a much larger human population. Option D, studying how men and women used public spaces differently, is also not directly related to the ecological approach, as it does not directly address the interactions between humans and their environment.\n\nStep 5: The remaining options involve studying how social groups interact with each other and with their environment.

            "model_answer": "The answer to this question is (B), \"learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career\". To reach this conclusion, we can consider the following logic:\n\n1. The question is about the statement made by Becker in the 1970s about cannabis use.\n2. (A) states that cannabis use increased throughout all sections of youth in the 1970s. This statement does not match what Becker was known for or what he is associated with in the 1970s.\n3. (C) states that cannabis use was a dangerous pastime that young people should not be allowed to pursue. Again, this does not match what Becker was known for or what he is associated with in the 1970s.\n4. (D) states that cannabis use was not as enjoyable as other sociologists had suggested. This does not match the general focus of Becker's work or the 1970s context of his statements about cannabis use.\n5. Therefore, the answer is likely to be (B), \"learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career\", as this is aligned with Becker's sociological focus on deviance and the context of his statements about drug use in the 1970s.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Answer: D. By definition, middle class typically refers to a specific socio-economic group; thus an answer that applies to multiple outcomes would be unlikely. Part (A) applies to development of middle classes in many places and times, not just the 19th century; part (B) is accurate but only applies to some middle classes, depending on local factors; part (C) is similarly only true of some middle classes.\n\nExplanation: From my understanding of the 19th century history curriculum in multiple countries (as well as a vague memories of an Anthropology subject in my undergraduate education), the development of the middle classes was a part of a larger social and economic movement across the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe process of mechanization of agriculture and, more generally, work in the 19th century led to new leisure activities likely fought for by social groups of the time seeking to separate themselves from more manual trades. Power spends money on leisure in order to show power, so the existence of opulent hobbies promotes their serial adoption across the middle class. Physical and mental leisure helps to relieve the work career and, in the case of several leisure activities, creates a target for the class as a whole to \u201cachieve\u201d to show power or connection. Over time, social classes arise in very similar ways; socio-economically, anecdotally, and genealogically. These social classes feed and protect one another, where one social class seeks to be similar to a higher-up class (reflecting as ordinary humans we would all like to associate with better-looking, richer, or more powerful people---concern varies as per individuals), and relies on a social class or classes below to spend money on goods and services provided by an upward, gradually identical social class (and the family, firms, businesses, etc. below). Together, these efforts create the hierarchies of social classes we experience in roughly any modern nation or city. Some of those hierarchies stereotype. We have a",

With the advancement of technology, various forms of surveillance have become easier and more efficient.\n\nA) One technological form of surveillance that has made it easier to access and exchange private information about consumers is online data collection and tracking. This includes cookies and other types of software used to monitor a person's online activity, as well as the collection of personal data through online forms and surveys.\n\nB) Another form of surveillance that has been facilitated by technology is the use of electronic tagging for monitoring individuals' movements. This technology is commonly used in prison systems to monitor prisoners' whereabouts and movements, and to enforce curfews and other restrictions.\n\nC) Technological forms of surveillance have also made it easier to monitor employees' activities at work, through the use of computer and video monitoring systems. This includes the use of keylogging software to monitor a person's computer activity, as well as video cameras used to monitor employee behavior.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is that technological forms of surveillance have made it easier to access and exchange private information about consumers, reduce prison overcrowding by the use of electronic tagging, and monitor employees' activities at work.

It is contrasted with Gesellschaft , which refers to a type of social group, characterized by impersonal, instrumental relationships, where people are largely concerned with their own self-interest and individual goals.\n\nWe also need to know that Durkheim's concept of mechanical solidarity refers to social cohesion in mechanical solidarity societies is based on shared values and norms that unite all members of the society united by a common consciousness or collective mentality.\n\nAnomie refers to normlessness and a state of confusion or disorientation when people are no longer able to determine what is right from wrong, or what is acceptable from unacceptable behavior.\n\nNow let's look at the options:\n\n(A) Organic solidarity refers to social cohesion in organic solidarity societies is based on shared goals, interests, and values that unite all members of the society. It is a form of solidarity that is characterized by the interdependence of its members, where every part is necessary for the functioning of the whole.\n\n(B) Mechanical solidarity: As I mentioned, mechanical solidarity refers to a type of social cohesion in mechanical solidarity societies is based on shared values and norms that unite all members of the society. It is characterized by all individuals believing and behaving in the same way, and this form of solidarity is achieved through social bond",

The lower a group\u2019s share of people (compared to the proportion of income they receive) the more that group would benefit from progressive taxes. A Poverty Test, described by K. Rowntree and B.

B) The emergence of new job types or industries often skews employment to certain occupations over others, this could by evident in the number of people in professional jobs and has nothing to do with income inequality. C) rising costs of consumer goods can weaken one\u2019s ability to acquire goods. It is possible that this contributed to lower real, inflation-adjusted income for lower earners. This could be a reason. However, if earnings rise less than the general price of all goods then everyone is (slightly) poorer. Rising earnings may (if they are faster growing than the general prices) be a good reason why inequality would fall. The opposite is true for this statement as well.

A deviant act is an action or behavior that deviates from what is considered acceptable or normal by a particular society or culture. \"Normalization\" refers to the process by which a deviant act is accepted or integrated into a society or culture as a norm.\n\nStep 2: Now we will consider each of the options and determine which one aligns with the concept of \"normalization\".\n\n(A) recognised as breaking an important norm of behaviour - This option suggests that the deviant act is not accepted or normalized, but instead recognized as breaking a norm of behavior. This is not consistent with the concept of \"normalization.\"\n\n(B) seen a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character - This option suggests that the deviant act is not accepted or normalized, but rather seen as a temporary deviation from what is otherwise considered normal behavior for that person. This is not consistent with the concept of \"normalization.\"\n\n(C) the first step in establishing a deviant career - This option suggests that the deviant act is the first step in a pattern of behavior that establishes a deviant career. This is not consistent with the concept of \"normalization,\" as \"normalization\" refers to the process of integrating a deviant act into society or culture as a norm, rather than establishing a pattern of behavior.\n\n(D) attributed to the person's genetic or anatomical make up - This option suggests that the deviant act is attributed to the person's genetic or anatomical makeup. This is not consistent with the concept of \"normalization,\" as \"normalization\" refers to the process of integrating a deviant act into society or culture as a norm, rather than attributing the act to a person's genetic or anatomical makeup.\n\nStep 3: Based on the above analysis, the correct option is:\n\n(D) attributed to the person's genetic or anatomical makeup.
