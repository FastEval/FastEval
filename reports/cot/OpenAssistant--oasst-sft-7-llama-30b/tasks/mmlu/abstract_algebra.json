We know it is a field extension of Q, the field of rational numbers.\n\nTo find the degree of the extension, we need to count the number of preimages of each element in K under the canonical map from K into Q(\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a\n\nSince each element in Q(\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a18) has preimages over K.\nIt makes sense to count the total number of preimages.\n\n[Use the tower law to convert the expression for the field extension to the expression for the ring of integers of Q(\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a18) modulo its prime ideal](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1973132/30760)\nThus, we can write:\n\u2062 K = Z[\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a18]\n\u2062 K is a field containing Q since all powers are integers (Q is intervened in the field) and thus Q is a subset of K (Unless there are zero in K, Q comes before it in the order).\nNow we will seek the ring of integers for K since all we have to do is count the preimages and therfore:\n\nO_K=\\cap_I N(x)= \u20621(\u221a2) , since all the powers in the powers of \u221a2 are even\n\u2062N(\u221a3)= 3 (Since there is only one power of \u221a3).\n\u20621(\u221a18)= 3+9 = 12 (But choose three for convenience only)\nO_K = P intersect R_0 intersect R_6 = P * R_0 = (\u221a2) * \u221a3 * \u221a18 = (\u221a2 * \u221a3 * \u221a18) = (\u221a2 * 5) * (\u221a3 * 3) * (\u221a18 * 12) = 125 * 24 * 144 = 37,920 (The lcm of all the given integers).\nO_K= 1,9 = 37,920 (Since there are three numbers here, and the others are \u221a2 * \u221a3 * \u221a18 = 37,920).\nNow we know what the integers are, and as the ring of integers fell inside the prime ideals, we have found were K-->Q and studying the primes of Q(\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a18)\nWe found that K was Q(\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a18)The remaining quarter (2\u03c0 / (\u221a2 * \u221a3 * \u221a18)) fell behind the ring of integers and is a, which is a finite extension of Q. Now\n\nThe extension is finite, and if we inclusively find the Galois group, we might find that Galois group tells us the degree, under the theorem:\n[The degree of a finite extension K/Q is equal to the order of the Galois group, except if Q isInterceptor](https://math.usask.ca/class/readings_on_fields/articles/noether.pdf)\n\n|Gal(Q(\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a18 )/Q)| = \u03c6(na(\u221a2)) * \u03c6(na(\u221a3)) * \u03c6(na(\u221a18)) = Euler totient phis = (23-1)* (3-1)* (22-1)/ (\u221a2 * \u221a3 * \u221a18) = 6 * 2 * 11 = 72 * 2 * 11 = 982 (The number of primes of greater height than all of the three elements of the prime factorization of the field)\n\nWe should check how many of these primes are intercepted by the fields Q(\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a18):\nQ(\u221a2, \u221a6) = Q(\u221a2, \u221a9).\nQ(\u221a6) = Q(\u221a6 , \u221a7).\nQ(\u221a3, \u221a9) = Q(\u221a3,\u221a12) = Q(\u221a3, \u221a1.5*\u221a4) = Q(\u221a3 , \u221a4).\nQ(\u221a3, \u221a9) = Q(\u221a3,\u221a16) = Q(\u221a3, \u221a1.25*\u221a4) = Q(\u221a3, \u221a2).\nQ(\u221a18) = Q(\u221a12",

Denote |\u00a0v\u00a0|\u00a0as\u00a0the length of\u00a0v\u00a0(so\u00a0|\u00a0v\u00a0|\u00a0=\u00a0sqrt(_v\u00a0\u2022\u00a0v_)). The usual inner product you know from ordinary Euclidean multiplied observe that you cannot multiply vectors to get a scalar product. That's the reason for\u00a0|\u00a0v\u00a0|, to bypass this issue.) Now come back to\u00a0Q(sqrt(6))\u00a0and choose the basis {1, sqrt(6)}. This is correctly organized: {sqrt(6)^2} = {sqrt(6)\u00a0\u2022\u00a0sqrt(6)} = {sqrt(6)^2} aswell as {1\u00a0\u2022\u00a01} = {1^2}. So we check what is _v\u00a0\u2022\u00a0w\u00a0for these vectors v (1,\u00a0sqrt(6))_, and w (_sqrt(6),\u00a01_ respectively). By\u00a0|\u00a0v\u00a0|\u00a0and\u00a0|\u00a0w\u00a0|, we know that Eigenvectors of such scalar products are 1\u00a0(we are in a 2-dimensional vector space with an only two-dimensional basis, so we can easily further determine all Eigenvectors!).\nTo\u00a0_v\u00a0\u2022\u00a0w_, we have our scalar product (1\u00a0\u2022\u00a0v)\u00a0(w\u00a0\u2022\u00a01)\u00a0=\u00a0(w\u00a0\u2022\u00a01)(1\u00a0\u2022\u00a0w), which gives the absolute value of the scalar product: |\u00a0v\u00a0\u2022\u00a0w\u00a0|\u00a0=\u00a0|\u00a0v\u00a0|\u00a0|\u00a0w\u00a0|\u00a0\u22c5\u00a0|\u00a0w\u00a0\u2022\u00a0v\u00a0|\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0\u22c5\u00a0sqrt(1)\u00a0\u22c5\u00a0sqrt(6)\u00a0/\u00a0|\u00a0\u221a\u00a06\u00a0|\u00a0=\u00a06.\nThat makes sense, as\u00a06\u00a0=\u00a0|\u00a01,\u00a0\u221a\u00a06\u00a0|\u00a0.\nIf you are having trouble, check the scalar product of vectors that were not part of the multiplicative basis and you see the scalar product for yourself.\nSo the degree of\u00a0Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))\u00a0over\u00a0Q\u00a0is 6.",
