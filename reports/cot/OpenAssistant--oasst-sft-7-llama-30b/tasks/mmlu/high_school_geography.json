            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) a well-connected transportation infrastructure.\n\nExplanation:\nSubsistence economies refer to communities or regions that produce only enough goods and services to meet the basic needs of their residents, with little or no surplus to trade or invest in economic growth. There are several factors that can prevent subsistence economies from advancing economically.\n\n(A) A currency is not necessarily a prerequisite for economic development. Subsistence economies can barter goods and services without the use of a formal currency.\n\n(C) Government activity can actually play a role in promoting economic development in subsistence economies, through the provision of infrastructure, education, and healthcare.\n\n(D) A banking service is not a requirement for economic development in subsistence economies.\n\nThe main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically is the lack of a well-connected transportation infrastructure. Without transportation infrastructure, it is difficult for subsistence economies to access markets and trade goods, which is essential for economic growth. Additional factors such as limited access to education, healthcare, and technology also contribute to the prevention of economic advancement in subsistence economies.\n\nAnswer: (B) a well-connected transportation infrastructure.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) demographic momentum is the correct answer. \n\nExplanation:\n\nIn demographic momentum, a surplus of children that were born during the high fertility period is carried forward into adulthood, even after replacement fertility has been achieved. This surplus of children leads to a population continuing to grow for a period of time, even after fertility has become constant.\n\nThis is different from:\n\n(A) zero population growth. The term zero population growth refers to a situation where a population growth rate is exactly equal to zero. This means that the number of births in the population is equal to the number of deaths, and the population size does not increase or decrease.\n\n(B) rapid growth rate. A rapid growth rate refers to an exponential increase in the size of a population. This can happen when fertility is high and mortality is low.\n\n(C) homeostatic plateau. A homeostatic plateau refers to a situation where a population stabilizes after exponential growth. This can happen when the environment or resources become limiting.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Apologies, but I am still working on how to answer this question. Practice makes perfect!\n\nLet's work through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The question mentions \"migration,\" which refers to the movement of people from one location to another.\n2. The statement \"tendency for migration to decrease with distance\" suggests that as distance between a person's current location and a new location increases, the likelihood of that person migrating from their current location decreases.\n3. Now, let's consider the given options:\n\t* (A) \"push factors\" can refer to reasons or circumstances that compel people to leave their current location and move elsewhere, such as economic hardship or political instability.\n\t* (B) \"pull factors\" opposes (A) and refers to reasons or circumstances that attract people to move to a different location, such as better job opportunities or improved living conditions.\n\t* (C) \"distance decay\" suggests a decrease in a phenomenon or relationship as distance increases, which fits with the observation about migration.\n\t* (D) \"migration selectivity\" does not seem to relate to a general tendency for migration to decrease with distance.\n4. Based on the above analysis, the answer is:\n\n(C) distance decay.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand the concentric zone model of urban form proposed by Ernest Burgess. This model suggests that a city can be divided into five zones, which are arranged in a ring-like structure. These zones represent the changes in population density, land use, and social conditions from the city center to the periphery.\n\nThe first zone, which is the innermost, is the central business district (CBD). This area contains the city's tallest buildings, most active retail, and largest employment centers. The second zone is the transition zone, which contains low-income residential areas and industrial districts. The third zone is the working-class zone, where most of the city's population lives. This zone contains mostly single-family homes and smaller apartment buildings. The fourth zone is the area of least densely settled homes and gardens, and the fifth zone is theCommuter Zone Beyond the City Limits.\n\nBased on this pattern, we can see that the answer is (B) Second. This zone contains low-income residential areas and industrial districts, which are likely to include low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration.",

            "correct_answer": 2,

In the case of farm workers, they may migrate from one location to another to work during the growing season and then return home when the work is finished. This pattern of migration is commonly referred to as seasonal migration.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Circular migration.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Here are the steps to answer the question:\n\n1. Mediterranean climate may be an attractive environment for human habitation due to its moderate weather throughout the year. However, it is not necessarily a factor in early settlements along coastlines and rivers since humans have expanded their range to many different climates around the world.\n2. Limited forest cover may have facilitated settlements in certain areas by making space for agriculture, housing, and other human activities. However, it is not necessarily a factor in early settlements along coastlines and rivers, since areas with high population density are found in many different types of geography.\n3. Growth of manufacturing may be attractive for commerce in general, but it is not necessarily related to the early settlements along coastlines and rivers. Commerce has been conducted throughout history, even before the onset of modern manufacturing.\n4. Access to trade routes is the final answer. Early civilizations needed to access fresh water and trade routes in order to grow and prosper. Rivers and coastlines provided access to fresh water, transportation, and trade, which allowed the formation of settlements, and their growth through time.\n\nThe answer is (D) Access to trade routes.",
