The remaining amount of money will be $90 - $46.40 = $43.60. Since $43.60 is not a multiple of the cost of one soccer ball, we cannot buy any more soccer balls while remaining within the budget. Therefore, the answer must be (B) 5 soccer balls.\n\n(B) In order to buy 5 soccer balls, the team will pay $74.00 in total. The remaining amount of money will be $90 - $74.00 = $16.00. Because the remaining amount of money is not a multiple of the cost of one soccer ball, the team cannot buy any more soccer balls while remaining within the budget. Therefore, the answer must be (B) 5 soccer balls.\n\n(C) In order to buy 6 soccer balls, the team will pay $94.40 in total. The remaining amount of money will be $90 - $94.40 = -$4.40. Since we cannot subtract a negative quantity from the remaining amount, we cannot buy 6 balls. Therefore, the answer must be (A) 4 soccer balls.\n\n(D) In order to buy 7 soccer balls, the team will pay $106.00 in total. The remaining amount of money will be $90 - $106.00 = -$16.00.

In this case, we have 2.16 \u00f7 0.06, so we will find the divisor by multiplying the dividend by 10, which means we will end up with 2.16 \u00d7 10 = 21.6.\n2.
