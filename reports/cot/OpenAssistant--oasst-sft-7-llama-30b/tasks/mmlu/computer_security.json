            "model_answer": "If we look at the styles of fuzzers mentioned in the question, we can see that (A) Generational fuzzing is likely to be sample-efficient in code exploration, making it a possible answer. However, if we look at (B) Blackbox fuzzing, we can see that this style of fuzzer may have advantages in exploring paths for functions by conducting more systematic traversals, sample-efficient in code exploration, and yet many other cases where it appears to be more efficient than generational fuzzing apply, making it a possible answer. However, (C) Whitebox fuzzing is a more formidable opponent for this task, given that it sample-efficient in code exploration, making it a possible answer. However, if we look at (D) Mutation-based fuzzing, its ability to perform local mutations sample-efficient in code exploration, subjected to code structure and conduct its traversal tied to that, sample-efficient in code exploration, making it a possible answer.",

            "question": "Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don\u2019t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.\n2. An attacker impersonating the server.\n\n(A) True, True\n(B) False, False\n(C) True, False\n(D) False, True",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "understood understood \nAnswer: B. False, False\n\nReasoning:\nTLS provides confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity to the communication between the client and server. When a TLS connection is established successfully, the client and server both verify each other's identity through the use of digital certificates. If the client provides a client certificate, it allows the server to authenticate the client as well.\n\nIn this scenario, the client did not provide a client certificate, so the server authenticates the client based solely on its own certificate. This means that the server recognizes the client as a trusted entity, but the client does not know whether it is communicating with the genuine server, or with an imposter.\n\nTLS provides protection against the following attacks:\n\n- Replay Attacks: (A) True, True\n- Impersonation Attacks: (B) False, False\n- Tampering Attacks: (C) True, False\n- Information Disclosure Attacks: (D) False, True\n\nDuring a Replay Attack, a malicious actor intercepts and resends messages between the client and server. This can cause a denial of service or other types of attacks, but TLS protects against Replay Attacks by providing a message sequence number and using a timer to track message sequence numbers. This way a malicious actor cannot resend an entire message without the authentication and message number being detectable.\n\nTLS protects against Information Disclosure Attacks by providing encryption, which means a malicious actor cannot listen in on the communication between the client and server.\n\nLastly, Tampering Attacks occur when a malicious actor alters, adds, or removes a message in transit. TLS provides protection against Tampering Attacks by using Message Authentication Codes (MACs) and digital signatures to verify message integrity.\n\nLastly, in understood  understood  Answer: B.

What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",

When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.

If there are no string boundary checks, attackers can add or modify strings in the input and create buffer overflows.\n2. External memory storage with no checks: C and C++ languages do not make many checks on external memory storage, which can lead to buffer overflow when a hacker sends an excessive amount of data to the buffer or a string.\n3. No processing power checks for variable types: In C and C++ languages, developers may not have proper checks for variable types, which might allow attackers to trick the system by manipulating variable types and potentially leading to buffer overflow.\n4.

            "model_answer": "To answer the question, we need to understand the concept of a \"man in the middle\" attack and how it can affect the security of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method.\n\nA man in the middle attack occurs when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties to steal or tamper with the data being exchanged. In the context of the Diffie-Hellman method, if two parties are using this method to exchange a secret key, a man in the middle attack can be used to intercept and manipulate the key exchange process to steal the secret key.\n\nTo prevent such attacks, it is important for the two parties to authenticate each other before exchanging the secret key. This ensures that both parties are who they claim to be and that the key exchange process is secure.\n\nOption (B) Authenticated, is the correct answer. By authenticating each other, both parties can establish the identity of the other party and verify that it is not a man in the middle attacker. This helps to protect the security of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method.\n\nAnswer: (B) Authenticated",
