            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(A) ADF is a single equation approach to unit root testing while PP is a systems approach.\n\nExplanation: The Dickey-Fuller (DF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) approaches are different in their methodology for testing the presence of a unit root. The DF approach involves fitting a simple time series regression, with the dependent variable being the real logarithm of a variable of interest, and the independent variable being time. The null hypothesis is that the lagged value of the time series is non-zero and a unit root exists. The PP approach, on the other hand, involves estimating a range of linear regressions, with the dependent variable similar to that in the DF approach. The null hypothesis is that parameters in the regression equations similar to that in the DF range range over time. Therefore, PP involves fitting a similar time series regression, with the range range over time. Therefore, PP involves fitting a similar time series regression, with the range range over time. Therefore, PP involves fitting a similar time series regression, with the range range over time. Therefore, PP involves fitting a similar time series regression, with the range range over time. Therefore, PP involves fitting a similar time series regression, with the range range over time. Therefore, PP involves fitting a similar time series regression, with the range range over time.\n\n(B) PP tests reverse the DF null and alternative hypotheses so that there is stationarity under the null hypothesis of the PP test.\n\nExplanation: The PP approach explicitly tests for time-variation in both parameters and error terms, whereas the DF approach focuses on the error term. The PP test explicitly tests for time-variation in both parameters and error terms. Therefore, PP reverses the null hypothesis of the DF test and a stationary process is actually the null hypothesis under the PP test. Therefore, in PP stationarity is actually the null hypothesis under the PP test. Therefore, in PP stationarity is actually the null hypothesis under the PP test.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what the leverage effect means in financial practice and what it implies in terms of the news impact curve.\n\nThe leverage effect refers to the tendency of stock prices to increase or decrease by a larger percentage in response to positive or negative news than what would otherwise be expected, given their historical volatility. In other words, the impact of news on stock prices is magnified by the level of leverage in the market.\n\nNow, let's consider how this would affect the shape of the news impact curve:\n\n(A) If there were a leverage effect in practice, the news impact curve would rise more quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude. This is because negative news tends to trigger more selling and lead to a faster decline in stock prices than positive news, which leads to a faster rise in stock prices.\n\n(B) As the leverage effect magnifies the impact of news on stock prices, the news impact curve would not be symmetrical about zero. In other words, it's likelier that the curve would be either positively or negatively skewed, rather than symmetric.\n\n(C) The leverage effect wouldn't lead to a rise less quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude. It would have the opposite effect: the leverage effect would make the news impact curve rise more quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude. This is because the leverage effect amplifies the impact of negative news, which tends to trigger more selling and lead to a faster decline in stock prices.\n\n(D) The leverage effect wouldn't result in a news impact curve that is zero for all positive disturbances. While in some cases, positive news might have a smaller impact on stock prices than negative news, there are still cases where positive news can have a significant impact. For example, when a company reports strong earnings, it can lead to a significant rise in stock prices.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answers are A and B.\n\nExplanation:\n\n(A) The Box-Pierce Q statistic and the Ljung-Box Q* statistics are both used to test for linear dependence in time series, but they are calculated differently. When the sample size is large, both statistics tend to converge to each other. When the sample size is small, the values of the two test statistics may differ.\n\n(B) The Ljung-Box Q* statistic is usually considered to be more robust or reliable than the Q statistic when the sample size is small, since it tends to have a higher power to detect the presence of autocorrelation. This is because the Q statistics are sensitive to errors in the estimates of autocorrelation coefficients, while the Q* statistics are less sensitive to errors.\n\n(C) Option (C) is not entirely correct. When the sample size is small, both the Q and Q* statistics may be under- or over-sized, depending on the specific model and assumptions being tested. It is possible for both the Q and Q* statistics to be over-sized for small samples.\n\n(D) As the sample size tends towards infinity, both the Q and Q* tests will tend to show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients, because the errors in the estimates of autocorrelation coefficients tend to become smaller as the sample size increases.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",

In the context of model building, a parsimonious model is one that uses only the minimum number of variables necessary to explain the data. This means that the model includes only the variables that are truly important and relevant to the underlying phenomenon being studied, and excludes any variables that do not significantly contribute to the explanation of the data.\n\nIn building a parsimonious model, the goal is to achieve the best possible fit with the data while using the fewest possible variables. This requires careful consideration of which variables are most important and which can be safely excluded from the model. By using only the variables that are most important, a parsimonious model is both more elegant and easier to understand than a model that includes many unnecessary variables.\n\nA parsimonious model is often preferred over a more complex model because it is generally easier to interpret and has better predictive power.
