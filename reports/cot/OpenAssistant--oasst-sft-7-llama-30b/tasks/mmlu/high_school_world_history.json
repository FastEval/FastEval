By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . .

The fact that the Ghanians kept horses in their court does not necessarily indicate trade with the Mongols. Muslims could have simply brought over their practices from their native lands.\n\n(B) There is no evidence in the passage that the Ghanians adopted the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow. The description of the way people greeted the king in Ghana mentions that people of the same religion as the king would fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, while Muslims would greet him by clapping their hands, so the Ghanians may have had their own unique way of greeting the king.\n\n(C) The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, but from where specifically is not mentioned in the passage.

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race \u2014 by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\nThe Cawnpore massacre, as described by the first passage, was carried out by Indian soldiers who killed white individuals (both men and women) and children, as well as women and children of Indian origin. The British journalist Russell describes the massacre as a \"peculiar aggravation\" due to the fact that Indian subjects, who were subordinates to the British, had committed such brutal acts. The peculiarity arises from the fact that the murderers had different backgrounds compared to the victims. The discrimination by the British was not only racial but also by status and national origin. The Indian rulers exclusively enjoyed the power of violence, which was reflected in the dominance of the British over the Indians. In revolt, indigenous violence appeared. The British violated the principle of equality in a rush for power, just like in every other society. The British viewpoint is seen from the dispatches.\n\nThe second passage discusses the general system of British governance in India and contributes to the above analysis. The Britishers believed that the Indians were inferior to them, both in terms of war and in terms of their perceived humanness. Their racism and arrogance misled them into the impunity of superiority, leading to a violent seizure of the colonies. Meanwhile, the British in India suffered a defeat by viewing upon them not only national rebellion, which is the natural outcome of an arbitrary, unaccountable, and long-standing imperialism, but the discourse of the revolt as what their nineteenth-century minds perceived as \"mutiny.\" The British were uneasy with the acts of the mutiny and revolt, which opened a new vigor. Considering the barbarity of the nascent revolution, the dispatches went beyond the horror of the foreign rulers. The mutiny was a revolution not only in ideas and in the use of force against the British, but also in the minds of societies and, most importantly, in the minds of societies and nations. Both dispatches and articles abroad contributed to the madness of the revolutionary events. This violence must be considered as a response to that. Our post war with the North West Frontier Provencial Government and our inability to reconquer it from the abundance of rations may have somewhat accelerato(?) the movement, but all dispatches writing, extolling the martial qualities of the 34th, 54th, and 42nd Regiments, nave deluded us into a false sense, feeling that we could connive at insubordination, which subsequent correspondence has made public, on various pretexts. Finally, taking all these political sentences into account, it is plain that in Burmese societies, too, ravages have been going on. If nothing, then our actions and statements regarding Gorkhas in the Punjab have necessarily sparked these catastrophes. Europeans are not a unit by the character of their color, and Crutchley's ride on February 19th was but a searching for loot and the hunting of men. \n\nBoth the dispatches and articles abroad contribute to the madness of the revolutionary events.
