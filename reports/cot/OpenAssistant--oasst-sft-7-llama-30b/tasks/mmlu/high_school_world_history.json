By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away.

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",

The massacres involved the murder of a majority of British civilians, including women and children, by Indian troops who revolted against their British commanders.\n3. The use of violence in such a manner was a significant aspect of the British presence in India, with the authorities maintaining an exclusive monopoly on violence.\n4. The revolt of 1857 challenged this monopoly by matching British violence with indigenous violence.\n5. The British considered themselves superior to the Indians because of their birth and possession of a \"civilized\" culture. This was reinforced by treating Indians as sub-human, with even political rights being granted to them only as a charity or grace.\n6. According to the first passage, the massacres were carried out by \"black men\" who endeavored to re-establish their native leaders and religions, but the second passage does not contradict this.\n7. The question does not ask whether the massacre was justifiable according to local military custom, whether it resulted from the systemic brute force with which the British governed India, or whether it should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n8. Instead, the question asks whether the massacre was the result of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\n9. While there is no evidence presented in either passage that the massacre was the product of an organized and long-premeditated conspiracy, the lack of information on this point means that a definitive answer cannot be provided.\n10.
