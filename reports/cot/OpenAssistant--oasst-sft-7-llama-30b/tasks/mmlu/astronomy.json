This process is called Rayleigh scattering.\n\nDifferent wavelengths of light are scattered differently depending on their frequency. Short wavelength light such as blue, violet and ultraviolet are scattered more than longer wavelength light such as red and orange. Because blue light is scattered more than other colors, the sky appears blue to us.\n\n Answer: (C) Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.",

This involves making observations and gathering evidence to support or refute the hypothesis. In this case, the hypothesis states that there is an attractive force between all objects.\n\nTo test this theory, the first step would be to conduct a series of experiments. These experiments could involve dropping different objects and measuring how they move, such as dropping a bowling ball and observing it fall to the ground.\n\n(A) The first time you drop a bowling ball and it falls to the ground proving your hypothesis is not correct, as a single experiment is not enough to prove a hypothesis.\n\n(B) After you\u2019ve repeated your experiment many times is not enough to prove a hypothesis, as the results may be inconsistent or influenced by multiple factors.\n\n(C) You can never prove your theory to be correct only \u201cyet to be proven wrong\u201d is correct, as it is not possible to prove a hypothesis with absolute certainty.\n\n(D) When you and many others have tested the hypothesis and consistently observe the same results is correct, as widespread replication of experiments can provide strong evidence in support of a hypothesis.\n\nOverall, it is important to conduct multiple experiments and gather evidence over a long period of time before concluding that a hypothesis is correct or incorrect.",

The comet's impact speed is equivalent to its escape velocity, which is equal to the square root of 2 times the kinetic energy required to raise the comet's mass from the Earth's surface to its original height in the absence of air resistance. The kinetic energy required is the negative of the potential energy at the earth's surface, or:\n\nk = 2*times m*g*h\n\nwhere k is the kinetic energy, m is the comet's mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity and h is the original height of the comet.\n\n1. The acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface is given by:\n\ng = GM/R^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the Earth's mass and R is the Earth's radius.\n\n1. Substituting this expression for g into the kinetic energy equation, we get:\n\nk = 2*times m*times (2*pi*R^2/R^2)*height\n\nwhere the product (2*pi*R^2/R^2)*height is the acceleration due to gravity at the comet's original height.\n\n1.
