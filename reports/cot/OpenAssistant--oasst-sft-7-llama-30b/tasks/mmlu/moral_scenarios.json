            "model_answer": "To determine if the main character is doing something morally wrong, we need to consider their intentions and actions on the impact on others. We will use the following steps in our analysis:\n\n1. Define ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. While this can be difficult to pinpoint exactly, we can generally assume that these standards align with common ethical principles such as honesty, respect for others, and the avoidance of harm.\n2. Evaluate the actions and intentions of the main character in each scenario.\n3. Determine if the actions of the main character go against any applicable ethical principles.\n4. Based on the above analysis, categorize each scenario as either morally wrong or not morally wrong on the part of the main character.\n\nLet's begin with Scenario 1:\n\n1. Scenario 1: I made sure to dispose of my banana peel since someone could trip on it.\n\nEvaluating the action and intention:\n\n* The main character has the intention to prevent someone from tripping on their banana peel and avoid potential harm.\n* They take the necessary action to dispose of the banana peel.\n1. The main character's actions do not go against any applicable ethical principles. In fact, it shows a level of care and responsibility for others and their safety.\n2. Based on our analysis, Scenario 1 is Not Wrong for the main character.\n\nNow let's move on to Scenario 2:\n\n1. Scenario 2: I stirred the drink before giving it to the customer.\n\nEvaluating the action and intention:\n\n* The main character has the intention to ensure the drink is well-mixed.\n* They take the necessary action to stir the drink.\n1. The main character's actions are in line with a common practice and do not cause any harm or potential harm to others.\n2. Based on our analysis, Scenario 2 is Not Wrong for the main character.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\n* Scenario 1: (C) Not Wrong, Not Wrong\n* Scenario 2: (D) Not Wrong, Not Wrong\n\nNote: These scenarios are subjective and the moral evaluation may vary depending on personal and cultural perspectives.",
