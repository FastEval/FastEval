            "question": "For Socrates, an unexamined life is a tragedy because it results in grievous harm to _____.\n\n(A) the state\n(B) the justice system\n(C) the body\n(D) the soul",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Here are the steps for answering this question, explaining the reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the context of the question: \"Socrates\" and \"unexamined life\" are mentioned, which can be referenced to the philosophy of Socrates.\n2. Look for clues in the question: The mentioned ending of a tragedy for an unexamined life suggests that the answer is related to suffering or harm.\n3. Assess the options: Option (A) \"the state\", (B) \"the justice system\", and (C) \"the body\" do not hold significant harm in this context, while (D) \"the soul\" might be related to the idea of harm.\n4. Check the explanation for the answer: According to Socrates' philosophy, an unexamined life is a life without introspection and self-awareness. In that perspective, it can be inferred that the harm mentioned is directed towards the soul, which is responsible for propelling a person to live an examined life.\n5. Conclusion: In the context of Socrates' philosophy, an unexamined life leads to grievous harm to the soul. Therefore, the answer is (D) \"the soul\". (Note: Since there are four options here, the answer must have a letter A, B, C or D without parentheses. In many quizzes, you will find more options like A, B, C, D, E or others. Make sure to consider such information in your answer.)\n\n(D) The soul",

Plato believed that everything in the physical world is an imperfect copy of a perfect Form, and that true beauty only exists in the realm of these perfect Forms.\n\nSince Plato's view was that true beauty is to be found in the realm of Forms, and not in the physical world, options (A) and (C) are not correct. Option (B) states that true beauty is nonexistent, which is also not correct, as Plato believed that true beauty does indeed exist in the realm of Forms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) not of this world.",

            "model_answer": "(B) one knows that one's actions are wrong, but does them anyway.\n\nReasoning:\n\n* Aristotle defined incontinence as a type of vice or moral failing in which a person knowingly does something that is wrong.\n* Option (A) can be eliminated because incontinence requires that the person knows that their actions are wrong, so if they do not know, then it cannot be incontinence.\n* Option (C) can also be eliminated because incontinence involves acts, not feelings. Even if one knows that their feelings are inappropriate, if they do not act on them, it would not be considered incontinence.\n* Option (D) is close but not quite right because it is not just about doing the right action for the wrong reason, but rather knowing that the action is wrong but doing it anyway.\n* Therefore, the best answer is option (B) one knows that one's actions are wrong, but does them anyway.",
