            "question": "One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\n(B) admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\n(C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n(D) inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",

            "model_answer": "This scenario presents several legal questions, including issues of negligence and confidentiality. Based on the information provided, the most relevant component of the scenario is whether the testimony of the consulting attorney is admissible in court.\n\nTo answer this question, we must examine the scope and application of the attorney-client privilege. Specifically, we must consider whether the consulting attorney can testify to confidential communications made by the plaintiff (the 9-year-old boy) to the attorney during a consultation where the boy's father was present.\n\nThe attorney-client privilege is a privilege that protects communications between an attorney and their client from disclosure. It is intended to encourage clients to communicate openly and honestly with their attorneys, allowing attorneys to provide the best representation possible.\n\nOne of the basic requirements for establishing an attorney-client privilege is that the communication must have been made with the expectation that it would be kept confidential. This requirement is typically satisfied when the communication is made in private, without any third parties present.\n\nIn this scenario, however, the boy and his father visited the consulting attorney together. This means that the third party (the father) was present during the communication, which could potentially mean that the expectation of confidentiality was waived.\n\nOn this basis, the answer to the question would be (A): the attorney's testimony is admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.",

            "question": "A state statute provides: \"Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. \" Violation of the statute is made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found\n\n(A) not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(B) not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(C) guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n(D) guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.",

            "question": "A taxpayer was notified by the government that her individual income tax was underpaid by $1,012. 69. The taxpayer retained an attorney to represent her in contesting the assessment. During the preparation of his client's case, the attorney suggested that it might be a good idea if the taxpayer hired an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement for the year in question. Following the attorney's advice, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, who prepared a financial statement, which the attorney referred to at trial. During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testif' about statements that the taxpayer made to him. The accountant's proposed testimony is\n\n(A) inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n(B) inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.\n(C) inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.\n(D) admissible as an admission.",

An attorney-client privilege exists \"between a cloud of clients when made for the purpose of securing the representation of the person confiding or consulting the communication.\" The privilege can be called to prevent the communication being disclosed by the customer or the recipient. 2. There is an exception to the attorney-client privilege, but statements made by the client to an accountant for their evaluation relied on in the representation are privileged. 3. Since the taxpayer had retained a lawyer, and also consulted an accountant, the taxpayer did not have to testify as a subject. 4. The attorney--accountant--taxpayer relationship is subject to the exception to the attorney-client privilege. Thus, unless the taxpayer consents, the accountant's proposed testimony would be inadmissible.",

            "question": "A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order\n\n(A) valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\n(B) valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\n(C) invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\n(D) invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.",

            "model_answer": "A warrantless search exception allows law enforcement to search for items that are evidence of a crime without obtaining a warrant. There are a few common warrantless search exceptions that courts recognize as reasonable under certain circumstances.\n\nTo answer this question, we can start by considering what the general requirement is for a lawful search. The 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution generally requires that searches must be supported by a warrant, which must be based on \"probable cause\" to believe that evidence of a crime will be found. However, there are some exceptions to this requirement, which courts have recognized as reasonable under certain circumstances.\n\n(A) Cold pursuit involves continuing the pursuit of a suspect from one jurisdiction into another. This search exception is based on the notion that the suspect's 4th Amendment protections can be temporarily suspended during the pursuit in order to allow law enforcement to maintain contact and prevent the suspect from escaping.\n\n(B) Incident to a lawful arrest allows law enforcement to search the person being arrested and their immediate surroundings for weapons or further evidence of a crime in order to ensure officer safety and prevent the destruction or loss of evidence.\n\n(C) Plain view involves discovering evidence that is in plain view, meaning that it can be seen by the naked eye from a legal vantage point. This exception allows law enforcement to seize evidence that is plainly visible and in plain view.\n\n(D) Stop and frisk involves stopping a person lawfully and frisking them for weapons based on reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous. This search exception is based on the notion that it is reasonable to search for weapons when there is a legitimate concern for officer safety and the possibility of a crime being committed.\n\n(A), (B), (C), (D).",

If the shopper asserts a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort, the plaintiff will\n\n(A) prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.\n(B) prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.\n(C) not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n(D) not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.",

It is important to determine whether the problem lies with the mirror itself or with the brackets used to hang the mirror.
