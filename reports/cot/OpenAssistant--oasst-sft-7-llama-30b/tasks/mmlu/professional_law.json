            "question": "One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\n(B) admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\n(C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n(D) inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Answer: (C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n\nReasoning:\n\n* The attorney-client privilege is a legal privilege that allows confidential communications between a client and an attorney to be kept secret and protected from disclosure.\n* In this situation, the boy and his father visited the attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case.\n* The attorney-client privilege applies to communications made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.\n* Since the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit, the communication may not have been made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.\n* Therefore, the attorney's testimony would be inadmissible, because it would breach the confidentiality of the communication between the attorney and the client.",

            "question": "A state statute provides: \"Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. \" Violation of the statute is made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found\n\n(A) not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(B) not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(C) guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n(D) guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.",

            "model_answer": "This case raises the question of whether the suspect's use of force was justified. The statute requires that a person should not use force or any weapon in resisting arrest. However, the facts presented suggest that the police officer may have unlawfully used his nightstick and the jury is being asked to determine whether the suspect's response was justified.\n\nTo find the answer, we should look at the relevant legal precedent. Based on the facts presented, it is unclear whether the arrest was lawful. If the jury believes the suspect's account and the arrest was unlawful, then the suspect should be found not guilty. However, if the jury believes the police officer's account and the arrest was lawful, then the suspect should be found guilty (D).",

            "question": "A taxpayer was notified by the government that her individual income tax was underpaid by $1,012. 69. The taxpayer retained an attorney to represent her in contesting the assessment. During the preparation of his client's case, the attorney suggested that it might be a good idea if the taxpayer hired an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement for the year in question. Following the attorney's advice, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, who prepared a financial statement, which the attorney referred to at trial. During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testif' about statements that the taxpayer made to him. The accountant's proposed testimony is\n\n(A) inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n(B) inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.\n(C) inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.\n(D) admissible as an admission.",

            "question": "A defendant was angry at his friend for marrying the defendant's former girlfriend. As the friend was painting his house one afternoon, the defendant fired a shot from his gun at him. Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter. The defendant is subsequently charged with the first-degree murder of the daughter. The relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are as follows:Section 169: Murder in the first degree is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170: Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. Which of the following, if established, would provide the defendant with his best defense?\n\n(A) He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.\n(B) He intended only to wound the friend.\n(C) He was unaware of the elements of malice.\n(D) The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(B) He intended only to wound the friend.\n\nBased on the statutes provided, first-degree murder requires an unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought, which means with a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. If the defendant can establish that he only intended to wound his friend and not kill him or the daughter, this could serve as a defense against a first-degree murder charge.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is the best defense for the defendant.\n\nHowever, if the defendant intended to kill his friend and not the daughter, that could still be considered as murder, even if it is not a first-degree murder. In this case, the defendant would need to look at other defenses, such as self-defense or provocation, which can reduce the charges from first-degree murder to a lesser offense.\n\nIn any case, if the defendant intended to kill the daughter, or if the killing was a result of reckless conduct, the defendant may not have a strong defense.",

            "model_answer": "A confession is considered inadmissible if one of the following conditions is met:\n\n(A) The defendant's statement was involuntary. For a confession to be considered voluntary, the defendant must have made it without any external pressures or coercive measures taken by law enforcement officials. In other words, the statement must have been made freely and voluntarily, with a full understanding of the accused's rights and the consequences of their actions.\n(B) The defendant's statement was voluntary. A confession is considered admissible if it was made voluntarily, meaning that the defendant was not pressured or coerced into making the statement. The statement must have been made with a full understanding of the accused's rights and the consequences of their actions.\n(C) The defendant was not in custody when the statement was made. A confession made by a person who was not in custody, meaning that they were not deprived of their freedom in any way, would be considered admissible. In other words, the person must have been free to come and go as they pleased at the time of the statement.\n(C) The statement was not made in response to a known police interrogation. A confession made in response to a known police interrogation, meaning that the person was questioned by law enforcement officials about a crime, would be considered inadmissible. This is because police interrogations can be very intimidating and coercive, making it difficult for a defendant to make a voluntary statement.\n\nThe answer is (D) The statement was not made in response to a known police interrogation.",

            "question": "A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order\n\n(A) valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\n(B) valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\n(C) invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\n(D) invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.",

            "model_answer": "A) Cold pursuit: I chose option A, Cold pursuit, because it is not a specific warrantless search exception recognized by the United States Supreme Court. Warrantless searches are generally subject to the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, which requires that searches be reasonable and supported by probable cause. Some exceptions to the warrant requirement have been recognized by the Court, such as search incident to a lawful arrest, plain view, and stop and frisk, which are also listed as options.\nB) Incident to a lawful arrest: I did not choose option B, Incident to a lawful arrest, because it is a recognized warrantless search exception. A search incident to a lawful arrest is the search of the person arrested and the area within their immediate physical control. There are certain exceptions to this exception, such as a search occurring outside of the scope of the arrest or if the arrestee is not present.\nC) Plain view: I did not choose option C, Plain view, because it is a recognized warrantless search exception. A plain view search occurs when the government observes contraband in plain view from a location in which the government has the right to be.\nD) Stop and frisk: I chose option A, Cold pursuit, because it is not a specific warrantless search exception recognized by the United States Supreme Court.

A few days after the carpenter installed the mirror, the mirror suddenly fell from the wall because of a defect in the brackets. It struck a shopper on the head, causing serious injuries to him. If the shopper asserts a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort, the plaintiff will\n\n(A) prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.\n(B) prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.\n(C) not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n(D) not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Answer: A.\n\nReasoning: The key element of strict liability in tort is that the defendant must be in control of something that has the potential to cause harm to others. In this case, the manufacturer provided defective brackets and bolts that the carpenter used to hang the mirror. The carpenter was paid to install the mirror, so he was in control of the process and the installation. Therefore, it can be argued that the carpenter has the control over the mirror installation, making him strictly liable for the defects of the brackets and the resulting harm caused to the shopper.\n\nNote: This answer assumes that there is no other relevant information about the case.

The man and his purported second wife bought a home together as tenants by the entirety.

The trial court awarded the property to the estate. The man appealed from his prison cell. Under the common law, will the appellate court affirm the trial court's decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home?\n\n(A) Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\n(B) Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\n(C) No, the court will as a policy matter recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common.\n(D) No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.",
