            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) 18 gauge.\n\nThere are several factors that need to be considered when selecting the appropriate size of cannula for a patient who needs a rapid blood transfusion. One of the most important factors is the intended rate of blood flow. In order to deliver blood as rapidly as possible, a larger cannula is typically required.\n\n18 gauge cannula is commonly used for rapid blood transfusion because it allows for a higher blood flow rate compared to smaller gauge cannula. This is due to the larger internal diameter of an 18 gauge cannula, which allows more blood to move through the cannula in a given amount of time.\n\nIn addition, an 18 gauge cannula is also easier to insert than smaller gauge cannula, which can be more difficult to insert quickly in an emergency situation.\n\nOverall, the 18 gauge cannula is the best choice for a patient who needs a rapid blood transfusion, as it allows for the most efficient and effective delivery of blood.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Answer: (B) The patient has a colostomy.\n\nReasoning:\n\n* Closed pouches are used in the management of patients who have undergone a colostomy, in which one end of the large intestine is brought to the surface of the abdomen to create a stoma (an opening) through which stool is excreted.\n* Closed pouches are designed to collect and contain the stool, allowing the patient to dispose of it in a private and hygienic manner.\n* The pouch is attached to the stoma with an adhesive and is usually reusable or disposable.\n* Closure of the pouch can be done either by fastening it with a clip or rolling it up and securing it with a bandage, and can be worn for several days before needing to be replaced.\n* Closed pouches are commonly used in patients with colostomies as they offer more freedom and convenience than an open pouch, which is filled and emptied more frequently.\n* The patient may shower or bathe without fear of leaks or odor.\n* The patient can also engage in physical activity without any discomfort or worry of pouch dislodgement.\n* The patient can use a wide range of pouching systems, including one- and two-piece systems, and pouching systems that allow for comfortable and discreet wear during physical activity.\n* It is also common for the medical professional to recommend irrigation in order to help reduce the risk of constipation, which is a common complication after a colostomy.\n* The success of an ileostomy depends on the patient's diet and lifestyle, and it may take some trial and error to determine what works best for each individual.\n\nAnswer: (B).",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Answer: D\n\nExplanation:\n\nDuring muscle contractions, the body uses energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to fuel the movement. ATP is generated through both anaerobic and aerobic metabolism. Anaerobic metabolism involves breaking down glucose without using oxygen, while aerobic metabolism involves using oxygen to break down glucose.\n\nWhen we engage in intense physical activity, such as sprinting, the body relies more on anaerobic metabolism to produce ATP. However, as we continue to sprint, the body must also use aerobic metabolism to generate ATP, in order to maintain the intensity and duration of the activity.\n\nTherefore, as the number of sprints increases, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism also increases, as the body needs to use both anaerobic and aerobic metabolism to generate ATP and fuel the muscle contractions. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because anaerobic contribution does not progressively increase, the pH of the muscle does not fall below 6.0, and blood glucose concentration does not fall below 3 mmol/L.",

Diplopia is the medical term for double vision, and it can be caused by a variety of factors.\n\nOption (A) states that diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered. This is not necessarily true, as diplopia can still occur if one eye is covered if the underlying cause is related to the structure of the eye or the brain.\n\nOption (B) states that the outer image is always the false image. This is not always true, as the false image can occur in different positions depending on the cause of the diplopia.\n\nOption (C) states that a fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards. This is not always true, as a fourth nerve palsy can also occur when the patient looks downwards.\n\nOption (D) states that a sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint. This is not always true, as a sixth nerve palsy can also cause a convergent squint.\n\nBased on this information, the answer to the question is:\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint.\n\nThis is not always the case, but it is one of the possible causes of diplopia.",

The first step in this process is the attachment of the fatty acid to CoA, which converts it into acyl-CoA, a more water-soluble molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) coenzyme A (CoA).",
