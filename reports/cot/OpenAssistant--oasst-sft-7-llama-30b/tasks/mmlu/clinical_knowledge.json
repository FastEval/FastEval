Each option contains a statement about diplopia, which is the condition in which a single object is perceived as two in an individual with normal binocular vision.\n\n(A) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered - This is incorrect. Diplopia can occur in an individual with normal binocular vision if one eye is covered or if both eyes are open and the individual is experiencing diplopia.\n\n(B) The outer image is always the false image - It depends on the cause of the diplopia. The outer image may be the false image in some cases, such as with a fourth nerve palsy, but not in all cases.\n\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards - This is incorrect. A fourth nerve palsy can occur with any upward gaze, including looking upwards, downwards, or laterally.\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint - This is incorrect.

While sodium bicarbonate ingestion does increase the buffering capacity of the blood by increasing HCO3- concentration, it does not directly raise pH in the extracellular fluid in the muscles. The elevated pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid by sodium bicarbonate would lead to a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle. This effect would lead to increased performance.\n\nAnswer: A (elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle).",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Steps to answer the question:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the context and the relevant details related to fatty acids and their transport into mitochondria.\n2. In cells, fatty acids are a primary source of energy. However, due to their structure, they cannot directly enter the mitochondria, which are the main organelles responsible for producing ATP, a form of energy.\n3. Therefore, fatty acids need to be modified to allow their entry into mitochondria. This modification involves attaching them to specific molecules, which act as carriers for fatty acids.\n4. Thiokinase converts fatty acids into thioesters, which are more easily bonded to Coenzyme A (CoA). This step is crucial for fatty acids to undergo oxidative phosphorylation (the process by which fatty acids are broken down to produce ATP).\n5. Coenzyme A allows fatty acids bonded to it to enter the mitochondria.\n6. Acetyl-CoA is a metabolite that plays a role in the metabolism of fatty acids. It is not a carrier for fatty acids.\n7. Carnitine is an essential amino acid that plays a role in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria. It facilitates the entry of fatty acids into the mitochondria by binding to them.\n8. Therefore, the answer to the question of which molecule acts as a carrier for fatty acids into mitochondria is (B) Coenzyme A (CoA).\n\nAnswer:\n(B) coenzyme A (CoA)",
