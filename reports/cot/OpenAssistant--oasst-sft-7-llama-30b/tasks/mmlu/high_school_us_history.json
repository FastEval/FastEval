            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Alright, here is my step-by-step reasoning for the answer to the question:\n\n1. The text mentions that the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" has no place in public education.\n2. It follows that the answer lies in initiatives that aimed to achieve equality in schools prior to the 1954 ruling in the Brown v. Board of Education case.\n3. The options listed include The Great Society, The Square Deal, The New Deal and Reconstruction.\n4. Let's start by eliminating The Great Society, as it is a 1960s initiative and therefore came after the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling.\n5. Now the answer must be among the remaining options: The Square Deal, The New Deal, and Reconstruction.\n6. Next, let's look at the specific promises being referred to in the text. The text mentions the need to fulfill promises made by previous initiatives related to educational equality.\n7. Eliminating Reconstruction based on the understanding that its main focus was on rebuilding the Southern states after the Civil War and that its policies around education were somewhat limited.\n8. Now it's a choice between The Square Deal and The New Deal.\n9. Reading more into the text, the emphasis shifts to an ongoing failure to address these promises. Therefore, the answer is likely an ongoing initiative. We know that The Square Deal ended after the death of President Theodore Roosevelt in 1919, therefore we rule it out.\n10. Both initiatives started by Teddy Roosevelt and both aimed to diminish social inequality in the US. However, The New Deal was more successful regarding racial discrimination than The Square Deal.\n11. So the correct answer is (C) The New Deal.\n\n(C) The New Deal",

Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth.

The text also notes that the \"Know-Nothings,\" a group of similar beliefs to the Ku-Klux Klan, berated the Irish and Germans as a menace to society.\n\nThe text highlights the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 as being closely related to legislation that is most closely an example of nativism, because it finds racial discrimination at its worst, a deliberate attempt to go back 84 years in our census taken every 10 years so that a blow may be aimed at peoples of eastern and southern Europe, particularly at our recent allies in the Great War\u2014Poland and Italy.\n\n(D) The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965\n\nHowever it's worth noting that the text also notes that the \"Know-Nothings\" berated the Irish and Germans as a menace to society, so they may also be considered nativism as well.
