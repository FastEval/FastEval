This means that all elements evaluated under (A)x, or all apartments, belong to the set Ax. Any properties stated under Ax pertain to all apartments.\n- Next is Lx: x is large. With Lx = \u221ax) we know that all spaces that belong to Lx are large.\n- Then we have [(Ax \u2022 Lx)]. As Ax stands for apartments and Lx stands for large spaces, any element (x) under this \"Ax \u2022 Lx\" is indeed a large apartment.\n- The sentences states (\u2203y)(Hy \u2022 Bxy). This means there exist some spaces y that are \"houses\" and we are comparing it to another property Bxy. This therefore looks for a large apartment T that is in fact larger than y. None of the options conveys that.
