            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The term I am looking for is \"satisficing\" (B).\n\nExplanation:\nDuring negotiations, parties often aim to achieve the best possible outcome. However, in some cases, the parties may come to a conclusion that is sub-optimal, but still acceptable to both parties. This term represents the outcome where the parties settle for something that is not the best possible outcome, but it still satisfies both parties.\n\nTo clarify further, if the parties are negotiating to divide a cake, the optimal outcome would be for both parties to get an equal share of the cake. However, if the parties do not agree on how to divide the cake, they might settle for a sub-optimal outcome, such as one party getting a slightly bigger share and the other getting a slightly smaller share. In this case, they come to a conclusion that is sub-optimal, but still acceptable to both parties, which represents the satisficing outcome.",

It proposes that managers have, at least, two basic assumptions about human nature that lead to their management style. One interpretation, considering two assumptions, is:\n\nAssuming that workers show little or no effort unless, and until, they have an external incentive, such as more money, we can find the answer to this question by investigating the premises of McGregor's Theory X and examining its implications.\nAssuming that workers are motivated only by the possibility of achieving some immediate satisfaction we can find the answer to this question by investigating the premises of McGregor's Theory X and examining its implications.\n\nAccording to this information, the answer can be assumed to be (D).",
