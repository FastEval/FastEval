            "question": "Maine's famous aphorism that 'the movement of progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract' is often misunderstood. In what way?\n\n(A) It is misinterpreted as a prediction.\n(B) His concept of status is misrepresented.\n(C) It is taken literally.\n(D) His idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Firstly, let's clarify what the aphorism means. Maine's aphorism states that \"the movement of progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract.\" This means that in the past, societies have shifted from being based on status to being based on contracts or agreements. In other words, societies have moved away from relying on traditional principles or birthrights to determine one's place in society, and towards relying on individual agreements or contracts to determine one's rights and responsibilities.\n\nNow, let's look at the given options and see how they relate to misunderstanding Maine's aphorism:\n\n(A) It is misinterpreted as a prediction. This option suggests that Maine's aphorism is sometimes misunderstood as a prediction of the future movement of societies, rather than a description of the past movement. However, this misunderstanding is not related to the two other misunderstandings mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\n(B) His concept of status is misrepresented. This option suggests that Maine's concept of status is sometimes misunderstood or misrepresented, which may affect our understanding of the movement away from status. However, this misunderstanding is not related to the two other misunderstandings mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\n(C) It is taken literally. This option suggests that Maine's aphorism is sometimes taken literally, which may lead to confusion or incorrect interpretations. For example, someone may interpret the aphorism as a complete and unchanging movement away from status towards contracts, which may not be the case. This misunderstanding is likely to cause confusion or incorrect interpretations.\n\n(D) His idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems. This option suggests that Maine's idea is sometimes considered inapplicable to Western legal systems, which may lead to incorrect interpretations or misunderstandings. For example, someone may consider the aphorism as irrelevant to Western legal systems, whic",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(A) Depression of the 1930s is unlikely to be a factor that contributed significantly to the revival of natural law in the 20th century. While the Depression did lead to economic and social turmoil, it is unlikely to have had a direct impact on the study of natural law.\n\n(B) The rise of Fascism is also unlikely to have contributed significantly to the revival of natural law in the 20th century. Fascism is based on totalitarian ideologies that are antithetical to the principles of natural law.\n\n(C) The international recognition of human rights after World War II is likely to have contributed significantly to the revival of natural law in the 20th century. The United Nations' Declaration of Human Rights and other international legal documents are based on the principles of natural law, and the recognition of human rights as universal principles helped to revive the study of natural law.\n\n(D) The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in 1917 is unlikely to have contributed significantly to the revival of natural law in the 20th century. While the Bolshevik Revolution did have a profound impact on the world, it is not clear how it could have led to a revival of natural law.",

            "model_answer": "(A) By denying its existence.\n\nMax Weber's book, \"Economy and Society,\" includes the chapter \"Bureaucracy.\" In this chapter, Weber explores the concept of bureaucracy and its role in modern society. He also addresses a problem that he calls the \"England problem,\" which refers to the ability of the English legal system to facilitate the development of capitalism despite its seemingly anti-capitalist nature.\n\nWeber's solution to the England problem is not to deny its existence but rather to address it head-on. He recognizes that the English legal system, with its emphasis on customary law and the precedent-based Common Law system, creates a unique environment for capitalism to develop. He argues that this system allows for the creation of stable, long-lasting institutions that can support economic growth and development.\n\n(B) By explaining the difference between the common law and civil law.\n\nWeber acknowledges that the English legal system is different from other legal systems, such as the civil law system found in Continental Europe. However, he does not simply explain the differences between the two systems. Instead, he argues that the common law system, with its emphasis on precedent and case law, allows for greater flexibility and adaptation to changing economic and social conditions. This, he contends, makes it better suited to support the development of capitalism than the more rigid and formal civil law system.\n\n(C) By distinguishing certain features of the English legal system that facilitated the development of capitalism.\n\nWeber does indeed distinguish certain features of the English legal system that facilitated the development of capitalism. He highlights, for example, the importance of stable, long-lasting institutions, as well as the flexibility and adaptability of the Common Law system. He also emphasizes the role of the judiciary in ensuring the impartiality and objectivity of the law, which is important for fostering confidence in the legal system.",
