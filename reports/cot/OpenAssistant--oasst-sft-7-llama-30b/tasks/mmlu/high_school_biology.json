(A)\n\nB) a deletion of a nucleotide triplet would also result in a premature stop codon and truncated protein, but may not always be as severe as A) due to the triplet nature of codons.\n\nC) a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the first codon position would also result in a premature stop codon and truncated protein, but may not always be as severe as A) or B) due to the degeneracy of the genetic code.\n\nD) a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the third codon position would not disrupt the reading frame and would not result in a premature stop codon, but could still potentially lead to a non-functional protein due to altered amino acid sequence.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) a deletion of a single nucleotide.",

Here's some information to help you:\n\n* Invertebrate: These are animals that don't have a backbone or spinal column. Some examples include insects, crustaceans, and mollusks.\n* Immune systems: These are systems that help animals defend against threats, such as bacteria and viruses. This can include physical barriers, chemicals, and specialized cells.\n* Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes: These are white blood cells that can directly attack and kill infected cells, such as those infected with viruses.\n* Phagocytes: These are white blood cells that can engulf and digest harmful substances, such as contaminants and pathogens, that can harm the body. Some examples include neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages.\n* B-cells: These are white blood cells that can produce antibodies, which are special proteins that can recognize and attack specific pathogens, such as bacteria or viruses.\n* Helper T-cells: These are white blood cells that help activate and coordinate other immune cells, such as phagocytes and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.\n\nBased on this information, we can answer the question as follows:\n\n(B) Phagocytes: Phagocytes can be found in many types of invertebrates, including insects, crustaceans, and mollusks. They help to protect the body from external threats by engulfing and digesting pathogens and other harmful substances.\n\nHere is the answer, as requested:\n\nAnswer: (B) Phagocytes",
