            "question": "You are told that the cross-price elasticity between goods X and Y is +2.0. This means that\n\n(A) goods X and Y are normal goods.\n(B) goods X and Y are inferior goods.\n(C) goods X and Y are complementary goods.\n(D) goods X and Y are substitute goods.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) goods X and Y are substitute goods.\n\nExplanation:\nThe cross-price elasticity of demand measures the change in the quantity demanded of a good in response to a change in the price of a related good. If the cross-price elasticity of demand is positive (i.e., the cross-price elasticity between goods X and Y is +2.0), it means that the two goods are substitute goods. When the price of good Y rises, it increases the price of the substitute good, which is good X. As a result, people tend to consume more of good X (as it is relatively cheaper) and less of good Y. Therefore, the cross-price elasticity is positive.\n\n(A) goods X and Y are normal goods.\nExplanation: If two goods are substitute goods, it does not mean that they must be normal goods. Normal goods are goods where the lowest income consumer will consume the smallest amount. As the income increases, the quantity of normal goods will increase. In other words, they are normal goods.

Workers who invest time and money in their education and skill development will generally be more valuable in the labor market and will therefore be able to command a higher wage.\n4.
