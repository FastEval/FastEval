            "model_answer": "We can determine the nature of goods X and Y using the information provided.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what cross-price elasticity of demand is. Cross-price elasticity measures the change in demand for one good in response to a change in the price of another good. The value of cross-price elasticity is either positive, negative or zero.\n\nNext, consider the given value: cross-price elasticity of goods X and Y is +2.0. This means that if the price of good Y increases, the demand for good X will increase by 2 units for every 1 unit increase in the price of Y.\n\nWe need to look at the definition of rival goods to determine the nature of goods X and Y:\n\n* Two goods are considered complementary goods if an increase in the price of one good leads to an increase in demand for the other good.\n* Two goods are considered substitute goods if an increase in the price of one good leads to a decrease in demand for the other good.\n\nSince cross-price elasticity of goods X and Y is positive, they are either complementary goods or substitute goods. Since the value of cross-price elasticity is positive, we can exclude the possibility of inferior goods.\n\nTherefore, goods X and Y are either complementary goods or substitute goods.\n\nAnswer: (C) goods X and Y are complementary goods.",

            "question": "An externality\n\n(A) causes the equilibrium price to be artificially high\n(B) causes the equilibrium price to be artificially low\n(C) exists when markets cannot reach equilibrium\n(D) results in an equilibrium that does not maximize the total benefit to society",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is B, as the definition of an externality is that it causes the equilibrium price to be artificially low.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAn externality is a cost or benefit that is not included in the price of a good or service, and is therefore not factored into the demand or supply of the product. This can lead to market inefficiencies, as the price of a product or service does not reflect its true economic cost or benefit.\n\nThere are two types of externalities: positive externalities and negative externalities. A positive externality occurs when the production or consumption of a good or service benefits others, but the cost of these benefits is not reflected in the price. For example, education is a positive externality, as it can benefit society as a whole by increasing the productivity of those who receive an education, even though the cost of providing education is not fully paid for by the individuals who receive it.\n\nOn the other hand, a negative externality occurs when the production or consumption of a good or service imposes costs on others that are not reflected in the price. For example, air pollution is a negative externality of producing and burning fossil fuels, as it can harm the health of those who breathe the polluted air, even though the cost of the pollution is not borne by the producers or consumers of fossil fuels.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the given statements is not a basis for a wage differential, we need to consider why wage differentials exist.\n\nWage differentials are differences in the payment received by individuals in the labor market for performing different jobs or working for different employers. There are several reasons why wage differentials may exist:\n\n1. Risk: Some jobs may be considered riskier or more hazardous than others. For example, firefighters may be paid more than office workers because there is a higher risk of injury or death associated with their job.\n2. Skill level: Workers who have higher levels of education, training, or skills may be paid more than those with low levels of education or skills. This is because those with higher levels of education or skills are likely to be more productive and contribute more to the employer's profits.\n3. Job responsibilities: Workers who have greater responsibilities or more authority may be paid more than those who have less responsibility. For example, a manager may receive a higher salary than an entry-level worker because they have more responsibility for the company's success.\n4. Supply and demand: In situations where there is a high demand for a particular skill or type of job, wages for those jobs may be higher than those for jobs with lower demand. For example, during a pandemic, healthcare workers may be in high demand and receive higher wages than in other times.\n\nFrom the given list, (C) Increase in production of SUVs does not seem to be a factor that could cause wage differentials. While the production of SUVs may impact the overall demand for labor in related industries, it is not directly related to the skill level, risk level, or job responsibilities of workers. Meanwhile, (A) Higher risk job, (B) Investment in human capital, and (D) Racial discrimination are all possible factors that could cause wage differentials.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Increase in production of SUVs.",
