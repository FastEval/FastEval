            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Answer (C): Reasoning that ideas presented in an appealing manner are correct, regardless of the content of the message.\n\nExplanation: The fallacy of style over substance, also known as an appeal to style, occurs when someone is more persuaded by the way an argument is presented than by the actual content of the argument. This fallacy assumes that something that looks or sounds good is necessarily true, regardless of its actual merit. It is a form of fallacious reasoning that can be used to manipulate people's opinions and emotions.\n\nOption (A) is not correct because changing the meaning of a word or phrase from one part of the argument to another is known as equivocation, which is another type of fallacy.\n\nOption (B) is not correct because confusing figurative language with literal language is known as a figure of speech, which is a rhetorical device that can be used for stylistic effect but does not necessarily invalidate an argument.\n\nOption (D) is not correct because using emotionally charged language to create an impression about the subject of a claim is known as an appeal to emotion, which is another type of fallacious reasoning that focuses on people's emotions rather than their rational faculties.\n\nOption (C) is the correct answer because it describes the fallacy of reasoning that something is true simply because it is appealing or pleasing to the senses. This fallacy ignores the actual content of the message, focusing instead on its presentation style.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer to this question is (C) poisoning the well.\n\nExplanation:\n\nPoisoning the well is a way of suppressing evidence that eliminates a source of evidence from consideration by claiming the source is flawed, when there is no true relationship between the alleged flaw and the reliability of the source. The \"flaw\" mentioned in this fallacy is a general criticism of the source, rather than a specific issue with the evidence being presented.\n\nExplanation:\n\nFor example, in a debate, someone might attempt to discredit the evidence presented by their opponent by attacking their character, rather than addressing the evidence itself. This is an example of poisoning the well, as it tries to discredit the source of evidence, rather than looking at the evidence itself and examining its reliability.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe other options in the question are different fallacies.\n\n(A) Significance is a way of oversimplifying a complex issue by reducing it to one or two key factors, while ignoring other relevant factors.\n\n(B) Snob appeal is a way of using a claim with authority or prestige to win acceptance, rather than using evidence or reason.\n\n(D) Appeal to anonymous authority is a way of relying on the authority of an unnamed source, without providing any evidence or reason to support the claim.",

The options given are (A) Appeal to ignorance, (B) Double negative, (C) Equivocation, and (D) Burden of proof.\n3. To answer this question, we need to look for a fallacy in which a lack of evidence is presented as proof of something.\n4. Out of the given options, only option (A) Appeal to ignorance fits this description. This type of fallacy occurs when someone argues that because something is not proven false, it must therefore be true.\n5. This is a common mistake because the absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence. Just because we don't have evidence of something doesn't mean it's not there, but it doesn't prove that it is there either.\n6. Therefore, the answer is (A) Appeal to ignorance.\n\n(A)",
