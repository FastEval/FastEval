            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Robertsonian translocation is a form of chromosome abnormality in which two long arms of a chromosome fuse together. This results in a chromosome with a very short arm and a very long arm.\n\nTo determine where the fusion occurs in a Robertsonian translocation, we need to consider the structure of a chromosome. Chromosomes are made up of DNA, which is organized into units called genes. Genes are arranged along the length of the chromosome in a specific order.\n\nChromosomes are also organized into distinct regions, each with a specific function. The regions of a chromosome include the centromere, the short arm, the long arm, and the telomeres. The centromere is the region of the chromosome that connects to the spindle during cell division, while the short arm and long arm contain the genes. The telomeres are regions of DNA at the ends of the chromosome that protect the chromosome from deterioration.\n\nIn a Robertsonian translocation, two long arms of a chromosome fuse together. This means that the fusion occurs at the ends of the long arms of the chromosome. So the answer is: (D) ends of the long arms.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine which base in DNA adenine normally pairs with, we need to look at the base pairing rules of DNA. These are complementary relationships between bases, in which purines (adenine and guanine) can only pair with pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine, and uracil), and pyrimidines can only pair with purines.\n\nSince adenine is a purine, we can eliminate options (C) thymine and (D) uracil, as they are both pyrimidines. The two remaining options are (A) cytosine, which is a pyrimidine, and (B) guanine, which is also a purine. However, adenine can only pair with pyrimidines, so option (A) cytosine is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: (A) cytosine.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "This question involves understanding the mapping of human chromosomes, and the steps involved in the process. Here are my thoughts and reasoning on each statement:\n\n1. (A) has been restricted to the sex chromosomes because of small family sizes.\nExplanation: This statement is saying that the mapping of human chromosomes has been limited to only examining the sex chromosomes, which are X and Y. This may be because examining all 22 pairs of autosomes in a family can be difficult due to the small family sizes.\n2. (B) proceeded much more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available.\nExplanation: This statement is saying that as more DNA markers were discovered, the mapping of human chromosomes became more successful. This is because DNA markers help researchers identify specific regions of DNA and track the movement of these regions between generations.\n3. (C) has determined that the number of linkage groups is about twice the number of chromosomes.\nExplanation: This statement is saying that researchers have found that there are many more linkage groups than there are chromosomes. Linkage groups are regions of DNA that have been linked by genes inherited in the same fashion. This may be because there are many genes that can be inherited in multiple ways or because some genes overlap with other genes.\n4. (D) has demonstrated that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes.\nExplanation: This statement is saying that almost all of the DNA found in human genomes is involved in coding for genes. This means that DNA that was previously thought to be \"junk\" actually has a functional purpose in expressing genes. This may be surprising, but it shows how complex and interconnected the genetic machinery is.\n\nNow, here is the answer: (D) has demonstrated that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes.\n\nWhen we look at the statements separately, each one makes sense. However, when we put them together and look at the overall question, the answer is not clear. The question asks which statements have been found to be true. This means t",
