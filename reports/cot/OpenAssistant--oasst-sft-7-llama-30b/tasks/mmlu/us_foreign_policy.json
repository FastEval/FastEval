This view of America as a shining example for the rest of the world reinforced the idea of American exceptionalism, the belief that America was uniquely qualified to lead and influence the world. The Cold War also helped to create a sense of unity among Americans, who felt that their country was on the front lines of a global struggle against the spread of communism. This sense of unity and purpose helped to bolster support for American exceptionalism and the idea that America was a leader in the world.",

            "model_answer": "Franklin D. Roosevelt initially favored an \"isolationist\" stance on the part of the US during the 1930s for multiple reasons.\n\n(A) He believed that internal reform rather than international negotiation was the key to economic regeneration of the US.\n\nRoosevelt believed that focusing on domestic reforms, such as the New Deal programs, was more important than engaging in international negotiations. He wanted to focus on reviving the US economy and improving the lives of its citizens.\n\n(B) He believed that German domination of Europe would be in US interests.\n\nWhile the US was isolationist, Germany was able to expand its power and control in Europe. Roosevelt may have believed that it was in the best interests of the US to allow Germany to dominate Europe, as it could potentially counterbalance the power of the Soviet Union.\n\n(C) He always favored isolationism.\n\nWhile Roosevelt initially favored an isolationist stance, his views evolved over time. He eventually came to believe that the US could not remain isolated from the rest of the world and that it had a responsibility to take a stand against fascism and support democracy.\n\n(D) All of the above.\n\nRoosevelt's initial \"isolationist\" stance on the part of the US was influenced by multiple factors, including his belief in internal reform, his perceived benefits of German domination of Europe, and his overall isolationist predilection. As the 1930s progressed and the situation in Europe deteriorated, Roosevelt's stance and policies changed, leading to a greater involvement in international affairs.",
