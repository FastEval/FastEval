            "model_answer": "The United Nations Security Council is one of the six main organs of the United Nations. It is the only principal organ that has the power to make decisions that are binding on all member states. The Security Council has 15 members: 5 permanent members with veto power and 10 rotating members without veto power. The 5 permanent members are the United States, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom. The 10 rotating members are selected by the General Assembly for a term of two years. Each rotating member can only serve two consecutive terms and are not eligible for immediate re-election. The veto power is a unique feature of the Security Council that allows the permanent members to prevent a resolution from being adopted, even if it has the support of the majority of the Council members.",

He believed that internal reform rather than international negotiation was the key to economic regeneration of the US (A). FDR also believed that Germany's domination of Europe would be in the US's interests (B) as he saw it as a way to strengthen the country's economy and maintain its leadership. Lastly, FDR had a personal belief that the US should maintain domestic issues rather than getting involved in world politics (C).

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) A strand of neo-isolationist sentiment.\n\nExplanation: The \"New Populism\" refers to a political trend that emerged in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. It was associated with a growing sense of skepticism towards international organizations, agreements, and institutions, and a desire to reduce American involvement in global affairs. This was often characterized by resistance to free trade agreements, suspicion of international institutions like the United Nations, and a desire to protect American sovereignty. Option (A) is therefore not correct.\n\n(B) A strand of internationalist sentiment.\n\nExplanation: Option (B) is also incorrect. The New Populism was not associated with a desire to increase American involvement in global affairs, but rather to reduce it.\n\n(C) An expression of American cultural superiority.\n\nExplanation: Option (C) is also incorrect. The New Populism was not specifically about American cultural superiority, but rather about a skepticism towards internationalism and a desire to protect American interests.\n\n(D) Increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making.\n\nExplanation: Option (D) is also incorrect, as the New Populism was not specifically about increasing incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making. While public opinion certainly played a role in shaping the New Populism, it was not the primary driving force behind the trend.\n\nAnswer:\n(E) None of the above.",
