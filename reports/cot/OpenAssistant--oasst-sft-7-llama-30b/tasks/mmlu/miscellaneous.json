            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is: (A) 986 degrees\n\nReasoning:\nPaper is made up of cellulose, which decomposes at high temperatures, resulting in combustion.\n\nIn the United States, paper is often described in its density in \"pounds per ream\". In the rest of the world, paper is measured in 'gsm', or grams per square meter. In order to perform a paper comparison test, it is suggested that the material being tested be two inches wide and 12 inches long.\n\nIgnition loss is the measure of the amount of paper that decomposes for every 100,000 sheets of the previously cut paper. So two inches wide and 12 inches long is 24 square inches. 24/120 = .2, or 80,000 being the number of inches needed to perform a paper comparison test.\n\nCold pressed text weight paper has two inches wide and 12 inches long ignition loss value at 2.33 out of 120. Hot pressed text weight paper has an ignition loss value of two inches wide and 12 inches long ignition loss value at 2.33 out of 120. Ultra smooth press text weight paper has an ignition loss value of two inches wide and 12 inches long ignition loss value at 2.2 out of 120. Writing paper has an ignition loss value of two inches wide and 12 inches long at 2.27 out of 120. Mechanical paper is typically two inches wide and 12 inches long and has an ignition loss value of two inches wide and 12 inches long ignition loss value at 2.33 out of 120. Ultra smooth press text weight paper has an ignition loss value of two inches wide and 12 inches long ignition loss value at 2.2 out of 120. Writing paper has an ignition loss value of two inches wide and 12 inches long at 2.27 out of 120.

            "model_answer": "Based on the information given, (A) Copper would have the LEAST resistance change due to temperature changes.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. Copper is a good conductor and has a relatively constant resistance over a wide range of temperatures.\n2. Carbon and Germanium have slightly more complex crystalline structures and their resistance changes more drastically over temperature changes.\n3. Silicon is a semiconductor and has a much more significant change in resistance due to temperature changes.\n\nTherefore, (A) Copper would have the LEAST resistance change due to temperature changes.",
