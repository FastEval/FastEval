            "model_answer": "First, the teacher is conducting an instructional strategy that involves presenting students with examples of a certain genre, in this case short stories.\n\nSecond, the teacher is working with the students to identify defining characteristics of the genre. This indicates that the teacher is engaging in direct instruction, rather than leaving it up to the students to discover the key features of the genre on their own.\n\nThird, the instructional strategy is focused on a specific genre of writing, short stories, which indicates that it falls under the category of Discipline-Based Inquiry (DBI). DBI is an instructional strategy that focuses on helping students develop expertise in a specific discipline, such as literature or writing, through explicit instruction and analysis of examples within the genre.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Discipline-based Inquiry.",

            "model_answer": "To find the temperature at which paper burns, we can use Hess' Law of heat of combustion.\n\n1. First, we need to find the number of moles of oxygen required to burn 1 mole of carbon (C).\n\n2. When C + O2 \u2192 CO2 + H2O, 1 mole of oxygen is required for every 1 mole of carbon.\n\n3. Then, we can use the Hess's Law of heat of combustion equation, dQ = (\u0394H\u00b0 - RTlnQ)\n\n4. In this case, dQ = \u0394H\u00b0 - RTlnQ = -92.4 kJ (the enthalpy change or heat of combustion for carbon) - 8.314 J/K (the gas constant) * 298.15 K (the temperature in degrees Celsius) * ln(1/1) = 92.4 - 25.024 K = 67.376 K = -46.61 degrees Celsius\n\n5. To convert this to degrees Fahrenheit, we can use the conversion formula F = (\u00b0C \u00d7 9/5) + 32 = 66.81 degrees Fahrenheit\n\n6. Therefore, paper will burn at approximately 66.81 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAnswer: (A) 986 degrees",

The Varicella virus is part of the Alphaherpesvirus index. It is in the same taxonomy family as Human herpesvirus 1 and hepatitis simplex virus 1.
