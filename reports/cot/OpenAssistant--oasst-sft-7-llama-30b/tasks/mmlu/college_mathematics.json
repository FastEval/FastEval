Notice that e^x > x for x < 0, so the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0 only has real solutions if x > 0.\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by e^x to obtain x + 1 = 2e^x.\n3. Substitute x + 1 = 2e^x into the equation and obtain e^x = (x + 1)/2.\n4. We know that the left-hand side of the equation is positive, so we can conclude that x > 0.\n5. Substitute x = y - 1 into the equation to obtain the equation y/(y-1) = (x+1)/2.\n6.

The solutions for x that lie within the interval [0, 1] are x = 0 and x = 1.\n8. Since there are exactly two real solutions for x that lie within the interval [0, 1], we know that n = 1 and k = 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

First, we need to find the total number of ways to choose 3 suitcases out of 25.

We can do this by multiplying the number of ways to choose 2 of the damaged suitcases (5 C 2) by the number of ways to choose 1 of the non-damaged suitcases (20 C 1), and then adding this to the number of combinations where all 3 suitcases are non-damaged (20 C 3).\n\n(A) To find the number of combinations where all 3 suitcases are non-damaged, we can use the formula (n C k, j) = (n C k) x (n C j):\n\n25 C 3 = 1530 = (25 C 0) * (25 C 3) = (25 C 0) * (25 C 2) * (25 C 1)\n\nSo nCj = 25C1 = 25\nj = 3\n\nThen there are (25 C k, j) = (25 C k) x (25 C j) = 25C2 x 25C1 = 1500 such combinations.\n\n(B) Now we need to find the number of combinations where exactly 2 of the suitcases are damaged and one non-damaged.

This means that for each eigenvector v, there exists a scalar c(v) such that P(v) = c(v)v.\n\nThe Jordan Normal Form Theorem states that every matrix is similar to a Jordan matrix, which is a block diagonal matrix with eigenvalue blocks on the diagonal. Therefore, any linear transformation is similar to a diagonalizable matrix, meaning that it can be diagonalized by a linear transformation.\n\nNow, let us consider the given condition: P^2 = P. This implies that for any vector v in V, P^2(v) = P(v). In other words, P(v) = 2P(v) for any vector v in V. Therefore, for any eigenvector v with eigenvalue c(v), we have P(v) = 2P(v), which means that c(v) = 0 or c(v) = 2.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues of P are either 0 or 2, and the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 2 form an invariant subspace of P.\n\nNext, we need to determine which of the three conditions must be true. Let us analyze each one:\n\n* I. P is invertible. This means that there exists a linear transformation Q such that PQ = QP = I.

Therefore, option II is correct.\n\n* III. P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation. We know that P(v) = 0 for some vector v in V, because P(v2) = 0. Therefore, P is not the identity transformation. However, it is not the zero transformation either, because P(v1) = v1 and P(v2) = 2v2 are linearly independent eigenvectors.
