However, the remaining items on this list are not mentioned in the guideline.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because the guideline does not state that adverts must not cause \"jealousy\".\n\nOption (D) is the correct answer. This is because the guideline suggests that adverts must not encourage \"unsafe practices\", not cause \"distress\", \"fear\", or \"serious offence\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious.",

It does not prescribe corporate profit maximization.\n(B) Preference Utilitarianism states that actions should be chosen based on the preferences of the people affected by them, taking into account the intensity and duration of the preferences. This theory does not specifically prescribe corporate profit maximization.\n(C) The Categorical Imperative is a moral framework developed by Immanuel Kant. It states that we should act in a way that we can will as a universal law. This theory also does not prescribe corporate profit maximization.\n(D) The ethics of care is a theory that emphasizes the importance of relationships and emotional connection in decision-making. It does not specifically prescribe corporate profit maximization.\n\nThe answer is (E), despite limited direct prescription by normative theories, corporate profit maximization is most similar to the limited libertarianism ethical theory. Limited libertarianism states that individuals should be free from coercion as long as it does not interfere with the freedom of others. This theory is not concerned with maximizing corporate profit.\n\nAnswer: (E) Limited libertarianism.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) Civil, Relations, Outcomes.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The use of the word \"civil\" implies a specific type of regulation rather than a general use of the word \"regulation.\"\n2. The phrase \"relations with businesses\" suggests that the regulation has something to do with how civil society organizations (CSOs) interact with businesses.\n3. The phrase \"outcomes of such processes\" further emphasizes that the regulation has something to do with how CSOs and businesses interact and the results or consequences of their interaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Civil, Relations, Outcomes.",
