In an industrial ecosystem, the \"organisms\" are companies and industries, and the \"environments\" are the resources and wastes that are used and produced by those companies and industries. The idea is that companies and industries are interdependent due to the resources and wastes that they use and produce. This can be seen as a model for sustainability thinking, as it encourages companies and industries to consider their impact on the environment and on other companies and industries in the supply chain, rather than focusing only on their own individual impact.",
