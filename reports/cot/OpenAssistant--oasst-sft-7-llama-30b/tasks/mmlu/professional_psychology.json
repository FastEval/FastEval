            "model_answer": "The statement that expresses a relationship between aging and sexual functioning is (D): \"Aging is related to some loss of erectile rigidity in the male.\"\n\nExplanation of reasoning:\nStatement (A) suggests an increase in vaginal lubrication with aging, which would indicate improved sexual functioning. However, this statement does not directly indicate a relationship between aging and sexual functioning.\nStatement (B) suggests an increase in the frequency and number of orgasmic contractions in both sexes with aging, which would also indicate improved sexual functioning. However, this statement does not directly indicate a relationship between aging and sexual functioning.\nStatement (C) suggests that there is no significant relationship between aging and sexual responses in either sex, which would indicate that aging has no effect on sexual functioning. However, this statement does not account for the possibility that aging could have a negative effect on sexual functioning.\nStatement (D) suggests that aging is related to some loss of erectile rigidity in the male, which would indicate a negative effect of aging on sexual functioning in males. Therefore, this statement is the one that expresses a relationship between aging and sexual functioning.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "A teratogen is a substance that can have a negative impact on fetal development. These substances are also known as teratogens or teratogenic agents.\n(B)\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The given question asks about a substance that can have a negative impact on fetal development. The term \"teratogen\" is widely used to refer to a substance that can cause birth defects or developmental problems in fetuses. It is important to understand that not all substances are teratogens, and some substances may have more significant effects on fetal development than others.\n* The given options provide different possible answers that may be related to teratogens, but they do not fully define what teratogens are. For example:\n\t+ (A) An Apgar is a score used to assess the health of newborns at birth, which is typically based on their heart rate, respiratory effort, color, muscle tone, and reflexes. These scores are not directly related to teratogens or teratogenic agents.\n\t+ (C) It is only partially correct to state that teratogens are only a problem in the first six weeks of gestation. Teratogens can affect fetal development at any stage of pregnancy, including during the first six weeks, but their effects may be more severe or more likely to occur during critical periods of development.\n\t+ (D) A controlled substance is a drug or other substance that is regulated under federal or state laws. Not all controlled substances are teratogens, and many teratogens are not controlled substances. These terms are related but distinct.",

A flattened affect is a symptom of frontotemporal dementia, which includes Alzheimer's disease.\n4. Vascular dementia is associated with decreased blood flow to the brain, but the other symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.\n5.

Enmeshment occurs when there is too much togetherness or interdependence within the family, and this can be problematic for the overall functioning of the family system.
