The concept of one gradient descent update is a bit more abstract, as it can refer to different things depending on the context. If we assume that we are updating the parameters of a function in the direction of the gradient at each iteration, then the cost of one gradient descent update would depend on the size of the gradient and the number of parameters. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the reasoning:\n\n1. We have already computed the gradient of the cost function and stored it in a vector `g`. We know that `g` has the same length as the number of parameters in the function `f`.\n2. The gradient descent update of a parameter `x_i` requires computing `x_i + alpha * g_i`, where `alpha` is a constant learning rate.\n3. If we have `M` parameters and `N` data points, the cost of computing `N` gradient descent updates can be estimated as `M * N`, as each update requires `N` iterations over the data points.\n4. So the total cost of `K` gradient descent iterations can be estimated as `M * N * K`, as each iteration requires `N` gradient descent updates.\n5. If we assume that `K` is constant with respect to `N`, then the cost of one gradient descent update would be proportional to `M * N`.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the cost of one gradient descent update is:\n```\n(D) O(ND^2)\n```",
