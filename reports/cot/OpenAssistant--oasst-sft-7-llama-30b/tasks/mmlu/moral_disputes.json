According to Nathanson, punishment should be justified as retributive, which means that we punish people for what they deserve. Nathanson argues that the best way to understand the retributive aspect of punishment is to focus on the idea of desert. A person deserves to be punished if they have done something wrong, regardless of whether their actions have caused any harm or if they are likely to cause any harm in the future. This is consistent with retaliatory retributivism, which holds that we should punish people as a means of exacting retaliation or revenge for their wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, Nathanson supports (D) retaliatory retributivism.\n\n(D) retaliatory",
