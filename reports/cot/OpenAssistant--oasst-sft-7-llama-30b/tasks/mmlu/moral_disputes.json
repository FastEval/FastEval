            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand that the Just War Theory is a philosophical and ethical framework for evaluating the morality of wars, warfare, and military actions. It consists of two components: jus ad bellum and jus in bello.\n\n(A) jus in bello is a principle of the Just War Theory that refers to the rules governing the conduct of warfare once a country has gone to war. The principle of military necessity belongs to the jus in bello component.\n\nMilitary necessity refers to the proportional use of force in order to achieve military objectives, while minimizing harm to civilians, civilian objects, and the environment. It is a principle that seeks to balance the need for military action with the need to minimize harm.\n\n(B) jus ad bellum is a principle of the Just War Theory that refers to the rules governing the decision to go to war in the first place.\n\n(C) moral nihilism is a philosophical position that states that moral values do not exist and that it is meaningless to say that actions are right or wrong. It has no connection to the Just War Theory.\n\n(D) none of the above, as the principle of military necessity only belongs to the jus in bello component.\n\nThe answer is: (A) jus in bello.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) both its quantity and its quality.\nExplanation:\nJohn Stuart Mill was a utilitarian philosopher who emphasized the importance of pleasure as the ultimate aim of human action. According to Utilitarianism, an action is morally right if it produces the greatest amount of pleasure and the least amount of pain.\nIn his moral philosophy, Mill believed that the value of a pleasure depends on both its quantity and its quality. By \"quality,\" Mill meant the intensity and duration of the pleasure, while \"quantity\" refers to\nthe number of people affected by it. In other words, Mill believed that the value of a pleasure is determined by both how great it is and how many people experience it.\n\n(C) both its quantity and its quality",

This option suggests that the reason we act in a certain way towards an animal is determined by the wider effects that our treatment of the animal has on humanity.
