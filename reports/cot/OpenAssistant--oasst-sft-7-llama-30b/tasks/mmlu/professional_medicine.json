            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.\n\nThe patient experienced a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She also had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage. During her hospitalization, she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She was discharged from the hospital 2 weeks ago and had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge. She now says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh and examination shows decreased sensation to light touch on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh.\n\nThe most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. This nerve provides sensation to the skin on the lateral aspect of the thigh and is susceptible to compression from external sources such as prolonged sitting, wearing tight clothing, or external trauma. It is not related to the patient's medical history or current medication.\n\nA pulmonary embolism and retroperitoneal hemorrhage are not typically expected to cause compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, and a hematoma of the left thigh should have resolved by the time the patient saw the physician. Cerebral infarction and complications of the IVC filter placement are also not expected to cause sensory loss specifically to the thigh.",

His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04). Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation of these study results?\n\n(A) The findings are clinically and statistically significant\n(B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant\n(C) The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant\n(D) The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant",

If the p-value is less than 0.05, we can say that the findings are statistically significant.\n\nAnswer: (A) The findings are clinically and statistically significant\n\nExplanation:\nThe findings in the study are clinically significant because the absolute difference between the mean time for resolution of symptoms in the group receiving the new drug and the group receiving the placebo (6.5 days) is greater than the pre-specified criteria for clinical significance (5 days). This means that the new drug is more effective than the placebo in reducing the duration of common cold symptoms.\n\nThe findings are also statistically significant because the p-value is less than 0.05. This means that there is less than a 5% chance that the difference in findings between the group receiving the new drug and the group receiving the placebo occurred by chance.\n\nExplanation: (A) is correct.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine which lymph node it is most appropriate to evaluate first for evidence of metastasis, we need to consider the anatomy of the head and neck and the pattern of metastasis for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue.\n\n1. Anatomy of the head and neck: The tongue is a mobile organ in the floor of the mouth, surrounded by other mobile structures such as the mandible, floor of the mouth, and hyoid bone. It is divided into three parts: oral tongue, which is the most mobile part and easily exfoliable; posterior dorsal tongue; and base of tongue. The base of tongue extends from the level of the epiglottis to the carina of the trachea, and is the posterior part of the tongue closest to the pharyngeal wall. The lymphatics draining the tongue follow the blood vessels and nerves along the tongue's surface and deeper into the tongue through the perivascular sheath and submucosal space. They drain through the sublingual lymph node group and continue into the deep cervical lymph nodes, where the primary node station (LNPS) for oral cavity tumors is the jugulodigastric (JDG) or juguloauricular node, which is the lowest node in the submandibular area.\n2. Pattern of metastasis for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue: Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue follows a characteristic pattern of metastasis to regional lymph nodes. It drains through the sublingual lymph node group and crosses over the midline to the jugulodigastric node, which is the most common metastatic node. There are also other lymph node groups that may be involved, such as the juguloauricular node, the carotid node, and the parapharyngeal node.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation and physical examination results, it is most appropriate to evaluate the submental lymph nodes for evidence of metastasis first. There are several reasons for this:\n\n1. Chronology of metastasis: Since there is a 6-month history of a lump on the patient's tongue, there is a higher chance that the tumor has spread to the submandibular/submental region rather than the retropharyngeal, parotid or i",
