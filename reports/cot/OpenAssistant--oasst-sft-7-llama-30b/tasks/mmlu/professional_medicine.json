            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "I. First, we need to consider the patient's history and symptoms.\n\n* The patient had a pulmonary embolism and required hospitalization.\n* She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage and temporarily discontinued anticoagulant therapy.\n* She also underwent placement of an IVC filter.\n* She had a resolving hematoma on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago.\n* She has experienced persistent tingling and numbness in her left thigh since then, without other symptoms.\n\nII. Next, we should review the findings from the physical examination.\n\n* Vital signs are within normal limits.\n* There are no abnormalities in the skin.\n* Muscle strength is normal.\n* Sensation to light touch is decreased over a specific area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh.\n\nIII. Despite the many possible causes of neuropathy, we can narrow down the options by considering the symptoms and exam results.\n\n* The sensation of \"tingling and numbness\" is often associated with damage or pressure on a nerve.\n* The description of a specific area of decreased sensation in the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh is consistent with compression of a single nerve.\n* The prior treatment history suggests any complication of the IVC filter placement is possible.\n\nIV. Based on this information, the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation is:\n\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement.",

            "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of a low-grade fever, cough, and runny nose. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04). Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation of these study results?\n\n(A) The findings are clinically and statistically significant\n(B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant\n(C) The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant\n(D) The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "A) The findings are clinically and statistically significant.\n\nExplanation step-by-step:\nFirst, we need to understand the study results and their statistical significance. The question asks for the most appropriate interpretation of these study results, so we will evaluate each option:\n\n(A) The findings are clinically and statistically significant.\n\n(B) The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant.\n\nStatistical significance means that any observed differences between the treatment group (receiving the new drug) and the control group (receiving the placebo) are unlikely to have occurred by chance. So if we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis, it suggests that the new drug is effective in treating the common cold.\n\nHowever, clinical significance means that the observed differences are important or valuable in a practical sense, i.e., they are meaningful in real-life situations. For example, a new drug may have a statistically significant effect on lowering blood pressure, but if that effect is very small, it may not be clinically significant.\n\nIn this case, the mean time for resolution of symptoms was 6.4 days for the treatment group, which is lower than the 6.7 days for the control group (p=0.04). A difference of 0.3 days may not seem significant in a practical sense, but the study results indicate statistical significance (p=0.04).\n\n(C) The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant.\n\nBased on the given study results and statistics, it is unlikely that option (C) is the most appropriate interpretation.\n\n(D) The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant.\n\nAgain, this is unlikely given the study results and statistics, especially considering the p-value for statistical significance.\n\nNow to sum it up, option (A) is most appropriate because the study results are both statistically and clinically significant. Even though the difference in symptom duration is not very large in a practical sense, the study results have shown statistical significance.",

The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.

            "model_answer": "The patient has a history of pneumonia and has not seen a doctor since immigrating to the United States two months ago. The pulmonary examination was unremarkable, but the cardiac examination showed left ventricular hypertrophy and a systolic murmur. Additionally, an electrocardiogram (EKG) showed left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\nBased on this information, I suspect that the patient may have developed hypertension (high blood pressure) in response to an increased workload on the heart. The left ventricle is the chamber of the heart that pumps blood out to the body and the enlargement of this chamber seen on the EKG would be consistent with elevated workload. This increased workload could be caused by a narrowing of the tricuspid valve (right-sided heart valve) that controls blood flow from the right side of the heart to the lungs.\n\n(D) Tricuspid valve regurgitation",

This results in inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, which is the regulation of movement of fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation. The inhibition of fatty acid oxidation ultimately results in increased inhibition of all pathways related to fatty acid oxidation. As biopsy specimens were obtained showing increased concentrations of malonyl-CoA directly inhibits the Fatty acid Oxidation process, option (A) Fatty acid oxidation is the correct answer.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: According to the provided information about the patient's health, current treatment for ovarian cancer, and the symptoms presented by the patient (crying, pain, depressive behavior, and major depressive disorder), it's possible that the patient is experiencing emotional distress from her advanced cancer and suffering, as well as her medications.\n\nStep 2: However, there is no explicit indication that the patient is currently suicidal. It would not be an appropriate step to assess for suicidal ideation without any sign of it.\n\nStep 3: Starting a treatment of dextroamphetamine would be inappropriate without a clear diagnosis or evaluation of the patient's emotional state, especially given that the patient has been treating for major depressive disorder and taking fluoxetine, which is an antidepressant.\n\nStep 4: The current oxycodone dosage of 10 mg twice daily might be considered relatively low according to some resources. Hence, increasing it could be an appropriate next step in management.\n\nStep 5: Providing reassurance could help alleviate the patient's emotional state and help her cope with cancer-related distress or uncertainty.\n\nStep 6: Based on the patient's emotional distress and symptoms, including her advanced cancer, P Domains come into play to understand the patient's emotional distress and suffering. This information is relevant as the patient is being treated for hypertension, two years of chemotherapy, and major depressive disorder. It's essential to consider that the patient's mental state and emotional distress could affect her physical health and contribute to her symptoms such as not getting out of bed.\n\nStep 7: While some patients might prefer more autonomy in their decision-making, others might benefit from greater involvement from care providers, including doctors, psychiatrists, and other specialists. When clinical spheres overlap, strong interprofessional communication through team-based care becomes essential.",
