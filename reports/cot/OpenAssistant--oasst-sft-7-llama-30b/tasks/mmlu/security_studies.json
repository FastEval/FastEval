            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) The responsibility to remain sovereign is not an element of the responsibility to protect.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The responsibility to protect (R2P) is a principle in international law that emphasizes the protection of civilians during armed conflicts.\n* The four elements of R2P are:\n1. The responsibility to prevent: States have the primary responsibility to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.\n2. The responsibility to react: If a State fails to protect its population, the international community has the responsibility to take appropriate measures to prevent these crimes, including using force if necessary.\n3. The responsibility to rebuild: After crises, the international community has the responsibility to help States rebuild and promote sustainable peace.\n4. The responsibility to remain sovereign: While R2P places primary responsibility on States to protect their populations, it also respects the sovereignty of States and their right to make decisions about how to best protect their populations within the bounds of international law.\n\nTherefore (C) is not an element of R2P",

            "question": "Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\n\n(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "model_answer": "Answer: (A) \n\nThe liberal perspective on future energy security would argue that the global economy is interconnected, and the energy security of one country is dependent on the energy security of all other countries. This interdependence means that all core powers have a shared interest in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this economic order operates. With this economic order in place, there is a low likelihood of conflict between major powers over energy reserves. This perspective recognizes that free-market trading, rather than statism or neo-mercantilism, is based on the principles of liberalism. (A)",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated.\n(D) Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated.

For example, fiscal discipline and tax reform are directly aligned with the goals of the Washington Consensus, as they support economic growth and stability.\n\nStep 6: Based on this analysis, conclude that option D, Nationalization, does not align well with the goals of the Washington Consensus. While property rights may be an important consideration for a country's economy, nationalization of enterprises is not typically a recommended policy for promoting economic growth and stability.\n\nStep 7: Output the answer:\n(D) Nationalization",
