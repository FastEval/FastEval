            "model_answer": "This question is about the responsibility to protect, which is a global principle that places an obligation on states and international organizations to prevent atrocities, such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe four principles listed in the question are likely to be among the fundamental aspects of the Responsibility to Protect :\n(A) The responsibility to prevent is the first and primary pillar of Responsibility to Protect, it is the obligation to prevent the occurrence of atrocity crimes.\n(B) The responsibility to react, also known as the second pillar of responsibility to protect or responsibility to respond, is the international community's responsibility to respond to atrocity crimes if a state fails to protect its population.\n(C) The responsibility to remain sovereign means that the primary responsibility for protecting populations lies with the sovereign state. It means that intervention in a situation should be a last resort, only undertaken if the have failed and the lives of large numbers of people are at risk.\n(D) The responsibility to rebuild, refers to the obligation of the international community to help states to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of atrocity crimes.\n\nThe answer is (C) The responsibility to remain sovereign. Because there is no such element exist on the responsibility to protect, this can be exclude.",

So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal.

So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact. This suggests that environmental changes can be detrimental for national security if they weaken the economic base of an economy, which determines the military capacity.\n\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern. This suggests that environmental challenges are not necessarily a primary concern for national security, and that external military threats will remain the primary concern.\n\n(D) All of these options.

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated.\n(D) Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated.
