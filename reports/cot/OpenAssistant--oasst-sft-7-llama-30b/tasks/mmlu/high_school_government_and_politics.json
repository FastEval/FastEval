            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe establishment clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the government from establishing a state religion or showing preference for one religion over others. The free-exercise clause of the First Amendment guarantees the freedom to practice religion. The Supreme Court has sought to balance these two clauses in various cases over the years.\n\nOption (D) describes the balance the Supreme Court has struck between the establishment clause and the free-exercise clause. In the landmark case of Engel v. Vitale (1962), the Supreme Court ruled that government-sponsored prayer in public schools violates the establishment clause. However, in the case of Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe (2000), the Supreme Court ruled that student-led prayer at school events, such as football games, is constitutional as long as it is voluntary and not sponsored by the school.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the freedom of speech is protected under the First Amendment, and the Supreme Court has established narrow exceptions to this rule, such as the \"fire\" in a crowded theater example, but nowhere near as broad as the example given in (A).\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has the authority to revoke the tax-exempt status of churches for violating certain rules, such as engaging in political campaigns.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of administrative agencies created by Congress, and they can be dissolved or modified by Congress through legislation.",

This statement cannot be proven to be accurate, as the data on voter turnout by gender in the United States is not available for every year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) More women than men have voted in every presidential election since 1980.",

A child's political views are shaped by a combination of factors, including the geographical area in which they grow up, their family, the media they are exposed to, and their religion. However, the most significant factor is often the political views of their family.\n\nFamilies are one of the most influential sources of political socialization for children. They provide the child's first exposure to political attitudes and beliefs and often shape the child's understanding of the political world. The child may adopt the family's political views wholesale, or they may modify or reject them as they mature.\n\nThe other factors listed, while they can certainly exert some influence, may not be as strong in shaping a child's political views. For example, the media and religion can be inconsistent or vague, and a child may encounter different perspectives from various sources. The geographical area in which the child grows up may also vary in its political orientation or have relatively little impact.\n\nIn conclusion, while all of the above factors can shape a child's political views, the most significant influence comes from the family. To learn more about political socialization and other factors that shape political beliefs, you can check out books and articles on political science, sociology, and psychology.",

He or she is responsible for enforcing laws and overseeing the executive departments. The President is the leader of the government and makes important decisions for the country. He or she is assisted by the Vice President and a team of advisors, including the chief of staff.\n\nThe vice president, who is the President\u2019s assistant and may fill in for him or her if he or she cannot serve, is not likely to have as much control over the access cabinet secretaries have to the President as the President\u2019s chief of staff. The chief of staff is a trusted advisor who works closely with the President on a daily basis and manages the President\u2019s schedule, staff, and communications.\n\nThe national security advisor is responsible for providing the President with advice on national security and international affairs. However, this position is focused more on foreign policy and national security matters than on the day-to-day operations of the executive departments.\n\nThe chairman of the Federal Reserve Board is responsible for overseeing the nation's banking system and making decisions about monetary policy.
