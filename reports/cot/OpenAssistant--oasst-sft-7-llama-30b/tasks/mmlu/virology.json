            "model_answer": "To begin, we need to understand what polyomaviruses are. Polyomaviruses are a family of small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses that can cause serious diseases in animals, but are generally not associated with significant disease in humans. In fact, most polyomaviruses are not associated with disease in humans at all.\n\nIn the case of human polyomaviruses, there are currently 10 known to exist, each with its own name and characteristics. The 10 human polyomaviruses are:\n\n1. Human polyomavirus 1 (also known as \u201cBK virus\u201d)\n2. Human polyomavirus 2\n3. Human polyomavirus 3\n4. Human polyomavirus 4\n5. Human polyomavirus 5\n6. Human polyomavirus 6\n7. Human polyomavirus 7\n8. Human polyomavirus 8\n9. Human polyomavirus 9\n10. Human polyomavirus 10\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (C) 10.",

            "model_answer": "(A) Respiratory infections are a major cause of death globally. Respiratory infections can include pneumonia, influenza, and other illnesses that affect the respiratory system. Respiratory infections are often caused by viruses or bacteria and can be particularly dangerous, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children.\n\nStatistics show that respiratory infections are one of the leading causes of death globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2018, there were an estimated 2.97 million deaths due to pneumonia and 735,000 deaths due to tuberculosis. These numbers suggest that respiratory infections are a significant global health burden and are a top cause of death worldwide.",

In addition, formula is often expensive and may not be accessible to all families in these areas.\n\nFor this reason, we can eliminate option (A) and (D), as they do not align with the WHO's recommendations for exclusive breastfeeding.\n\nOption (B) is the best choice, as it follows the WHO's recommendations for exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months. This option provides the necessary nutrition and reduces the risk of infection for newborn infants in countries with limited access to safe water and low levels of education.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is the correct answer.",

In order to determine the correct answer, it would be necessary to consider the characteristics of astroviruses and the types of diseases they are known to cause.\n\nAstroviruses are a family of small, positive-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the genus Astrovirus. They are known to cause gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and intestine) in humans, particularly in children.\n\nBased on this information, my reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. Astroviruses are known to cause gastroenteritis in humans, particularly in children.\n2. Inflammation of the stomach and intestine often results in diarrhea and/or vomiting.\n3. Diarrhea and/or vomiting are not typical symptoms of acute pneumonia, hepatitis, or rashes.\n4.

            "model_answer": "First, let\u2019s understand what the adaptive immune system is:\n\nIt is the body's immune response to a pathogen that has previously invaded, modulated by the adaptive immune system.\n\n* The adaptive immune response modifies itself to rapidly respond to the pathogen again (Memory),\n* it occurs, modulated by the interaction between B cells, T cells, and monocytes (Lymphocyte cells),\n* And it results in the production of antibodies (A), clonal, autoreactive cytotoxic T cells (C), and clonal, fetal and autoreactive helper T cells (C).\n\nBased on this:\n\nIndicate which of the following is the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system.\n\n(A) Antibodies\n(B) T cells\n(C) Memory T cells\n(D) Clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells\n\nAntibodies are immunoglobulin Y protein molecules that play a role in immune response to pathogens. This is specific to certain pathogens. For this reason, I think that the answer is not (A).\n\nHelper T cells play a role in activating suppressor/cytotoxic T cells, but it does not seem that memory is based on these in particular. Because of this, I do not think that the answer is (C).\n\nClonal expansion of pre-existing specific cells (Na\u00efve T cells) conduct the above activities. Therefore, while applying (B), for the reason stated above, it is likely that it is only (D).\n\nAmong these four, Clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells (D) seems to be the most special characteristic.\n\nA = Antibodies (Depending on the pathogen)\nB = T cells (Activate suppressor/cytotoxic T cells, need to clonally expand for immune response)\nC = Memory T cells (Activate suppressor/cytotoxic T cells, but not specific to pre-existing T cells)\nD = Clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells (Required for immune response, based on clonal expansion of pre-existing cells)\nFinal answer: D",
