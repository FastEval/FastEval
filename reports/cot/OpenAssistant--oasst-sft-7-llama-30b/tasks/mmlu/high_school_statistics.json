            "model_answer": "Option (A) gives the P-value of this test.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The FDA investigator has obtained seven tablet weights, and ran a hypothesis test to test the claim that the weight of all seven tablets is close to the claimed weight of 300 milligrams.\n* To do this, the investigator computed the sample mean, and obtained a sample standard deviation.\n* Since the sample size is 7, the t-distribution can be used for the hypothesis test.\n* The t-test statistic is calculated as the ratio of the sample mean (which is close to 300) and the sample standard deviation (which gives the 'noise' in the data).\n* Using the t-distribution for a sample of seven and a sample mean close to 300, we see that the t-statistic is equal to 1.54.\n* Then the p-value is P(t > 1.54).",

A higher degree of freedom results in a t-distribution that is more like the normal distribution (rounded). A lower degree of freedom results in a flatter t-distribution (flatter tops and bottoms).\n\nThe t-distribution can have any mean and standard deviation. For example, a t-distribution with 10 degrees of freedom has a standard deviation of 2.23 due to the ratios of the change in degree of freedom.\n\nThe t-distribution is typically more spread out than the normal distribution.

            "model_answer": "(D) This study was an experiment in which the subjects were used as their own controls.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe study described involves manipulating the independent variable (alcohol consumption in the form of three beers) and measuring the dependent variable (reaction time to a simple stimulus) before and after the manipulation. Since the subjects acted as their own controls (i.e., each subject is their own control group), this is an example of a within-subjects design, also known as a repeated measures design. This is a type of experimental study, rather than an observational study.\n\nThe statement in (B) is incorrect because lack of blocking only applies to between-subjects designs, not within-subjects designs like the one described here.\n\nThe statement in (C) is incorrect because the placebo effect can still occur in within-subjects designs, as some participants may still experience an effect even if they did not actually consume alcohol.\n\nThe statement in (A) is closest to being correct, but it is not completely correct. Although the study described is a within-subjects experimental design, it is not an entirely observational study because it involves manipulation of the independent variable (alcohol consumption) and measurement of the dependent variable (reaction time).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).",
