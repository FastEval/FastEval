            "model_answer": "Step 1: Find the z-score for a time interval of 25.3 minutes, which is between 0 and 35 minutes.\n\nStep 2: Subtract the mean time from the z-score: z = 25.3 - 35\nz = -10.7\n\nStep 3: Divide the z-score by the standard deviation of the time intervals:\nz = -10.7 / 10 = -1.07\n\nStep 4: Find the time interval in the standard normal distribution with this z-score:\nz-score = -1.07\nTime interval = -0.57 to 0.479\n\nStep 5: Convert the time interval from the standard normal distribution to the cumulative distribution function:\nTime interval = -0.57 to 0.479\nCumulative distribution function = 0.062 to 0.6219\n\nStep 6: Multiply the cumulative distribution function by 100,000 to determine the number of riders who wait less than 25.3 minutes:\n100,000 riders x 0.6219 = 62,190\n\nStep 7: Subtract the number of riders who wait less than 25.3 minutes from the number of total riders to determine the shortest time interval:\n150,000 total riders - 62,190 riders = 87,810 riders\n\nStep 8: Calculate the time interval associated with 87,810 riders between 0 and 35 minutes: 25.39 minutes\n\nStep 9: Output the answer as a single letter with parentheses.\n\n(B) 31.7 to 39.3 minutes\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the longest time interval associated with 100,000 riders who wait less than a certain number of minutes. Since time intervals are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes, we can use the empirical rule of thumb that about 95% of the population falls within 2 standard deviations from the mean.\n\nTo arrive at a time interval, we first find the z-score for a time interval of 25.3 minutes, which falls between 0 and 35 minutes. We then calculate the number of riders who wait less than 25.3 minutes by multiplying the cumulative distribution function of the time interval by the total number of riders.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of riders who wait less than 25.3 minutes from the total number of riders to find the shortest time interval in the remaining riders. This interval falls between 39.3 and 35 minutes.\n\nTherefore, answer (B) 39.3 to 31.7 minutes is the correct answer.",

The standard deviation is a measure of the spread or dispersion of a set of data relative to the sample mean. A data point that is one standard deviation away from the mean is considered to be one standard deviation above the mean or one standard deviation below the mean.\n\nOne standard deviation above the mean height for adult men is 70 + 4 = 74 inches. Therefore, the man is one standard deviation above the mean height for adult men.\n\nOne standard deviation above the mean height for all women is 66 + 3 = 69 inches. Therefore, the woman is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height for all women.\n\nSince the woman is more than one standard deviation away from the mean height for all women, she is considered more unusually tall within her sex.\n\nAnswer: (D) The woman, because her height is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height of all women, whereas the man\u2019s height is only one standard deviation above the mean height of all men.",

Different `t`-distributions rely on different degrees of freedom (`df`) and correspond to more peaked (or fat-tailed) distributions when the `df` is low. (For large `df` the `t`-distribution converges to a normal distribution.) The `t`-distribution (except for the `df`-infinite case) always has a non-zero mean. The `t`-distribution corresponding to a single observation `x` further has a variance different from one, corresponding to at least minor scaling. The `t`-distribution also necessarily has a median (except for the `df`-infinite case) differing from zero. (For more information, see the `t`-distribution on Wikipedia).",
