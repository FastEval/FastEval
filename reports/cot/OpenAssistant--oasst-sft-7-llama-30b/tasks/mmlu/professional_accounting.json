            "model_answer": "A, B, C, and D are all correct for a nonissuer with respect to audit sampling risks.\n\nA: Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population. Nonsampling risk can arise because of the inappropriate extrapolation from a sample to a population during evidence evaluation or due to the misinterpretation of the existing evidence.\n\nB: Nonsampling risk can arise because the auditor may fail to recognize misstatements. Nonsampling risk may also arise from the inadequate training of the audit team, the inability to gather adequate evidence to eliminate risk, or the inattention of the auditors.\n\nC: Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. When examining a population of transactions or account balances, the use of\ninappropriate samples or no sampling at all will inevitably lead to \"surprises\" and differences between the expected balance of net income and/or retained earnings.\n\nD: Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. The inappropriate extrapolations\u2014to too few individual transactions\nor account balances or too few characteristics of events or transactions\u2014can lead to unacceptable sampling risk.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the effect of Dean Co.'s error on the bond carrying amount, retained earnings, and earnings at June 30, year 12, we need to analyze how the straight-line method and effective interest method differ in amortizing the premium.\n\n1. The straight-line method amortizes the premium over the effective life of the bond.\n2. The effective interest method calculates the interest expense for each period based on the effective interest rate, which considers the original issue price, any premium or discount, and the contractual interest payments over the life of the bond.\n3. The effective interest method produces a higher interest expense in the early periods, as it considers the time value of money, while the straight-line method amortizes the premium evenly over the life of the bond.\n4. As a result, when Dean incorrectly uses the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method, the bond carrying amount will be overstated, as the premium was amortized evenly over the life of the bond.\n5. The retained earnings and earnings will also be overstated, as the higher interest expense from the effective interest method would have reduced the reported net income.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Overstated, Understated.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(B) $104.29\n\nThe price of a bond is the present value of its future cash flows, discounted back to the present using the market interest rate.\n\nIn this case, the bond pays $5 in annual coupons, so it will pay $5 x 3 = $15 in coupons over three years.\n\nThe face value of the bond is $100, so the total cash flow from the bond is $15 + $100 = $115.\n\nTo find the price of the bond, we need to discount these future cash flows back to the present using the market interest rate of 6%. We can do this using a discount factor of $1/(1+6%) ^ 3 = 0.832.\n\nWe then multiply each cash flow by the appropriate discount factor: $15 * 0.832 = $12.52, and $100 * 0.832 = $83.20.\n\nSo the present value of the bond's cash flows is $12.52 + $83.20 = $95.72.\n\nTo find the price of the bond, we need to round this value to the nearest cent. We see that $95 is better than $96, so the price of the bond is $104.29.\n\nAnswer: (B) $104.29",
