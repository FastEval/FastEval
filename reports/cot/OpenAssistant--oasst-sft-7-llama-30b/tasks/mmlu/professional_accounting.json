            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the estimated yearly yield on the investment.\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many hours the limousine will be rented per year. We can do this by multiplying the number of hours per day by the number of days in a year:\n\n2 hours per day * 365 days in a year = 730 hours per year\n\n2. Next, we need to find out how much revenue the limousine will generate per year. We can do this by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of renting hours per year:\n\n$245 per hour * 730 renting hours per year = $179,550 per year\n\n3. Finally, we need to find out how much the limousine will earn per year compared to its initial cost. We can do this by dividing the yearly revenue by the cost of the limousine:\n\n$179,550 per year / $98,000 = 1.84\n\nSo, the estimated yearly yield on the investment is 184%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",
