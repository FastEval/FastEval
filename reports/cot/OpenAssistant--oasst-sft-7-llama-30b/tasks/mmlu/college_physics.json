The ground state of an atom is the state with the lowest energy. To find the total spin quantum number, you need to find the number of electrons in the ground state since the spin quantum number is the same for all of them. \n\nBy the Aufbau principle, the electrons of neutral nitrogen of atomic number 7 will fill its orbitals in the order of increasing energy: 8 of them to 1s (A), 2 of them to 2p (8 of them to 1s), 2 of them to 2px and 28 of them to 2py (A), 2 of them to 3p, 2 of them to 3px and 2 of them to 3py (A).\n\nHence, the total spin quantum number is 1/2 of the total number of electrons of 8 (not 7 since nitrogen is neutral), which is option (8 of them to 1s), since all electrons in the ground state of neutral nitrogen of atomic number 7 have spins of 1/2 each.",

The first capacitor is charged to a voltage, and when it is disconnected from the battery, it will retain that charge. It will have a capacitance of C and a charge of Q, both of which are related to each other by the equation Q = C*V, where V is the voltage across the capacitor. In other words, the charge (Q) stored on the capacitor is equal to the capacitance (C) multiplied by the voltage across the capacitor (V).\n\nThe other two capacitors, when initially uncharged and connected in series, will have a combined capacitance of 2C. When the first capacitor is charged to a voltage of V_0, these two capacitors will be connected across it, allowing them to share the charge.\n\nTo determine the final voltage on the first capacitor, we need to calculate the total capacitance between the first capacitor and the other two. Since the capacitors are identical, we can treat them as one centrosymmetric system. Therefore, the total capacitance between the first capacitor and the other two will be:\n\nC_total = C_1 + 2C_2 = 2C_1 + C_2 = 2C\n\nWhere C_1 is the capacitance of the first capacitor and C_2 is the capacitance of each of the other two capacitors.\n\nNow, we can use the equation Q = C*V to determine the final voltage on the first capacitor. The charge (Q) stored on the first capacitor will be shared equally between all three capacitors. Therefore, the final voltage on the first capacitor (V_F) will be:\n\nQ = C_total * V_F\n\nTo solve for V_F:\n\nQ = 2C * V_F\nV_F = Q / (2C) = V_0 / (2C)\n\nThe final voltage on the first capacitor will be V_0 / 2C. To select the correct answer, we need to identify which option contains this value.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) V_0 / 3\n\nTo recap, I used the concept of centrosymmetry to combine the three capacitors into a single system, and then I calculated the total capacitance between the first capacitor and the other two.
