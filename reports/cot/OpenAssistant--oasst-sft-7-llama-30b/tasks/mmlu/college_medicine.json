            "question": "A police officer carries out hundreds of traffic stops every year. When his supervisor is reviewing the officer\u2019s records for the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of various genders, ages, and races. However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child. What psychological framework would directly address the unconscious bias in his behavior? \n\n(A) Behaviorist\n(B) Psychoanalytic\n(C) Cognitive behavioral\n(D) Humanistic",

What are Fatty Acids?\n\nFatty acids are long-chain molecules that are the main components of fats, and they are crucial sources of energy for organisms.\n\n* * *\n\nII. Why do Fatty Acids need to be Transported into the Mitochondria?\n\nFatty acids cannot be broken down or utilized for energy production in the mitochondria unless they are transported into the mitochondria because the mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to fatty acids.\n\n* * *\n\nIII. What are the Steps Involved in the Transport of Fatty Acids into the Mitochondria?\n\nThe transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria involves several steps, including:\n\n1. Hydrolysis of the fatty acid from its ester bond in triglycerides or phospholipids by lipases, generating free fatty acids.\n2. Facilitated diffusion of free fatty acids across the cytosol into the mitochondria by a protein called Fatty Acid Transport Protein (FATP).\n3. In the presence of coenzyme A (CoA), the free fatty acid is converted to an acyl-CoA by the action of Acyl-CoA Synthetase.\n4. The acyl-CoA is then transported into the mitochondria by the action of Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I).\n5. Inside the mitochondria, the acyl-CoA is broken down into Acetyl-CoA, which can be further metabolized to generate FADH2, NADH, and ATP.\n\nNow, we can answer the original question:\n\n(B) coenzyme A (CoA) is the answer.",

            "question": "Sauna use, sometimes referred to as \"sauna bathing,\" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]\n\nBased on the article, which of the following statements is the author likely to agree with?\n\n(A) Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use.\n(B) Patients on a diet would benefit from sauna use.\n(C) Salt restriction would be equal to sauna use for hypertensive patients.\n(D) Patients with skin conditions may be cured with sauna use.",

When DFP binds to ACE, the ACE enzyme is rendered permanently inactive. This makes DFP a potent toxin, with lethal amounts at less than 100 mg.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) Irreversible inhibition.\n\nExplanation:\n\nHydrolase enzymes, like ACE, can be inhibited in one of three ways: competitive inhibition, non-competitive inhibition, or irreversible inhibition. In competitive inhibition, an inhibitor binds to the enzyme's active site but cannot be converted into product. Consequently, the inhibited enzyme binds to substrate less efficiently. In non-competitive inhibition, an inhibitor binds everywhere but the enzyme's active site. The enzyme can still bind substrate and form product. Non-competitive inhibition can increase the enzyme's Vmax. Irreversible inhibition happens when an inhibitor permanently binds to the active site of an enzyme, effectively rendering the enzyme inactive. To regain activity, the enzyme needs to be free of inhibitor.",
