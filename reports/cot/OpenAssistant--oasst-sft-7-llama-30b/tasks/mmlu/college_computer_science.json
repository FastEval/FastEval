Here is the reasoning step by step:\n\n(A) The access matrix approach stores information in the form of a matrix. If this matrix is very large, it can become difficult to manage and manipulate. This difficulty can make it difficult to use the access matrix approach effectively.\n\n(B) The access matrix approach is capable of expressing complex protection requirements, but these requirements may not be easily understood or managed. This can make it difficult to use the access matrix approach effectively.\n\n(C) Deciding whether a process has access to a resource is not necessarily undecidable. It may be possible to determine whether a process has access to a resource by checking the access matrix for the appropriate entries. This difficulty may make it difficult to use the access matrix approach effectively.\n\n(D) This difficulty is not present in the access matrix approach. It is possible to express who has rights to change the access matrix.

It permits implementation of virtual memory:\nIn a purely segmented memory system, virtual memory allows the use of a larger memory space than is physically present in the system. This is achieved by dividing physical memory into segments and mapping them to a virtual memory space. This allows multiple processes to share a common memory space and roam freely.\n\nIII.
