            "model_answer": "Let's begin by explaining the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The tension in a string affects the speed of waves traveling through it.\n2. According to the speed of sound equation, the wave speed is inversely proportional to the square root of the tension.\n3. Standing waves are created by oscillations with specific wavelengths.\n4. The wavelength of a standing wave is inversely proportional to the wave speed, according to the wave speed equation.\n\nWe finished explaining the reasoning step-by-step. The answer is C. The standing waves will have a wavelength that is greater than the previous standing waves.\n\nHere is some additional context explaining why C is the correct answer:\n\nBy increasing the tension in the string, the wave speed will increase, which will cause the wavelength of the standing waves to decrease. This is because the wavelength of a standing wave is inversely proportional to the wave speed, according to the wave speed equation.

When the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, its acceleration is at its maximum value, which means that the force of the spring is also at its maximum value.

The acceleration due to gravity acts only on the small block and the force of gravity on the block is mg.
