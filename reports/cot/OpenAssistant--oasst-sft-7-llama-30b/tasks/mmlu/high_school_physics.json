Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\n\nStanding waves are created by superposition of traveling waves, and the wavelength of the standing waves is determined by the frequency of the generator and the length of the string. When the tension in the string is increased, the wave speed is also increased. According to the wave speed equation, wave speed is inversely proportional to wavelength.

We are given two identical capacitors hooked in parallel to an external circuit.\n2. We need to determine which of the three given quantities (charge, voltage, and capacitance) must be the same for both capacitors.\n3. We begin by considering what happens when we hook capacitors in parallel.\n4. When capacitors are connected in parallel, the circuit acts like a single larger capacitor with the same charges and voltages on both sides.\n5. This means that the total amount of charge across the capacitors remains the same. Therefore, (A) I is not the answer, as the charge will not necessarily be the same for both capacitors.\n6. The voltage across each capacitor in a parallel circuit is the same as the voltage across the other capacitor. Therefore, (B) II is not the answer, as the voltage will not necessarily be the same for both capacitors.\n7. Since the capacitors are identical, they both have the same capacitance. Therefore, (C) II and III is the answer, as the capacitance will be the same for both capacitors.\n8. Therefore, the answer is (C) II and III only.\n9.

            "model_answer": "The answer is (A). This can be understood by applying energy conservation principles to the system.\n\nThe total mechanical energy of the system is given by:\n\nE = (1/2)kA^2 + (1/2)mv^2\n\nWhere A is the amplitude of the oscillation, m is the mass of the original block, and v is the velocity of the original block at its maximum displacement.\n\nIf the small block is placed on top of the original block, the total mechanical energy remains the same. This means that the kinetic energy of the system increases by mgh, where g is the acceleration due to gravity and h is the height of the small block.\n\nSo the gravitational potential energy of the small block is changed by mgh, and the elastic potential energy of the spring has to be changed by the same amount.\n\nTherefore, the maximum height of the small block before it slides off can be written as:\n\nmgh = (1/2)k(A')^2\n\nWhere Anode height of the small block is given by:\n\nANo = A - (g/k)t\n\nWhere t is the time since the small block was placed on the original block.\n\nThus, the condition for the small block to remain stationary on the original block is:\n\n(g/k)t <= (2/ANo)\n\nor\n\nt <= (2/ANo)\n\nTherefore, the small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, because t is lowest at this point.

            "model_answer": "The answer is (A).\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The acceleration of the box is given by the equation a = (\u03bcg - mv0^2/m) / (v0^2/m + (\u03bc/m)v0^2), where 'a' is acceleration, \u03bc is the coefficient of kinetic friction, g is acceleration due to gravity, and v0 and m are the initial speed and mass of the box, respectively.\n\n2. The ratio of Kinetic Energy (KE) to initial potential energy (PE) at the time of reaching rest is given by KE/PE = 1. After solving for v0^2, we can rearrange the equation to read v0^2 = (KE/m) - \u03bcg(PE/m).\n\n3. Then, we use the work-energy theorem W = KE + PE to write KE = 1/2mv0^2 - 1/2m(mv0)^2 and PE = mgh, where h is the height the box moves.\n\n4. Plugging the expressions for KE and PE into the equation above, we get v0^2 = (1/2mv0^2 - 1/2m(mv0)^2) - \u03bc(mgh).\n\n5. Solving for v0^2, we get v0^2 = (1/2g\u03bc - (2mun)^2)/(2mun - 1).\n\n6. Using the fact that un = v0/sqrt(\u03bcg), where 'un' is the normal force acting on the box, we can rewrite the equation as: v0^2 = 2(1/2mun^2 - 1/2m).\n\n7. Finally, we can rearrange the equation as v0^2 = 2mun^2 - 2, and solve for 'A'. Plugging v0^2 = (1/2mun^2 - 1/2m) into the output equation, we get A) v0^2/(2\u03bcg), which is the correct answer.",
