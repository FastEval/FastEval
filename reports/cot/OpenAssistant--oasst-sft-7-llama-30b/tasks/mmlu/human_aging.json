Gero-education focuses on education and learning about the aging process, but it is not the same as the study of older adults and aging.\n\n(B) Geropsychiatry focuses on the mental health and well-being of older adults, but it is not the same as the study of older adults and aging.\n\n(A) Gerontology is the study of older adults and aging. This term encompasses a wide range of topics, including the biology and physiology of aging, the social and psychological aspects of aging, and the care and support of older adults.\n\n(C) Geriatrics is the branch of medicine that focuses on the care of older adults. While geriatrics and gerontology share some overlap in terms of the care of older adults, they are not the same thing. Gerontology is a broader field that encompasses a variety of topics related to aging, while geriatrics focuses specifically on the medical care of older adults.\n\n(A) Gerontology",

The thickness of the lens determines the flexibility of the lens and its ability to change shape andfocus on objects at different distances.\n\n(B) It yellows\n\nThe lens of the eye does not usually yellow as people age. However, the amount of pigment in the iris, which is the colored part of the eye, may decrease, causing the iris to appear less colorful and the eye to appear more yellow.\n\n(C) It becomes clouded\n\nThe lens of the eye may become clouded as people age, a condition known as cataracts. Cataracts can cause vision problems and make it difficult to see objects clearly, especially at night.\n\n(D) It fills with fluid\n\nThe lens of the eye does not usually fill with fluid as people age.
