            "model_answer": "The question asks about the cause of nearsightedness, also known as myopia. The correct answer is:\n\n(B) too little curvature of the cornea and lens\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Nearsightedness is a condition in which the eye has difficulty focusing on distant objects due to a refractive error. When the light enters the eye, it refracts (bends) as it passes through the cornea and lens.\n* Normally, the cornea and lens bend the light to focus on the retina. However, in nearsighted individuals, the cornea and lens do not refract the light enough to focus clearly on the retina.\n* Too little curvature of the cornea and lens leads to nearsightedness, as the light fails to focus on the retina and instead focuses in front of it.\n* The other options are incorrect because:\n* (A) Too much curvature of the cornea and lens is not the cause of nearsightedness, as it would lead to hyperopia (farsightedness).\n* (C) Too much curvature of the iris and lens does not affect the way light is refracted, as the iris only controls the amount of light that enters the eye.\n* (D) Too little curvature of the iris and lens is not the cause of nearsightedness, as the iris does not affect the way light is refracted.\n\nAnswer: (B).",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question correctly, we need to understand the meaning of \"Delusions of grandeur\" and identify which mental disorder is most associated with it.\n\nDelusions of grandeur refers to a belief that one is exceptionally talented, powerful, or important, despite a lack of evidence to support these beliefs. This type of belief is often considered abnormal or irrational.\n\nWhen considering which mental disorder is most associated with delusions of grandeur, we can look at the symptoms of each disorder and identify which one most prominently features these types of beliefs.\n\nAs we examine the options, we can see that option (B) schizophrenia most prominently features delusions of grandeur. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that is characterized by abnormal beliefs, perceptions, and behaviors. One common symptom of schizophrenia is delusions of grandeur, in which individuals may believe they have exceptional talents, abilities, or powers.\n\nTherefore, our final answer is (B) schizophrenia.",

Validity is a fundamental concept in test construction and evaluation, and refers to the degree to which a test measures what it is intended to measure or the precision with which it captures the construct of interest. In other words, a test is considered valid if it is able to accurately measure the knowledge, skills, or abilities that it is intended to measure. This means that the test scores should be a reliable and accurate representation of the underlying construct or concept that the test is designed to measure.",
