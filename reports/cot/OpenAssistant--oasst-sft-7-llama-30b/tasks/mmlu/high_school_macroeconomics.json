            "model_answer": "When an expansionary fiscal policy leads to a large increase in real output and a small increase in the price level, it can be inferred that:\n\n(A) inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus.\n\nThis inference can be made because there is a small increase in the price level. If the price level were not previously impacted by inflation, it would be likely that the large increase in real output would lead to a much larger increase in the price level.\n\n(B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n\nThis inference can be made because there is a large increase in real output. If there were no unemployed resources in the economy, it would not be possible to increase real output in such a large magnitude.\n\n(C) aggregate supply decreased.\n\nThis cannot be inferred because the increase in real output and small increase in price level suggest that there is still excess supply in the economy.\n\n(D) aggregate demand is steeply sloped.\n\nThis cannot be inferred because it is not possible to determine the slope of aggregate demand from the information given.",

            "model_answer": "A likely cause of falling Treasury bond prices might be (B) contractionary monetary policy.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Treasury bond prices are inversely related to interest rates. When interest rates increase, the price of Treasury bonds tends to decrease, and vice versa.\n2. Contractionary monetary policy refers to actions taken by a central bank to reduce the money supply and increase interest rates in the economy.\n3. When a central bank engages in contractionary monetary policy, it is likely to have an upward impact on interest rates.\n4. An increase in interest rates could lead to a decrease in the price of Treasury bonds.\n\nThus, (B) contractionary monetary policy is a likely cause of falling Treasury bond prices.",
