From this it can be inferred that\n\n(A) inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus.\n(B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n(C) aggregate supply decreased.\n(D) aggregate demand is steeply sloped.",

            "model_answer": "(B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n\nThe statement \"an expansionary fiscal policy leads to a large increase in real output and a small increase in the price level\" implies that before the fiscal stimulus, there were some unemployed resources in the economy. This means that there were people who were willing to work but were not currently in the labor force for some reason, such as lack of job opportunities.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "There are four parts to this question, so we will work through them one by one:\n(I) The market value of movies made in Africa by U.S. citizens.\nThe United States GDP counts economic activity within the United States, which would not include something made outside of the United States. Economic activity in another country is not included in U.S. GDP. Because of this, (I) is not included in U.S. GDP.\n\n(II) The market value of olive oil made in Italy and sold in the United States.\nIn order for something to be considered part of the United States GDP, it has to be done within the United States. In this case, the olive oil is not made in the United States. If it were not for this, then (II) would be included in the United States GDP. However, since the olive oil is made in Italy, it is not considered part of United States GDP.\n\n(III) The market value of blue jeans made in the United States and sold in Japan.\nIn order for something to be included in United States GDP, it must be made in the United States. Blue jeans made in the United States and sold in Japan would be considered part of United States GDP.\n\n(IV) The market value of wine made in the United States by Canadian citizens.\nOne's citizenship has no affect on whether something is included in United States GDP as long as the good in question is made in the United States. The wine being made by Canadian citizens in the United States would be considered part of United States GDP.\n\nTaking all of this together allows us to find our answer. We know that (I) and (II) are not in United States GDP because the goods were made outside of the United States. We know that (III) is in United States GDP because the good was made in the United States. We know that (IV) is in United States GDP because the good was made in the United States. Because of this, we know (III) and (IV) are in the United States GDP. Al",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Let me attempt to answer this question step by step.\n\nStep 1: Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) and Aggregate Demand (AD) represent the willingness and ability of firms to produce goods and services and the willingness of consumers to purchase those goods and services, respectively.\n\nStep 2: When both SRAS and AD increase, this means that firms are able to produce more goods and services and consumers are willing to purchase more of those goods and services.\n\nStep 3: This increase in production and consumption can lead to an increase in real GDP, as more goods and services are being produced and sold.\n\nStep 4: The price level represents the average price of goods and services in the economy. When SRAS and AD increase, competition among firms can increase, which can lead to lower prices and a decrease in the price level.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can say that when both SRAS and AD increase, real GDP is likely to increase, but the price level is uncertain, and may either increase or decrease.\n\nStep 6: Based on the information provided, the correct answer is (C) The price level rises but the change in real GDP is uncertain.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we can consider the relationship between Treasury bond prices and the policies mentioned in the options.\n\n(A) Expansionary monetary policy. An expansionary monetary policy is one in which the central bank takes measures to stimulate the economy, usually by increasing the money supply. One way to accomplish this is through the purchasing of government bonds, which lowers the interest rate and, in turn, causes an increase in demand for bonds, leading to an increase in bond prices. Since an expansionary monetary policy would increase the demand for government bonds, it is unlikely to be a cause of falling Treasury bond prices.\n\n(B) Contractionary monetary policy. Contrary to (A), a contractionary monetary policy is one in which the central bank takes measures to slow the economy, usually by decreasing the money supply. One way to accomplish this is through the selling of government bonds, which increases the interest rate and, in turn, causes a decrease in demand for bonds, leading to a decrease in bond prices. Since a contractionary monetary policy would decrease the demand for government bonds, it could be a cause of falling Treasury bond prices.\n\n(C) Depreciating dollar. A depreciating dollar refers to the decrease in the value of currency in the foreign exchange market. The price of Treasury bonds is denominated in dollars and is based on the interest rate that the government pays on its bonds. If dollars are worth less, investors may need to purchase more dollars to buy a Treasury bond, leading to a decrease in demand and, therefore, a decrease in bond prices. Since a depreciating dollar could cause a decrease in the demand for Treasury bonds, it could be a cause of falling Treasury bond prices.\n\n(D) Fiscal policy designed to reduce the budget deficit. Fiscal policy is the use of government spending, tax policy, and the budget to influence economic activity. Reducing the budget deficit is one part of fiscal policy designed to control spending and lower government debt. This policy",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "I would answer (D) the supply of money falls.\n\nWhen the supply of money decreases, it becomes scarcer and therefore more valuable. People hoard money when they feel like they might not be able to get their hands on enough of it in the future. If there is less money in circulation, people want more of it so that they're able to afford the things they want to buy. \nIn addition, when there's little money circulating, people are more worried about money losing value as so see it as an asset to own because they think it will gain value.",
