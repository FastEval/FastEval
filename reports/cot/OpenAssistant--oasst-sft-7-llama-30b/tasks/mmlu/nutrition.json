            "question": "Which foods tend to be consumed in lower quantities in Wales and Scotland (as of 2020)?\n\n\n(A) Meat\n(B) Confectionary\n(C) Fruits and vegetables\n(D) Potatoes",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(A) Meat\n\n* In Wales and Scotland, the consumption of meat has steadily decreased in recent years. This is likely due to a combination of factors, including changes in consumer preferences, concerns about the environmental impact of meat production, and economic factors such as an aging population and a decline in traditional industries.\n* While potatoes are a staple in many traditional Scottish and Welsh dishes, they are not typically consumed in smaller quantities compared to other countries. In fact, potatoes are a popular and readily available food in both Scotland and Wales.\n* Fruits and vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet, and while they are consumed in lower quantities in some parts of Scotland and Wales, this is not a characteristic that differentiates those regions from other areas where healthy eating habits may be more challenging to maintain.\n\n(D) Confectionary\n\n* Across the United Kingdom, confectionery is consumed in relatively high quantities, particularly among younger populations. However, it is not a food that is typically consumed in lower quantities in Scotland and Wales compared to other areas.\n* It is possible that in some regions, confectionery consumption may be influenced by factors such as economic and cultural differences, but this is not a general trend that can be attributed to entire countries or regions.",

            "question": "In which one of the following circumstances will the prevalence of a disease in the population increase, all else being constant?\n\n\n(A) If the incidence rate of the disease falls.\n(B) If survival time with the disease increases.\n(C) If recovery of the disease is faster.\n(D) If the population in which the disease is measured increases.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(D) If the population in which the disease is measured increases.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Prevalence is defined as the proportion of individuals who have a particular disease or health condition at a given point in time.\n* In other words, prevalence is the number of individuals with the disease relative to the total number of individuals in a population.\n* The scenario described in (D) implies an increase in both the numerator and denominator of the prevalence formula, resulting in an increase in prevalence.\n* On the other hand, if the incidence rate falls as described in (A), there are fewer individuals being affected by the disease. Therefore, the prevalence will decrease.\n* (B) and (C) are related to the survival and recovery of individuals who are already affected by the disease. If survival is increased as described in (B), there will be more survivors and the prevalence can also increase. However, if recovery is increased as described in (C), the number of individuals with the disease will decrease, and therefore the prevalence will also decrease.\n\nOverall, answering this question requires careful consideration of the underlying factors that affect prevalence, and analyzing the scenario descriptions to determine which one will result in an increase in prevalence under all else being constant.",

Flavonoids and isoflavonoids are both types of flavonoids, which are a group of plant pigments.\n* Statement B: The statement implies that the digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones in soya food products are not changed by processing. This is correct, as the digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones are not greatly affected by processing methods such as cooking or fermentation.\n* Statement C: The statement implies that both \u00df-carotene and lycopene can act as provitamin A. This is correct, as both \u00df-carotene and lycopene can be converted by the body into vitamin A, which is necessary for vision and cell growth.\n* Statement D: The statement implies that carotenoids and flavonoids are both classes of polyphenols. This is incorrect, as flavonoids are a subclass of polyphenols, but carotenoids are not. Carotenoids are a subclass of pigments, but flavonoids and polyphenols are both subclasses of tannins.\n\nIn summary, Statement A, B, and C are all correct, while Statement D is incorrect.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Answer: (A) Increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary life-style.\n\nExplanation: Obesity is a complex issue and there is no single cause that can be attributed to the obesity epidemic. However, it is widely accepted that the increase in energy intake and decrease in physical activity contribute to the rise in obesity rates.\n\nIn recent years, there have been significant changes in the dietary habits of individuals, with a greater proportion of the population consuming a diet that is high in energy-dense foods and beverages. This means that foods and drinks are often high in calories, sugar, and fat, but low in nutrients and fiber. Fast food, processed foods, and sugary drinks contribute to the high-energy diet.\n\nAt the same time, people are becoming more sedentary and engage in less physical activity. Many people spend several hours a day sitting, watching TV, or using their phones, computers, or other electronic devices. As a consequence, people are burning fewer calories and thus have a higher energy balance, which contributes to weight gain and obesity.\n\nThe importance of genetics and epigenetics in obesity should not be underestimated. However, it is not the only factor that contributes to the development of obesity, and the increase in energy intake and decreased physical activity seem to be the most important causes of the obesity epidemic.\n\nIn conclusion, obesity is a complex issue and its causes are varied. The rise in obesity rates over the past few decades is largely due to changes in dietary habits, physical activity levels, and genetics and epigenetics.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The effect of obesity on endometrial cancer is not directly mediated by hormones. Instead, obesity affects hormone balance indirectly by changing the amount and type of fat in the body. This can lead to insulin resistance, high levels of insulin, and a relative deficiency of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).\n\nObesity is thought to increase endometrial cancer risk through these mechanisms:\n\n* Insulin resistance and diabetes: Insulin resistance, often a consequence of obesity, can lead to high circulating levels of insulin. High insulin levels have been linked to an increased risk of endometrial cancer.\n\n* High estrogen levels: Obesity is associated with a relative deficiency of SHBG, a protein that binds to estrogen and other hormones in the blood. This can lead to an imbalance of sex hormones, with relatively high levels of circulating estrogen. High estrogen levels are thought to increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\n\nBecause of these indirect effects on hormone balance, the answer is likely to be (B) Oestrogen.",

While the requirements for adults are important, they may not be the same as those for infants and young children.\n(B) The amino acid requirements determined for adults is not assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages. While adults require amino acids for maintenance, their requirements may not be the same as those of infants and young children.\n(C) The amino acid pattern of breast milk is not assumed to be the requirement pattern for all children.
