However, there is no information provided in the question about which of these food items are consumed in lower quantities in these regions, so it is not possible to determine the correct answer to this question. Additionally, there is no indication that potatoes are consumed in higher quantities in these regions, so it is not correct to assume that they are consumed in higher quantities simply because they are commonly consumed there.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To understand the main causes of the obesity epidemic, it is necessary to consider the following factors:\n\n1. Dietary changes: In the last few decades, the diet of many populations has undergone significant changes, with an increase in the consumption of calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods. These foods are high in added sugars, saturated fats, and salt, and low in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. This change in diet has led to an increase in the overall energy density of food, making it easier to consume a large amount of calories in a short time.\n2. Sedentary lifestyle: Another factor contributing to the obesity epidemic is the decrease in physical activity levels. Many people lead sedentary lives, spending a significant amount of time sitting in front of screens, whether at work or at home. This lack of physical activity has led to a decline in energy expenditure, making it harder to burn off the excess calories consumed.\n3. Genetic factors: Changes in genetic profiles can also play a role in the obesity epidemic. The prevalence of certain genetic traits that predispose individuals to obesity has increased over time, making them more susceptible to gaining weight and struggling to maintain a healthy weight.\n\nAnswer: A (Increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary life-style) as it takes into account both changes in diet and sedentary lifestyle. B (Decreased leisure time activity) is not included as it is a subcategory of sedentary lifestyle. C (Changes in genetic profiles) is not a main cause but a contributing factor. D (None of the options given is correct) is not correct as all the options are relevant factors.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(D) The metabolic demand is fixed amount.\n\nExplanation:\nThe metabolic demand for amino acids is the requirement for amino acids to maintain protein turnover in the body. This demand is not solely supplied by the diet (A), but rather involves both dietary intake and endogenous production. The metabolic demand involves degradation of amino acids for energy production and other non-protein functions (C), but this is not strictly true. The metabolic demand also involves the adaption of amino acids by irreversible pathways. These pathways may be obligatory or adaptive degradation, nitrogen excretion, and energy production (C). However, degradation metabolism in basal conditions under normal physiological circumstances is adenosine triphosphate (ATP) - balanced, meaning degradation metabolism in basal conditions under normal physiological circumstances is adenosine triphosphate (ATP) - balanced . There are no adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -generating and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -consuming components of protein breakdown .
