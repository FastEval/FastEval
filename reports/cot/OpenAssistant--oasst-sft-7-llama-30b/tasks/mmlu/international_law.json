            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which state ordinarily exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels, we must consider the relevant international law and treaties.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate option (C) as it is not a widely accepted principle of international law.\n\nSecond, we must consider the flag state and the coastal state. The flag state is the state of registration of the vessel, while the coastal state is the state whose coast is nearest to the location of the crime.\n\nUnder the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the flag state and the coastal state have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed on board vessels in their respective exclusive economic zones, or the high seas if the crime is of a kind that involves a penal offence that is grave and constitutes a threat to the security of the ship, its crew, or its passengers.\n\nHowever, in practice, the flag state often exercises primary jurisdiction, especially if the offense was committed by or against a citizen of the flag state, or if the offense seriously affected the ship, its cargo, or its crew members.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) the flag state.",

Instead, it is found in a variety of sources such as statutes, common law, and conventions.\n* The UK Constitution is also a living constitution, which means it can change over time through judicial interpretation, legislative amendments, and evolving practices and conventions.\n* The source of power for the UK Constitution is not solely that of the sovereign (A), it gives the judiciary the power to overturn acts of parliament (B), nor is it based on a Bill of Rights (D).",

Examining the given options, we can eliminate them step by step until we reach the correct answer:\n\n1. Option (A) suggests that States are under a strict obligation to resolve their disputes as soon as possible, which is partially accurate but not comprehensive enough.\n2. Option (B) correctly states that the obligation is to try to resolve disputes through peaceful means, so it is partly correct.\n3. Option (C) is close, but it implies that the peaceful settlement of disputes concerns only State interests. This is not accurate, as we need to assess the obligation of all States, not only those involved in a specific dispute.\n4. Option (D) is incorrect, as the peaceful settlement of disputes refers to a broader principle that involves all States, not only international courts and tribunals.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and its definition of rocks. The UNCLOS is an international treaty that regulates various aspects of ocean law, including navigation, fishing, oil and gas exploration, and territorial zones.\n\nThe definition of \"rock\" under UNCLOS is not straightforward, and it depends on various factors. The four options given appear to be based on different criteria:\n\n* Option (A) states that rocks are islands that are less than 10 square miles. The UNCLOS does not explicitly define rocks, but according to Article 121, \"Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.\" The size of an island is not a determining factor, and it is possible for an island to be less than 10 square miles and still sustain human habitation or economic life.\n* Option (B) states that rocks are the islands that do not have any maritime zone. This is not accurate because every state has coastal and exclusive economic zones, regardless of the size or status of its islands or rocks. Therefore, a rock that is unable to sustain human habitation or economic life but still has a maritime zone would still be considered a rock.\n* Option (C) is the correct answer. According to Article 121 (3) of the UNCLOS, \"Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.\" This definition applies to rocks, but not to islands, which can be classified as rocks that do not meet the criteria of the UNCLOS, such as those without a maritime zone. As a result, Option (D) is false since small islands can sustain human habitation and economic life but still be classified as rocks.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAnswer: (C) The rock is an island that cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of its own and according to article 121 (3) of UNCLOS has no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.\n\n[ ]",
