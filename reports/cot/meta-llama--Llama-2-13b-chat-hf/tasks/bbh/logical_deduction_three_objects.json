This means that the blue jay must be on the left side of the branch, and the falcon must be on the right side of the branch.\n2. The blue jay is to the right of the quail. This means that the quail must be on the left side of the branch, and the blue jay must be on the right side of the branch.\n3. The quail is not the second from the left. The second from the left would be the blue jay, since it is to the right of the quail.\n4.
