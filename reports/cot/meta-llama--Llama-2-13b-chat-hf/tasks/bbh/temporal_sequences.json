Ashley saw Richard working at the office from 2pm to 4pm.\n5. Hannah saw Richard fixing their computer at the electronic store from 4pm to 8pm.\n6. The physics classroom was closed after 8pm.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information and find the time window when Richard could have gone to the physics classroom.\n\nFirst, we know that Richard was not at the physics classroom during the times he was at the library (10am-11am), on the rooftop (11am-2pm), or at the office (2pm-4pm) because we have evidence that he was somewhere else during those times.\n\nSecond, we know that the physics classroom was closed after 8pm, so Richard could not have gone there after that time.\n\nThird, we know that Richard was at the electronic store from 4pm to 8pm, so he could not have gone to the physics classroom during that time either.\n\nNow, we are left with two possible time windows:\n\n1. 7am to 10am\n2. 2pm to 4pm\n\nSince Richard was not at the physics classroom during the times he was at the library, on the rooftop, or at the office, we can eliminate option (C) 11am to 2pm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B) 2pm to 4pm.\n\nThe answer is (B).",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! To find out when Linda could have gone to the beach, we need to look at the information we have and figure out when she was free.\n\nLet's start by looking at the first piece of information: Linda woke up at 10am. So, we know that she was awake and probably getting ready to start her day at 10am.\n\nNext, we have the information that Elizabeth saw Linda waiting at the train station from 10am to 12pm. This means that Linda must have been at the train station during that time, and she couldn't have been at the beach during that time.\n\nNow, let's look at the next piece of information: David saw Linda working at the office from 2pm to 4pm. This means that Linda was at the office during that time, and she couldn't have been at the beach during that time either.\n\nNext, we have the information that Sarah saw Linda waiting at the airport from 4pm to 5pm. This means that Linda must have been at the airport during that time, and she couldn't have been at the beach during that time.\n\nFinally, we have the information that Ashley saw Linda attending class at the school from 5pm to 9pm. This means that Linda was at school during that time, and she couldn't have been at the beach during that time.\n\nNow that we've looked at all of the information, we can see that the only time when Linda was not at the train station, the office, the airport, or school, was between 9pm and 10pm. That's when she was walking in the garden.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is:\n\n(A) 12pm to 2pm\n\nBecause Linda was at the train station from 10am to 12pm, and she couldn't have been at the beach during that time.\n\nI hope that helps!
