You have two tables, one with penguins and one with giraffes. The penguins table has four rows, with each row showing the name, age, height, and weight of a penguin. The giraffes table has five rows, with the same information for each giraffe.\n\nNow, let's focus on the giraffes table. We can see that the ages of the giraffes range from 2 to 10 years old, and their heights range from 310 to 440 cm. We can also see that the weights of the giraffes range from 410 to 650 kg.\n\nTo find the cumulative age of the giraffes, we need to add up all of their ages. Let's do this by adding the ages of each giraffe, one by one.\n\nFirst, we'll start with Jody, who is 5 years old. So, the cumulative age of the giraffes is 5.\n\nNext, we'll add Gladys' age of 10 years, which brings the cumulative age to 15.\n\nThen, we'll add Marian's age of 2 years, which brings the cumulative age to 17.\n\nNext, we'll add Donna's age of 9 years, which brings the cumulative age to 26.\n\nTherefore, the cumulative age of the giraffes is 26.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (A) 26.\n\nI hope this helps!

The penguins table has four penguins, and the giraffes table has five giraffes. You want to know the name of the last giraffe in the table.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the penguins table. The first line is a header, so we can ignore it. The next four lines list the name, age, height, and weight of four penguins.\n\nNow, let's move on to the giraffes table. The first line is also a header, so we can ignore it. The next five lines list the name, age, height, and weight of five giraffes.\n\nGreat! Now that we have looked at both tables, we can answer the question. The last giraffe in the table is the one listed in the fifth line of the giraffes table.\n\nSo, the name of the last giraffe is... (D) Donna.\n\nIs there anything else you would like to know?",
