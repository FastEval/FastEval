We can also eliminate option (D) as there is no indication in the passage that Huxley believed in supernatural phenomena.\n\nNow, let's consider options (A) and (C). Option (A) suggests that life is a force that works through matter, which is consistent with Huxley's argument that life has a physical basis. Option (C) suggests that life is merely a property of a certain kind of matter, which is also consistent with Huxley's argument that the physical basis of life breaks down into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which are ordinary matter.\n\nTherefore, based on the passage, the best answer is (C) merely a property of a certain kind of matter.\n\nSo, the answer is (C).",

While it is true that religious worship in ancient Rome varied with one's social position, it was not decentralized. The Roman state had an official religion, and there were established temples and rituals that were widely followed.\n\n(B) In ancient Rome, religious worship was the source of much social tension and turmoil.\n\nThis option is not entirely accurate either. While there may have been some social tension and turmoil related to religious worship in ancient Rome, it is not the primary interpretation of Gibbon's quote. The quote suggests that religious worship was generally seen as useful by the magistrate, rather than a source of conflict.\n\n(C) In ancient Rome, religious worship was homogeneous and highly centralized.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Gibbon's quote suggests the opposite - that religious worship in ancient Rome was diverse and varied.\n\n(D) In ancient Rome, religious worship was revolutionized by the introduction of Christianity.\n\nThis option is not relevant to the quote, as it does not mention Christianity at all.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n(A) In ancient Rome, religious worship was decentralized and tended to vary with one's social position.\n\nI hope this breakdown and answer are helpful!",

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.",

The author, Duke Saint-Simon, highlights the king's tendency to expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, and his quickness to notice the absence of those of inferior degree. This suggests that the author may have a negative view of the king's authoritarian and controlling behavior.\n\nFurthermore, the document states that the king made expensive habits the fashion, and compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, gradually reducing them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.
