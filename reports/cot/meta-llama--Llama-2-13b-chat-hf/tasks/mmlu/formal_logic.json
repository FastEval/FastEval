            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my step-by-step reasoning and the answer:\n\n1. The passage states that \"it is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients.\" This implies that the speaker has observed a similarity between the emotional responses of their peers and their everyday patients, and this similarity makes it difficult to verify the weakened intelligence in their peers.\n2. The next sentence states that \"the arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.\" This suggests that the speaker believes that their own consciousness, or their peers', may be clouding their judgment and making it difficult to recognize the weakened intelligence due to emotions.\n3. The third sentence states that \"because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\" This sentence connects the previous two sentences and emphasizes the difficulty of persuading people of the existence of unconscious motivations when they are unaware of them.\n\nBased on these three sentences, the conclusion of the argument is:\n\n(C) Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C).",
