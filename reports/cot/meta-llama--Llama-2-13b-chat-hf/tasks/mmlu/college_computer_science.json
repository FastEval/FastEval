It involves assigning a set of permissions to each user or group, and then using these permissions to determine whether a user or group has access to a particular resource.\n\nHowever, one difficulty with the access matrix approach is that it can become unwieldy when dealing with complex protection requirements. This is because the access matrix can become very large and difficult to manage, especially when there are many users and resources to consider.\n\nFor example, if we have a system with many users and a large number of resources, the access matrix can quickly become cluttered and difficult to interpret. This can make it difficult to ensure that the appropriate users have access to the resources they need, while keeping unauthorized users out.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is the correct answer. The access matrix approach is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements, and it can become unwieldy when dealing with a large number of users and resources.\n\nThe answer to the question is: (B) it is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements.",

Both versions have a disk seek time of 25 milliseconds. \ud83d\udd01\n\nStep 2: Disk Latency Time\n\nThe disk latency time also does not change between version 1 and version 2, so it does not affect the ratio.

Resolution is a proof system for propositional logic that is based on the idea of resolving two clauses that have a common subformula. The Resolution theorem states that if a formula cannot be resolved into a contradiction, then it is satisfiable.\n\nNow, let's look at the properties of the Resolution theorem:\n\nI. Soundness: Is the Resolution theorem a sound proof system? In other words, if a formula has a resolution proof, does that mean it is unsatisfiable?\n\nWell, the Resolution theorem is not sound, because it is possible to have a satisfiable formula with a resolution proof. For example, consider the formula (p \u2227 \u00acq) \u2227 (q \u2227 \u00acr). This formula is satisfiable, but it has a resolution proof that shows it is unsatisfiable. So, the Resolution theorem is not sound.\n\nII. Completeness: Is the Resolution theorem a complete proof system? In other words, does it provide a proof of unsatisfiability for every unsatisfiable formula?\n\nWell, the Resolution theorem is not complete, because there are unsatisfiable formulas that cannot be proven to be unsatisfiable using the Resolution theorem. For example, consider the formula (p \u2227 \u00acq) \u2227 (q \u2227 \u00acr). This formula is unsatisfiable, but it cannot be proven to be unsatisfiable using the Resolution theorem. So, the Resolution theorem is not complete.\n\nIII. Succinctness: Is the Resolution theorem a succinct proof system? In other words, does it provide a proof of unsatisfiability in a polynomial amount of time?\n\nWell, the Resolution theorem is not succinct, because it can take an exponential amount of time to provide a proof of unsatisfiability. For example, consider the formula (p \u2227 \u00acq) \u2227 (q \u2227 \u00acr). This formula has a resolution proof, but the proof is not polynomial in the length of the formula. So, the Resolution theorem is not succinct.\n\nBased on these properties, we can see that the Resolution theorem has none of the properties (I, II, III).

Therefore, statement I is NOT a property of a purely segmented memory system.\n\nII. It permits implementation of virtual memory.\n\nVirtual memory is a memory management technique that allows a computer to use more memory than is physically available. A purely segmented memory system does not permit the implementation of virtual memory, as it does not support the concept of page tables or other virtual memory data structures. Therefore, statement II is NOT a property of a purely segmented memory system.\n\nIII.

Let me explain my reasoning step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement (A): \"It is inherently nonassociative because some numbers have no exact representation.\" This statement is true. Floating-point arithmetic is based on a representation of numbers using a fractional part and an integer part, and not all numbers can be exactly represented in this format. For example, the number 0.1 cannot be exactly represented as a binary floating-point number, because it has an infinite number of fractional digits. Therefore, statement (A) is correct.\n\nNext, let's consider statement (B): \"It is inherently nonassociative because there have to be upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers.\" This statement is false. While it is true that floating-point numbers have a limited range of values, this does not mean that they are inherently nonassociative. In fact, many floating-point arithmetic operations can be performed associatively, just like integer arithmetic operations. Therefore, statement (B) is not correct.\n\nNow let's consider statement (C): \"Associativity can be achieved with appropriate roundoff conventions.\" This statement is partially correct. While it is true that roundoff conventions can be used to ensure associativity in certain situations, this is not always possible. For example, when rounding a sum of two large numbers to the same number of significant digits, the associative property may not hold. Therefore, while statement (C) is partially correct, it is not a complete statement of the associativity properties of floating-point arithmetic.\n\nFinally, let's consider statement (D): \"Some rational numbers have no exact representation.\" This statement is true. Not all rational numbers can be exactly represented as floating-point numbers, because some have infinite or repetitive decimal expansions that cannot be captured exactly using a finite number of digits.

These dangling links will continue to point to the deleted file, but the files will no longer exist on the disk. This can lead to problems such as data inconsistency and corruption, as well as confusion for other users who may still be using the dangling links to access the deleted files.\n\nTherefore, the primary drawback to this approach to sharing is that it does not provide any mechanism for handling the deletion of shared files, which can result in dangling links and other problems.\n\nAnswer: (C) If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.\n\nI hope this helps!
