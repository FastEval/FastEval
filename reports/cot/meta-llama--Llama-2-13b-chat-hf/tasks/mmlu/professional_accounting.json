If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Certainly! I'd be happy to help you with this question.\n\nTo start, let's break down the information we have:\n\n1. You bought a limousine for $98,000.\n2. You plan to rent it out for weddings, ceremonies, and parties at $245 per hour.\n3. You estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average.\n4. Daily costs are estimated to be about $50.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use this information to estimate the yearly yield on your investment.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the daily revenue\n\nTo do this, we need to multiply the number of hours the limousine will be hired per day by the hourly rental rate:\n\n2 hours/day x $245/hour = $490/day\n\nStep 2: Calculate the annual revenue\n\nTo calculate the annual revenue, we need to multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in a year:\n\n$490/day x 365 days/year (accounting for leap years) = $174,850/year\n\nStep 3: Calculate the daily cost\n\nAs you mentioned, daily costs are estimated to be about $50. So, we can simply multiply the number of days the limousine will be hired per year by the daily cost:\n\n365 days/year x $50/day = $18,250/year\n\nStep 4: Calculate the annual yield\n\nNow, we can calculate the annual yield by subtracting the daily cost from the annual revenue:\n\n$174,850/year - $18,250/year = $156,600/year\n\nSo, the estimated yearly yield on your investment would be $156,600.\n\nAnd the answer is... (D) 183%.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the calculation, and please let me know if you have any further questions!",

The merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory, so we know that the inventory balance is accurate.\n2. However, the purchase of the merchandise was not recorded in the accounting records, which means that the accounts payable balance is not accurate.\n3. If the purchase was not recorded, then the accounts payable balance will be understated, because the purchase was made but not recorded.\n4. Since the inventory balance is accurate, but the accounts payable balance is understated, this means that the asset (inventory) is overstated and the liability (accounts payable) is understated.\n5.

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's review the definitions of the terms we're dealing with:\n\n* Nonsampling risk: The risk that the auditor will not identify material misstatements in the financial statements, even if they exist.\n* Sampling risk: The risk that the auditor will not detect material misstatements in the financial statements because of the limited nature of the sample.\n\nNow, let's examine each of the options:\n\n(A) Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Nonsampling risk is not related to the size of the sample or the fact that the auditor is only testing a portion of the population. Nonsampling risk is the risk that the auditor will not identify material misstatements, regardless of the sampling method used.\n\n(B) Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\n\nThis option is incorrect as well. Nonsampling risk is not caused by the auditor's failure to recognize misstatements. Instead, it is the risk that the auditor will not identify material misstatements, even if they exist.\n\n(C) Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\n\nThis option is partially correct. Sampling risk is indeed derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks. However, this is not the only source of sampling risk.\n\n(D) Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Sampling risk is not related to the selection of audit procedures. Instead, it is the risk that the auditor will not detect material misstatements in the financial statements because of the limited nature of the sample.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\n\nI hope that helps!

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nWhen it comes to subsequent events, an auditor's primary goal is to ensure that the financial statements being audited accurately reflect the current financial position and performance of the entity. To do this, the auditor would need to identify and assess any events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements were issued.\n\nSo, let's analyze the options given:\n\n(A) Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end.\n\nThis option does not relate to subsequent events. Inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end are not considered subsequent events, as they were existing assets of the entity at the balance sheet date. Therefore, this option is not the correct procedure for an auditor regarding subsequent events.\n\n(B) Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate.\n\nThis option is not correct either. Internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate are not considered subsequent events. An auditor's evaluation of internal controls is an essential part of the audit process, but it is not related to subsequent events.\n\n(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\n\nNow we're getting closer! Reviewing the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end is an appropriate procedure for an auditor regarding subsequent events. This is because the auditor needs to ensure that any transactions or events that occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements were issued are properly accounted for and reflected in the financial statements.\n\n(D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.\n\nThis option is not the correct procedure for an auditor regarding subsequent events. Interim financial statements are not directly related to subsequent events, as they provide a snapshot of the entity's financial position and performance at a point in time during the year. While comparing interim financial statements with the statements being audited can be useful in assessing the entity's performance and financial position over time, it is not directly relevant to subsequent events.\n\nTherefore, the correct procedure for an auditor regarding subsequent events is to review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\n\nAnd the answer is (C).",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the present value of the profits in year five and year ten using a discount rate of 10%. The formula for calculating the present value of a future cash flow is:\n\nPV = CF / (1 + r)^n\n\nwhere:\n\nPV = present value\nCF = future cash flow\nr = discount rate (10% in this case)\nn = number of periods until the cash flow (5 years for year 5, 10 years for year 10)\n\nSo, using this formula, we can calculate the present value of the profits in year five as follows:\n\nPV of year 5 profit = $500 / (1 + 0.10)^5 = $356.28\n\nAnd the present value of the profits in year ten as follows:\n\nPV of year 10 profit = $500 / (1 + 0.10)^10 = $241.03\n2. Next, we need to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the investment project. The NPV is the sum of the present values of all future cash flows minus the initial investment. In this case, the initial investment is $500, and the present values of the profits in years five and ten are $356.28 and $241.03, respectively.\n\nSo, the NPV of the investment project is:\n\nNPV = $500 - $356.28 - $241.03 = $\u22123\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) \u2212$3.\n\nI hope this helps!

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Certainly! I'd be happy to help you with your question.\n\nTo begin with, let's review the information given in the question:\n\n* The bonds were issued at a premium on July 1 of year 7.\n* The bonds have a due date of July 1 of year 12.\n* Dean incorrectly used the straight-line method to amortize the premium instead of the effective interest method.\n\nNow, let's think about how this error might affect the bond carrying amount and retained earnings at June 30 of year 12.\n\n1. Bond carrying amount:\n\nWhen Dean prematurely uses the straight-line method to amortize the premium, it results in an understatement of the bond carrying amount. This is because the straight-line method allocates the premium over the life of the bond using a constant rate, whereas the effective interest method would calculate the amortization based on the bond's effective interest rate.\n\nSo, at June 30 of year 12, the bond carrying amount would likely be higher than it should be, due to the understatement of the premium.\n\n2. Retained earnings:\n\nThe incorrect use of the straight-line method would also affect the retained earnings. Since the premium is understated, the interest expense would be lower than it should be, which would lead to an overstatement of retained earnings.\n\nSo, at June 30 of year 12, the retained earnings would likely be higher than they should be, due to the overstatement of interest expense.\n\nNow, let's determine the answer to your question. Based on the information provided, we can conclude that:\n\n(B) The retained earnings would be overstated, and the bond carrying amount would be understated.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).\n\nI hope this explanation helps!

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my step-by-step reasoning, and the final answer will be at the end.\n\nSo, we have a three-year bond with a face value of $100, and it's paying 5% coupons. This means that every year, the bond will pay $5 in interest, based on the face value of $100.\n\nNow, the yield of the bond is 6%. This means that the bond is expected to return 6% of the purchase price each year, in the form of interest payments.\n\nTo calculate the price of the bond, we can use the present value of the bond's future cash flows. The present value is the amount of money that we would need to invest today, in order to receive the same amount of money in the future, adjusted for the time value of money.\n\nThe time value of money is based on the idea that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future, because we can invest the dollar today and earn interest on it. This means that we can use a formula to calculate the present value of the bond's future cash flows, based on the interest rate and the time period.\n\nThe formula we use is:\n\nPresent Value = Future Value / (1 + Interest Rate)^Years\n\nIn this case, the future value is the face value of the bond, which is $100. The interest rate is 5%, or 0.05. The years is 3, because the bond has a 3-year term.\n\nSo, let's plug in the numbers and calculate the present value of the bond:\n\nPresent Value = $100 / (1 + 0.05)^3\n\nPresent Value = $100 / 1.15\n\nPresent Value = $87.06\n\nThis means that the price of the bond, based on the present value of its future cash flows, is $87.06.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the price of the bond, based on the yield of 6%. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nPrice = Face Value / (Yield - Interest Rate)\n\nIn this case, the face value is $100, the yield is 6%, or 0.06, and the interest rate is 5%, or 0.05.\n\nSo, let's plug in the numbers and calculate the price of the bond:\n\nPrice = $100 / (0.06 - 0.05)\n\nPrice = $100 / 0.01\n\nPrice = $10,000\n\nThis means that the price of the bond, based on the yield of 6%, is $10,000.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n(D) $10,000",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to determine how much of the corporation's taxable income ($400,000) is passive income, which is not subject to self-employment tax. Since Carson owned 40% of the outstanding stock, we can assume that 40% of the corporation's taxable income is passive income.\n\nPassive income = 40% of $400,000 = $160,000\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate the amount of self-employment tax that Carson would owe on the remaining amount of taxable income. Since the corporation is a C corporation, the self-employment tax rate is 15.3% (15.3% x $240,000 = $36,420).\n\nSelf-employment tax = 15.3% of $240,000 = $36,420\n\n3. Now, we need to subtract the passive income from the total taxable income to get the amount of taxable income that is subject to self-employment tax.\n\nTaxable income subject to self-employment tax = $240,000 - $160,000 = $80,000\n\n4. Finally, we can calculate the amount of gross income that Carson would report on their individual tax return by adding the passive income and the self-employment tax.\n\nGross income = $160,000 + $36,420 = $196,420\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) $196,420.\n\nI hope this helps!
