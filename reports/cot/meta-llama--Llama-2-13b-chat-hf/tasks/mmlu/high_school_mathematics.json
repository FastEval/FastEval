So, the probability of him choosing an apple is 1/3.\n2. Now, let's say that he chooses an orange on the second meal (lunch). The probability of him choosing an orange is also 1/3, since he has an equal probability of choosing any of the three fruits.\n3. For the third meal (dinner), let's say that he chooses a banana. Again, the probability of him choosing a banana is 1/3.\n4. Now, we need to find the probability that Joe will eat at least two different kinds of fruit.

However, we want to find the probability of Joe eating at least two different kinds of fruit on this given day. So, we need to find the probability of him eating two different kinds of fruit on this day, and then add that to the probability of him eating three different kinds of fruit.\n6. To find the probability of Joe eating two different kinds of fruit on this day, we need to calculate the probability of him choosing each fruit on the first two meals, and then finding the intersection of those probabilities.\n7.

Next, let's use the information about the function's properties to constrain the possible values of $f(1)$:\n\t* Since the graph of $y = f(x)$ lies below the line segment between $(-2, 5)$ and $(2, 9)$, we know that the graph must be below the line $y = 5$ for all $x$ between $-2$ and $2$.\n\t* Moreover, since the function is strictly convex, the graph must be below the line $y = x + 5$ for all $x$ between $-2$ and $2$.\n3.

The question asks for the number of arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240.\n2. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the previous term.\n3. Consecutive odd integers are integers that have a difference of 2, such as 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on.\n4. To find the number of arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240, we need to count the number of ways we can choose a starting value and a common difference such that the sequence sums to 240.\n5. Let's assume we have an arithmetic sequence of consecutive odd integers with a starting value of $a$ and a common difference of $d$. The first term of the sequence is $a$, and the second term is $a + d$.\n6. We want the sequence to sum to 240, so we can set up the equation:\n\n$$a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + ... + (a + (d-1)d) = 240$$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$$a + a + d + 2d + ... + (d-1)d = 240$$\n\nThinking about the patterns in the equation, we can see that each term is the same, except for the first term.
