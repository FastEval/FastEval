I'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nTo begin, let's examine the given expression p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) in S_5.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the order of the elements in the expression. The order of elements in a permutation is important, as it affects the final index of the permutation.\n\nBased on the expression, we can see that the elements are arranged in the following order:\n\n1, 2, 5, 4, 2, 3\n\nNow, we need to find the index of p in S_5. To do this, we need to count the number of permutations in S_5 that have the same elements as p.\n\nLet's start by counting the number of permutations in S_5 that have the first element 1.\n\nThere are 5 choices for the first element, so there are 5 permutations in S_5 that have the first element 1.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of permutations in S_5 that have the second element 2.\n\nThere are 4 choices for the second element, since the first element is already fixed as 1, so there are 4 permutations in S_5 that have the second element 2.\n\nNow, we need to count the number of permutations in S_5 that have the third element 5.\n\nThere are 3 choices for the third element, since the first two elements are already fixed as 1 and 2, so there are 3 permutations in S_5 that have the third element 5.\n\nFinally, we need to count the number of permutations in S_5 that have the fourth element 4.\n\nThere are 2 choices for the fourth element, since the first three elements are already fixed as 1, 2, and 5, so there are 2 permutations in S_5 that have the fourth element 4.\n\nNow that we have counted the number of permutations in S_5 that have each of the elements in p, we can find the index of p in S_5.\n\nTo do this, we need to divide the total number of permutations in S_5 by the number of permutations that have each of the elements in p.\n\nThere are a total of 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120 permutations in S_5.\n\nThe number of permutations in S_5 that have the first element 1 is 5, the number of permutations that have the second element 2 is 4, the number of permutations that have the third element 5 is 3, and the number of permutations that have the fourth element 4 is 2.\n\nSo, the total number of permutations in S_5 that have the same elements as p is:\n\n5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 120\n\nTherefore, the index of p in S_5 is:\n\n120 / 5! = 24\n\nThe answer is (C) 24.\n\nI hope this helps!

Here's my step-by-step explanation:\n\nStatement 1:\n\nA factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.\n\nTo determine if this statement is true or false, we need to consider what a factor group is and what it means for a group to be non-Abelian.\n\nA factor group is a subgroup of a group that contains all the elements of the original group that can be expressed as the product of two elements of the subgroup, with the property that the order of the factors does not matter. In other words, if we have a group G and a subset H of G, then H is a factor group of G if every element of G can be written as the product of an element of H and another element of H, and the order in which we multiply the elements does not affect the result.\n\nA group is non-Abelian if it is not Abelian, meaning that the order in which we multiply elements matters. This means that the product of two elements of a non-Abelian group is not necessarily the same as the product of the same elements in a different order.\n\nNow, let's consider whether the statement \"A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian\" is true or false. If we have a non-Abelian group G and a factor group H of G, then every element of G can be written as the product of an element of H and another element of H, and the order in which we multiply the elements does not affect the result. This means that H is also a non-Abelian group, since the order in which we multiply elements matters. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nStatement 2:\n\nIf K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nTo determine if this statement is true or false, we need to consider what it means for a subgroup to be normal. A subgroup K of a group G is normal if it satisfies the following two properties:\n\n1. K is invariant under conjugation by any element of G, meaning that if we take any element g of G and any element k of K, then the conjugate of k by g, denoted by gkg^(-1), is also an element of K.\n2. The intersection of K with any conjugate of K by any element of G is not empty.\n\nNow, let's consider whether the statement \"If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G\" is true or false. If we have a subgroup K of a group G, and K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G. This is because K is invariant under conjugation by any element of G, since H is invariant under conjugation by any element of G and K is contained in H. Additionally, the intersection of K with any conjugate of K by any element of G is not empty, since the intersection of K with H is not empty and H is invariant under conjugation by any element of G. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nNow, based on the above explanations, the answers to the statements are:\n\nStatement 1: True\nStatement 2: True\n\nSo, the correct answer is (A) True, True.",

An element of order 15 means that the element has 15 as its order, which means that the element has 15 distinct powers (in other words, 15 times the element raised to different powers).\n\nNow, let's think about why this statement must be true. If a group has an element of order 15, then it must have at least one element that has order 15, since the order of an element is always a positive integer and cannot be negative or zero.\n\nFurthermore, if a group has an element of order 15, then it must have at least two distinct elements of order 15, since the order of an element cannot be equal to the order of another element in the same group. This is because if two elements have the same order, then they must be equal, which means that the group does not have distinct elements of order 15.\n\nSo, if a group has an element of order 15, then it must have at least 2 elements of order 15, and therefore at least 8 elements of order 15 (since 2 times 4 is 8).\n\nStatement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nThis statement is similar to the first statement, but it deals with groups that have more than 8 elements of order 15.\n\nIf a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, then it must have at least 9 elements of order 15 (since 9 is greater than 8).\n\nNow, let's think about why this statement must be true.

To understand this statement, we need to know what a homomorphic image and a factor group are.\n\nA homomorphic image of a group G is a group that is obtained by applying a homomorphism (a function that preserves the group operation) to G. In other words, it is a group that is \"similar\" to G in some sense.\n\nA factor group of G, on the other hand, is a group that is formed by identifying certain elements of G as \"equivalent\" or \"alike\" in some way.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is saying that every homomorphic image of G is equivalent to a factor group of G.\n\nStatement 2 says that the homomorphic images of G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G. This means that if we have two groups, one that is a homomorphic image of G, and the other that is a factor group of G, then they are essentially the same group, but with possibly different naming conventions or ways of describing the elements.\n\nNow, let's think about how these two statements relate to each other. If we have a group G, then we can form its homomorphic images and factor groups, and these two types of groups are related in some way.\n\nSo, the question is, are the two statements True or False?\n\nWell, to answer this, we need to carefully consider the relationship between homomorphic images and factor groups.\n\nIn general, we can say that every factor group of a group G is a homomorphic image of G, but not all homomorphic images of G are factor groups of G.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Statement 1 is True, because every homomorphic image of G is a factor group of G, but Statement 2 is False, because not all factor groups of G are homomorphic images of G.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is (C) True, False.",

If every non-zero element maps to a non-zero element, then the homomorphism is one to one.\n\nThe kernel of a ring homomorphism is the set of all elements of the domain ring that map to 0 in the codomain ring.

We can do this by factoring the polynomial equation that defines the field extension:\n\nQ(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) = {a + bsqrt(2) + csqrt(3)| a, b, c \u2208 Q, b^2 + 2c^2 = 0}\n\nSince b^2 + 2c^2 = 0, we know that b = 0 or c = 0. Therefore, the prime factors of Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) are Q and the prime ideal generated by square roots of 2 and 3.\n\nStep 2: Determine the degree of the prime ideal\n\nNext, we need to determine the degree of the prime ideal generated by square roots of 2 and 3. This can be done by computing theheight of the ideal, which is the maximum number of variables that occur in the generators of the ideal with nonzero coefficients.\n\nThe generators of the prime ideal are square roots of 2 and 3, which can be written as:\n\nsqrt(2) = a + bsqrt(3)\nsqrt(3) = c + dsqrt(2)\n\nSince the coefficients a, b, c, and d are all nonzero, we see that the height of the ideal is 2. Therefore, the degree of the prime ideal is 2.\n\nStep 3: Find the degree of the field extension\n\nFinally, we can find the degree of the field extension by adding the degrees of the prime ideals that generate the extension field. Since the degree of the prime ideal generated by square roots of 2 and 3 is 2, and the degree of the prime ideal generated by square roots of 2 is 1 (since Q(sqrt(2)) = Q(2)), we see that the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is:\n\ndeg(Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))/Q) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is 3.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is:\n\n(C) 3\n\nI hope my explanation was helpful!
