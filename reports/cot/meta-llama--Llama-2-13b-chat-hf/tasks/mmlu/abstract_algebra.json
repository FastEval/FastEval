In other words, if we have two groups G and H, such that H is a normal subgroup of G (i.e., H is a subset of G that is closed under the group operation of G and contains the identity element of G), then we can form a quotient group G/H, which consists of all cosets of H in G.\n\nA group is said to be non-Abelian if it does not satisfy the Abelian property, which states that the order of the elements in a product does not matter. In other words, if we have a group G and two elements a and b in G, then ab = ba if and only if a and b commute with each other.\n\nNow, let's apply this to Statement 1. If we have a non-Abelian group G, then any factor group of G, such as G/H, is also non-Abelian. This is because the Abelian property does not hold in G, so it cannot hold in G/H either. Therefore, Statement 1 is True.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nThis statement is True because if K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G. The reason for this is that normal subgroups are closed under intersection, so K \u2229 H is a normal subgroup of both K and H, and hence of G as well.

Here's my step-by-step reasoning for the given statements:\n\nStatement 1: If a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15.\n\nTo understand why this statement is true, let's consider the definition of an element of order 15. An element x in a group G is said to have order 15 if the only ways to compute x^n, for n = 0, 1, 2, ..., 14, are x^0 = e, x^1 = x, x^2 = x^2, ..., x^14 = x^14, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, suppose G has an element x of order 15. Since x has order 15, we know that x^n = x for all n = 0, 1, 2, ..., 14. Therefore, any element y in G that is not the identity element must have order at most 14, since y^n = x^n for all n = 0, 1, 2, ..., 14.\n\nIn other words, if G has an element of order 15, then every element in G except the identity element must have order at most 14. Since there are at least 8 elements in G (the identity element and 7 elements of order 14), we must have at least 8 elements of order 15.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nTo prove this statement, suppose G has more than 8 elements of order 15. Let's assume there are exactly 9 elements in G that have order 15. We know that each of these elements must have a different order, since the only way to have the same order is if there is a non-trivial normal subgroup of G, which is impossible since G is a group.\n\nNow, consider the set S = {x^i : i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 14}, where x is any one of the 9 elements of order 15 in G. Since S contains all the elements of G, we must have |S| = 16.\n\nTherefore, if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, then it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n(D) False, True",

Here's my step-by-step explanation of the statements:\n\nStatement 1: Every homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphic to a factor group of G.\n\nFirst, let's define what a homomorphic image and a factor group are. A homomorphic image of a group G is a group that is derived from G by some homomorphism (i.e., a function) that maps G to another group. A factor group of G, on the other hand, is a group that is isomorphic to a quotient of G (i.e., a group that is formed by identifying certain elements of G as \"equivalent\" and forming a new group that contains only one representative from each equivalence class).\n\nNow, let's consider the statement. It says that every homomorphic image of G is isomorphic to a factor group of G. This means that if we have a homomorphism from G to some other group H, then we can form a factor group of G that is isomorphic to H.\n\nThe reason why this is true is that the homomorphism from G to H can be thought of as a projection of G onto a subspace of H, where the subspace consists of all elements of H that are mapped to by the homomorphism. This subspace is isomorphic to a factor group of G, since it contains all the elements of G that are mapped to by the homomorphism, and the operations in the subspace are the same as the operations in G. Therefore, the homomorphic image of G in H is isomorphic to the factor group of G.\n\nStatement 2: The homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G.\n\nThis statement is saying that the homomorphic images of G are all \"the same\" in the sense that they are all isomorphic to each other, and they are all isomorphic to some factor group of G.\n\nTo see why this is true, imagine that we have a homomorphism from G to some other group H, and we form the factor group of G as described above. Then, we can form another homomorphism from G to another group K, and form the factor group of G with respect to this homomorphism as well.\n\nSince the two homomorphisms are both mapping G to different groups, the two factor groups of G that we obtain are clearly different groups. However, they are isomorphic to each other, since they both contain all the elements of G that are mapped to by the homomorphism, and they both have the same operations. Therefore, the homomorphic images of G are all isomorphic to each other, and they are all isomorphic to some factor group of G.\n\nSo, to summarize, the answer to both statements is (C) True, False.
