An unbiased estimator is an estimator that has a expected value equal to the true value of the parameter being estimated.\n\nLinear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The linear regression estimator is the estimated value of the regression equation, which is the best linear prediction of the dependent variable based on the independent variables.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the linear regression estimator is an unbiased estimator because it is based on a sample of data and is designed to provide an unbiased estimate of the true value of the regression equation.\n\nTherefore, statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\n\nTo determine whether this statement is true or false, we need to understand what AdaBoost is and what is meant by \"coefficients \u03b1.\"\n\nAdaBoost is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by iteratively training decision trees to correct the errors made by the previous tree. The coefficients \u03b1 are the weights assigned to each classifier in the ensemble.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the coefficients \u03b1 are always non-negative because AdaBoost is designed to reduce the error of the previous tree by assigning more weight to the misclassified samples. This means that the coefficients \u03b1 will always be positive or zero, never negative.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n(A) True, True",

Statement 1: RoBERTa pretrains on a corpus that is approximate 10x larger than the corpus BERT pretrained on.\n\nThis statement is true. RoBERTa was pretrained on a larger corpus than BERT, specifically the Buffoon dataset which is approximately 10 times larger than the BookCorpus dataset used for BERT.\n\n2.

I'd be happy to help you with this question.\n\nStatement 1:\nSupport vector machines, like logistic regression models, give a probability distribution over the possible labels given an input example.\n\nThis statement is TRUE. Support vector machines (SVMs) and logistic regression models are both supervised learning algorithms that can be used for classification tasks. Both of these algorithms aim to find the decision boundary that separates the different classes in the input data. To do this, they assign a probability distribution over the possible labels given an input example.\n\nStatement 2:\nWe would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels.\n\nThis statement is FALSE.\n\nThe support vectors are the examples in the training data that lie closest to the decision boundary. The decision boundary is defined by the hyperplane that maximally separates the classes. In the case of linear kernels, the decision boundary is a linear hyperplane, and the support vectors are the examples that lie on this hyperplane.\n\nHowever, when we move to higher order polynomial kernels, the decision boundary becomes a more complex hyper surface. This means that the support vectors may change, as they are no longer confined to a linear hyperplane. In fact, the support vectors may not even lie on the decision boundary in the case of higher order polynomial kernels.\n\nSo, the support vectors may not remain the same as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) True, False.\n\nThe final answer is (C).",

Here's my step-by-step reasoning for each statement:\n\nStatement 1: The log-likelihood of the data will always increase through successive iterations of the expectation maximization algorithm.\n\nThis statement is False. While the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is designed to converge to the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters, there is no guarantee that the log-likelihood will always increase through successive iterations. In fact, it is possible for the log-likelihood to decrease or remain the same during certain iterations, especially when the starting values for the parameters are far from the true values.\n\nStatement 2: One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment.\n\nThis statement is True.

However, in general, we can make a few observations about how the model's variance changes as the number of training examples increases.\n\nFirst, as the number of training examples grows, the model will have more information to learn from, which can lead to a decrease in variance. This is because the model will have more data to fit the training examples to, which can help to reduce the spread of the model's predictions.\n\nHowever, it's not always the case that increasing the number of training examples will lead to a decrease in variance. In some cases, the model may overfit the training data, which means that it becomes too specialized to the training examples and has poor performance on new, unseen data. When this happens, the variance of the model may actually increase as the number of training examples grows.\n\nFinally, it's worth noting that the variance of a model is not a fixed property, but rather a function of the model and the data it is trained on.
