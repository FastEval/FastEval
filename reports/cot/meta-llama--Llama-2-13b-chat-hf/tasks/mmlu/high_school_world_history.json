By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Certainly! I'd be happy to help you answer this question.\n\nTo begin, let's break down the passage and identify the key points that relate to the argument. First, we know that in Western Europe during the 1200s-1400s, early cannons were useful in siege warfare, despite being heavy and slow to fire. This led governments to invest in their development and experimentation, ultimately resulting in more powerful and mobile gunpowder weapons.\n\nOn the other hand, China was primarily threatened by highly mobile steppe nomads, and early gunpowder weapons were of little utility against these foes. Instead, China focused on improving horse archer units to combat these nomads.\n\nNow, let's consider the large-scale questions about global history that the passage might relate to.\n\nOption A, \"How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other,\" does not fully align with the passage, as it does not explicitly discuss the sharing of technologies between societies.\n\nOption B, \"Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era,\" is partially relevant, as the passage mentions the development of gunpowder weapons in Western Europe, which could have contributed to military superiority. However, the passage does not explicitly discuss the modern era or the superiority of European states.\n\nOption C, \"Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.,\" is not relevant to the passage, as it does not mention Silk Road commerce or the 1500s.\n\nOption D, \"How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion,\" is also not relevant, as the passage does not discuss climate or cultural diffusion.\n\nNow, let's put the pieces together and consider the argument in the passage. The passage argues that the development of gunpowder weapons in Western Europe was influenced by the specific threats and circumstances of warfare in that region, while China focused on improving its horse archer units to combat nomadic threats. This suggests that the passage is arguing for a relationship between the unique historical context of a region and the development of military technology.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is... (B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.\n\nAnd, finally, the answer is... (B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.",

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

I'll be happy to help you with it.\n\nTo begin, let me just clarify that Ghanians is not a correct term to describe the people of the country mentioned in the passage. The correct term is \"Ghanaians.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the passage to find evidence of trade with Asia.\n\nFirstly, the passage mentions that the king of Ghana has interpreters, treasury officials, and ministers who are Muslims. This suggests that the country had established trade and cultural relations with Muslim nations in Asia, possibly through the Silk Road.\n\nSecondly, the king adorns himself with gold and jewels, which is likely to have come from India or other parts of Asia. This indicates that there was a significant amount of trade between Ghana and Asia, as gold and jewels were highly valued commodities in both regions.\n\nThirdly, the passage states that the people in the king's court wear silk robes. Silk was a highly prized textile in ancient Ghana, and it is likely that it was obtained through trade with Asian nations, such as China or India.\n\nBased on these details, it is evident that the people of Ghana were engaged in trade with Asia, directly or indirectly. The most likely answer is (C) The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is (C) The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.",

In fact, the passage states that the Russian troops were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there, and the nearest American troops were on Okinawa, 600 miles away.\n\nTherefore, option (B) \"The Americans established freedom for all Koreans\" is not a correct statement.\n\nHowever, option (D) \"Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel\" is a correct statement. The passage mentions that the 38th parallel was used as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender, which led to the division of Korea into two zones, with the Soviet Union controlling the north and the United States controlling the south. This division has had a lasting impact on the country and remains in place today.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.",

After World War I, Germany was forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed harsh penalties and reparations on the country.

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.
