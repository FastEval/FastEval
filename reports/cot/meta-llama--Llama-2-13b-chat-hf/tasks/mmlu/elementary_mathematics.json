            "model_answer": "Of course! I'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nTo start, let's take a look at the equation 24 = 2p. This equation is saying that 24 is equal to 2 times some value, which we'll call p.\n\nFirst, let's think about what we know about the number 24. It's a whole number, which means it's a positive integer. We also know that it's divisible by 2, because we can see that 2 goes into 24 exactly.\n\nNow, let's think about what we know about the letter p. It's a variable, which means it represents a value that can change. We know that p is a positive integer, because it's being multiplied by 2.\n\nWith these things in mind, let's try to solve for p. We can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, like this:\n\n24 = 2p\n\n\u00f7 2\n\n12 = p\n\nNow, we have a new equation that is a bit simpler. We can see that 12 is a positive integer, and it's what we get when we divide 24 by 2. So, we can say that:\n\np = 12\n\nTherefore, the value of p in the equation 24 = 2p is 12.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to help with?",

This means that she drove the same number of miles each day, so we can let x be the number of miles she drove each day.\n\nWe also know that she drove for 5 days, so we can multiply x by 5 to find the total number of miles she drove:\n\nx x 5 = 40\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n5x = 40\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\nx = 8\n\nSo, Ms. Perez drove 8 miles each day.\n\nThe answer is (C) 8.",
