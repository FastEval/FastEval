            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to isolate the variable p. We can start by simplifying the equation by multiplying both sides by 2 to get:\n\n2(24) = 2(2p)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n48 = 4p\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 4 to get:\n\np = 12\n\nSo, the value of p is 12.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) p = 12.",

            "model_answer": "Certainly! I'd be happy to help you with this question. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n1. Ms. Perez drove a total of 40 miles in 5 days.\n\nThis means that she drove a constant number of miles each day.\n\n2. She drove the same number of miles each day.\n\nSo, we can assume that she drove the same number of miles on each of the 5 days.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many miles Ms. Perez drove each day.\n\nSince she drove the same number of miles each day, we can set up an equation based on the total distance she drove:\n\n40 miles = x miles/day (where x is the number of miles she drove each day)\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 40:\n\nx miles/day = 40 miles / 40\n\nx miles/day = 1 mile/day\n\nSo, Ms. Perez drove 1 mile each day.\n\nAnd the answer is... (C) 8!\n\nMs. Perez drove 1 mile each day for 5 days, so the total distance she drove is 1 mile x 5 days = 5 miles. However, the answer options only list whole numbers, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 5 miles. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 8.",

I'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nFirst, let's start by looking at the dividend: \u221240.\n\nNext, let's look at the divisor: \u22128.\n\nNow, we need to find the quotient of \u221240 divided by \u22128. To do this, we need to invert the divisor (\u22128) to get the reciprocal.\n\nThe reciprocal of \u22128 is 8/\u22121 = 8.\n\nSo, we can write the division as \u221240 \u00f7 8 = \u221240 \u00f7 (8/\u22121) = \u221240 \u00f7 8.\n\nNow, we can compute the quotient by dividing \u221240 by 8:\n\n\u221240 \u00f7 8 = 5\n\nTherefore, the quotient of \u221240 \u00f7 (\u22128) is 5.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) \u22121 over 5.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know?",
