            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nGeneral relativity is a theory of gravitation and spacetime. It predicts that the curvature of spacetime is caused by the presence of matter and energy in the universe. This curvature of spacetime affects the motion of objects, including light. Therefore, general relativity predicts that light is affected by gravity in various ways.\r\n\r\n(A) Light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity: This is true because the Sun\u2019s gravitational field causes spacetime to be curved. As light travels through curved spacetime, it is slowed down. Therefore, light leaving the Sun is slowed down by the Sun\u2019s gravity.\r\n\r\n(B) Light passing the Sun is deflected: This is also true because the Sun\u2019s gravitational field causes spacetime to be curved. As light travels through curved spacetime, it is deflected. Therefore, light passing the Sun is deflected by the Sun\u2019s gravity.\r\n\r\n(C) A clock on the Sun\u2019s surface runs faster than on Earth: This is also true because the Sun\u2019s gravitational field causes spacetime to be curved. The curvature of spacetime causes time to run slower near massive objects, such as the Earth. Therefore, a clock on the Sun\u2019s surface runs faster than a clock on the Earth\u2019s surface.\r\n\r\n(D) All of these: All of the above statements are true because they are all predictions of general relativity. Therefore, the correct answer is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To calibrate a galvanometer, we need to know the relationship between the measured quantity and the deflection of the needle. This relationship is different for current and voltage.\n\nFor current, the deflection of the needle is directly proportional to the current flowing through the galvanometer. This means that if we increase the current, the needle will deflect more. If we decrease the current, the needle will deflect less.\n\nFor voltage, the deflection of the needle is proportional to the logarithm of the voltage. This means that if we increase the voltage, the needle will deflect more slowly than if we had increased the current. If we decrease the voltage, the needle will deflect less slowly than if we had decreased the current.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) voltage.",

The light that is being reflected is red in color, which is why we see the petals as red. \n\nGreen light is not being reflected by the red petals, so it is not present in the light that we see. \n\nWhite light contains all colors of the spectrum, including red, green, and yellow. When white light passes through a rose petal, some of the red and yellow light is reflected, but the green light is absorbed by the petal. Therefore, the light that we see when looking at the red petals of a rose is a mixture of red and yellow light, but not green light.",

When an aircraft is flying at supersonic speeds, the shock wave is produced as the aircraft passes through the air. \r\n\r\nOption (A) breaking the sound barrier is incorrect because the aircraft is already traveling faster than the speed of sound when it produces a sonic boom. \r\n\r\nOption (B) pulling out of a subsonic dive is incorrect because a sonic boom is not produced when an aircraft is pulling out of a dive. \r\n\r\nOption (D) Each of these produces a sonic boom is incorrect because only one of the options is correct. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) flying faster than sound.",

In a mercury barometer, the column of mercury expands and contracts with changes in pressure, allowing us to measure the height of the column. However, water does not expand or contract significantly with changes in pressure, making it unsuitable for use in a barometer. Therefore, a water barometer would be inoperable.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) gamma radiation. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nWhen a hydrogen isotope fuses with another hydrogen isotope, it releases a large amount of energy in the form of gamma radiation. This is because the fusion reaction involves the conversion of protons and neutrons into helium nuclei (alpha particles) and free neutrons. The energy released during this process is mainly in the form of gamma radiation, which is a type of high-energy electromagnetic radiation. \r\n\r\nThe kinetic energy of the alpha particle and the neutron is also released during the fusion reaction, but it is a much smaller amount of energy compared to the gamma radiation. This is because the alpha particle and the neutron have a much smaller mass compared to the gamma radiation, which has no mass. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the alpha particle and the neutron is not significant compared to the gamma radiation. \r\n\r\nIn summary, the majority of the energy released during a fusion reaction is in the form of gamma radiation, with a smaller amount of energy released as kinetic energy of the alpha particle and the neutron.",
