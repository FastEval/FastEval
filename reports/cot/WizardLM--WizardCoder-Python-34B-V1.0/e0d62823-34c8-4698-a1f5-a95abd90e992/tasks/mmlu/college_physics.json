We need to find the spring constant ($k$) to calculate the potential energy.\n\nThe spring constant can be found using Hooke's Law:\n\n$F = k x$\n\nwhere $F$ is the force exerted by the spring. In this case, the force is the weight of the mass ($F = m g$), and we can use the fact that the mass is at rest at its equilibrium position (where the spring force is zero) to find the spring constant:\n\n$0 = k x_e$\n\n$k = \\frac{m g}{x_e}$\n\nwhere $x_e$ is the equilibrium position. Since the mass is displaced from the equilibrium position by $0.030$ m, the equilibrium position is $0.030$ m in the negative direction. Therefore,\n\n$k = \\frac{0.30 \\times 9.81}{-0.030} = 3237.5$ N/m\n\nNow we can calculate the potential energy:\n\n$E_p = \\frac{1}{2} (3237.5)(0.030)^2 = 4.02 \\times 10^{-4}$ J\n\nNext, we can calculate the kinetic energy:\n\n$E_k = \\frac{1}{2} (0.30)(0.040)^2 = 0.0068$ J\n\nFinally, we add the potential and kinetic energies to get the total mechanical energy:\n\n$E = E_p + E_k = 4.02 \\times 10^{-4} + 0.0068 = 4.02 \\times 10^{-4} + 0.0068$ J\n\nTherefore, the total mechanical energy of the system is approximately 4.02 times 10 to the power of -4 joules plus 0.0068 joules, which is approximately 0.0068 joules.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) 0.38 mJ.",

The greater the difference in index of refraction, the greater the difference in the angle of incidence of the light rays on the interface between the two layers.

This means that certain wavelengths will be reflected more strongly by the oil layer than by the water layer.\n\nThe wavelength that is most strongly reflected by the oil layer is the wavelength that has the smallest difference in angle of incidence between the two layers.

When the pipe is open at both ends, all harmonics up to a certain limit will be produced. However, once the pipe is closed at one end, some of the harmonics may be attenuated or completely eliminated.\n\nTo determine which harmonics will survive once the pipe is closed at one end, we need to consider the physics of the pipe and the standing waves that form inside it. The length of the pipe determines the number of nodes inside the pipe, which in turn determines the harmonics that can be produced.\n\nIn this case, the first five harmonics are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. Assuming the length of the pipe is such that these harmonics can be produced, we can use the formula for the frequency of a standing wave in a pipe:\n\nf = (n * v) / (2 * L)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the standing wave, n is the number of nodes, v is the speed of sound in the pipe, and L is the length of the pipe.\n\nFor the first harmonic (50 Hz), we have:\n\nf1 = (1 * v) / (2 * L) = 50 Hz\n\nFor the second harmonic (100 Hz), we have:\n\nf2 = (2 * v) / (2 * L) = 100 Hz\n\nFor the third harmonic (150 Hz), we have:\n\nf3 = (3 * v) / (2 * L) = 150 Hz\n\nFor the fourth harmonic (200 Hz), we have:\n\nf4 = (4 * v) / (2 * L) = 200 Hz\n\nFor the fifth harmonic (250 Hz), we have:\n\nf5 = (5 * v) / (2 * L) = 250 Hz\n\nNow, let's assume that the pipe is closed at one end. This will affect the number of nodes inside the pipe, which in turn will affect the harmonics that can be produced. Specifically, the nodes will be shifted towards the open end of the pipe, and some of the harmonics may be attenuated or eliminated altogether.\n\nTo determine which harmonics will be affected, we can compare the frequencies of the harmonics before and after the pipe is closed. Specifically, we can calculate the new frequencies of the harmonics using the formula for the frequency of a standing wave in a pipe with one end closed:\n\nf = (n * v) / L\n\nwhere n is the number of half-length nodes inside the pipe, and L is the length of the pipe.\n\nFor the first harmonic (50 Hz), we have:\n\nf1 = (1/2 * v) / L\n\nFor the second harmonic (100 Hz), we have:\n\nf2 = (1 * v) / L\n\nFor the third harmonic (150 Hz), we have:\n\nf3 = (3/2 * v) / L\n\nFor the fourth harmonic (200 Hz), we have:\n\nf4 = (2 * v) / L\n\nFor the fifth harmonic (250 Hz), we have:\n\nf5 = (5/2 * v) / L\n\nNow, we can compare the frequencies of the harmonics before and after the pipe is closed. Specifically, we can see which harmonics are still present and which have been attenuated or eliminated altogether.\n\nFor the first harmonic (50 Hz), the frequency before closing the pipe (f1 = 50 Hz) is the same as the frequency after closing the pipe (f1 = 25 Hz). Therefore, this harmonic will still be present after the pipe is closed.\n\nFor the second harmonic (100 Hz), the frequency before closing the pipe (f2 = 100 Hz) is twice the frequency after closing the pipe (f2 = 50 Hz). Therefore, this harmonic will be attenuated by a factor of 2 after the pipe is closed.\n\nFor the third harmonic (150 Hz), the frequency before closing the pipe (f3 = 150 Hz) is three times the frequency after closing the pipe (f3 = 50 Hz). Therefore, this harmonic will be attenuated by a factor of 3 after the pipe is closed.\n\nFor the fourth harmonic (200 Hz), the frequency before closing the pipe (f4 = 200 Hz) is twice the frequency after closing the pipe (f4 = 100 Hz). Therefore, this harmonic will be attenuated by a factor of 2 after the pipe is closed.\n\nFor the fifth harmonic (250 Hz), the frequency before closing the pipe (f5 = 250 Hz) is five times the frequency after closing the pipe (f5 = 50 Hz). Therefore, this harmonic will be attenuated by a factor of 5 after the pipe is closed.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the harmonics that will survive once the pipe is closed at one end are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, and 200 Hz. The harmonics 150 Hz and 250 Hz will be attenuated by factors of 3 and 5, respectively, and may no longer be audible. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only",
