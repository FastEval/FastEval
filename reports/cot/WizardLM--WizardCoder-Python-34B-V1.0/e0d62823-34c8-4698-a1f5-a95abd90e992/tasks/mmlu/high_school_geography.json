            "question": "Which of the following is LEAST self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry?\n\n(A) United States\n(B) Japan\n(C) France\n(D) United Kingdom",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the four countries is the least self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. Access to raw materials: Countries that have easy access to raw materials, such as oil, coal, and minerals, are more self-sufficient than those that do not.\n\n2. Industrialization level: Countries that have been industrialized for a longer period of time are more self-sufficient in natural resources, as they have developed more efficient methods of extracting and processing raw materials.\n\n3. Environmental policies: Countries that have stricter environmental policies and regulations are more self-sufficient in natural resources, as they are more careful about the use and conservation of natural resources.\n\nBased on these factors, we can make the following assessment:\n\nUnited States: The United States has easy access to a wide variety of raw materials, including oil, coal, and minerals. It is also one of the most industrialized countries in the world, with advanced methods of extracting and processing raw materials. However, the United States has not been as strict with environmental policies and regulations, which could make it less self-sufficient in natural resources.\n\nJapan: Japan has easy access to a wide variety of raw materials, including oil, coal, and minerals. It is also one of the most industrialized countries in the world, with advanced methods of extracting and processing raw materials. However, Japan has not been as strict with environmental policies and regulations, which could make it less self-sufficient in natural resources.\n\nFrance: France has easy access to a wide variety of raw materials, including oil, coal, and minerals. It is also one of the most industrialized countries in the world, with advanced methods of extracting and processing raw materials. However, France has strict environmental policies and regulations, which could make it less self-sufficient in natural resources.\n\nUnited Kingdom: The United Kingdom has easy access to a wide variety of raw materials, including oil, coal, and minerals. It is also one of the most industrialized countries in the world, with advanced methods of extracting and processing raw materials. However, the United Kingdom has not been as strict with environmental policies and regulations, which could make it less self-sufficient in natural resources.\n\nBased on these assessments, we can conclude that France is the least self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry, as it has strict environmental policies and regulations that could make it more difficult to access and use natural resources efficiently.",

            "question": "When a new fashion design is introduced globally, the information initially travels through a process known as\n\n(A) contagious diffusion\n(B) relocation diffusion\n(C) innovative diffusion\n(D) hierarchical diffusion",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) innovative diffusion. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nWhen a new fashion design is introduced globally, it travels through a process known as innovative diffusion. This is because innovative diffusion refers to the process in which new ideas, products, or behaviors spread from one person or group to another through imitation, influence, or contact. In this case, the new fashion design spreads from one person or group to another through imitation, influence, or contact, making it an innovative diffusion process. \r\n\r\nContagious diffusion refers to the spread of an idea, product, or behavior through social contact and personal influence. However, in this case, the new fashion design is not spreading through social contact and personal influence, but rather through imitation or influence. \r\n\r\nRelocation diffusion refers to the process in which a new idea, product, or behavior spreads from one region or group to another. However, in this case, the new fashion design is not spreading from one region or group to another, but rather from one person or group to another. \r\n\r\nHierarchical diffusion refers to the process in which a new idea, product, or behavior spreads from higher-status groups to lower-status groups. However, in this case, the new fashion design is not spreading from higher-status groups to lower-status groups, but rather from one person or group to another.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation?\n\n(A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.\n(B) The core will always dominate the periphery.\n(C) Growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery.\n(D) Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nGunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation is based on the idea that economic development occurs through a process of cumulative causation. This means that economic development is a process where the initial conditions of a region determine its future development, and this development in turn affects future development. In other words, the development of a region is influenced by its past development and the development of other regions.\r\n\r\nThe theory of cumulative causation has four main components:\r\n\r\n1. The core-periphery relationship: The core-periphery relationship refers to the idea that there are regions that are more developed than others, and these regions tend to attract labor, capital, and trade from less developed regions. This leads to the accumulation of wealth in the core regions at the expense of the periphery regions.\r\n\r\n2. The law of diminishing marginal returns: This law states that the returns from investing in a particular resource or activity decline as the resource or activity becomes more abundant. In other words, the returns from investing in a particular resource or activity are proportional to the scarcity of that resource or activity.\r\n\r\n3. The law of increasing returns: This law states that the returns from investing in a particular resource or activity increase as the level of that resource or activity increases. In other words, the returns from investing in a particular resource or activity are proportional to the level of that resource or activity.\r\n\r\n4. The law of relative depreciation: This law states that the value of a resource or activity decreases as the level of that resource or activity increases. In other words, the value of a resource or activity is inversely proportional to the level of that resource or activity.\r\n\r\nNow, let's look at the four statements given in the question:\r\n\r\n(A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.\r\n\r\nThis statement is part of the theory of cumulative causation, as it refers to the core-periphery relationship and the law of increasing returns. It states that regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade, which leads to the accumulation of wealth in the core regions at the expense of the periphery regions.\r\n\r\n(B) The core will always dominate the periphery.\r\n\r\nThis statement is also part of the theory of cumulative causation, as it refers to the core-periphery relationship. It states that the core will always dominate the periphery, meaning that the more developed regions will always attract labor, capital, and trade from less developed regions.\r\n\r\n(C) Growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery.\r\n\r\nThis statement is also part of the theory of cumulative causation, as it refers to the core-periphery relationship and the law of diminishing marginal returns. It states that the development of the core exists at the expense of the periphery, meaning that the more developed regions will attract labor, capital, and trade from less developed regions, leading to the accumulation of wealth in the core regions at the expense of the periphery regions.\r\n\r\n(D) Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade.\r\n\r\nThis statement is also part of the theory of cumulative causation, as it refers to the core-periphery relationship and the law of increasing returns. It states that regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade, which leads to the accumulation of wealth in the core regions at the expense of the periphery regions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, all four statements are part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation. The answer is:\r\n\r\n(A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) agglomeration. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nAgglomeration is the process of clustering or grouping of production activities and people in a particular area to benefit everyone. It is a strategy that concentrates economic activities in certain areas to create a more efficient and productive economy. Agglomeration can lead to economic growth, job creation, and increased productivity. \r\n\r\nDeglomeration, on the other hand, is the opposite of agglomeration. It refers to the dispersal of economic activities and people to less concentrated areas. \r\n\r\nSubstitution principle and infrastructure are not related to the concentration of production activities and people spatially to benefit everyone.",

These activities typically involve higher education and require specialized skills. Examples of tertiary activities include research, development, and management. \r\n\r\nIn developing countries, the majority of workers are likely to be employed in tertiary activities, as these activities require specialized skills and education that are not commonly available in these countries.
