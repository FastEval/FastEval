            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The writer most associated with bureaucratic structures is (B) Max Weber. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nBureaucracy refers to the system of government through a hierarchy of officials. It is a system of organized and centralized government that is characterized by a large, permanent, and professionalized bureaucracy. \r\n\r\nMax Weber was a German sociologist who is known for his work on bureaucracy. He is considered the father of bureaucratic theory and is known for his work on the \"iron cage\" theory. \r\n\r\nWeber believed that bureaucracy is a necessary and desirable institution, but it can also be harmful if it is not properly managed. He argued that bureaucracy is a rational and efficient way to manage complex organizations, but it can become bureaucratic if it is not properly managed. \r\n\r\nWeber also believed that bureaucracy is a product of modern society and is not inherent to all societies. He argued that bureaucracy is a recent development in history and is not a natural state of human society. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Max Weber is the most associated writer with bureaucratic structures because of his work on bureaucracy and his contributions to the field of sociology.",
