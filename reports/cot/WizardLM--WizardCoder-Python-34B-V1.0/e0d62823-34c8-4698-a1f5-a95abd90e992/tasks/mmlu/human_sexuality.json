            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The onset of labor is first triggered by hormones secreted by the Mother's ovaries. \r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nHormones are chemical signals that are released by cells in the body to communicate with other cells. Hormones play a vital role in the regulation of many bodily functions, including reproduction. During pregnancy, the ovaries of the mother secrete hormones that stimulate the growth and development of the fetus. These hormones also prepare the uterus for childbirth by thickening and stretching the uterine muscles. As the pregnancy progresses, the uterus produces more and more prostaglandins, which are chemicals that help to soften and dilate the cervix, making childbirth easier. However, prostaglandins do not trigger the onset of labor directly. Instead, they help to prepare the cervix for labor by softening and thinning it. Once the cervix is sufficiently softened, the mother's body senses that childbirth is imminent and triggers the release of oxytocin, a hormone that stimulates the uterus to contract and push the baby out. This contraction is the first stage of labor, and it is triggered by the release of oxytocin, which is secreted by the mother's ovaries.",

            "model_answer": "The correct theory that uses terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour is:\n\n(D) social learning theory\n\nExplanation:\n\nSociobiology is a theory that explains behaviour in terms of genetic factors and social interactions. It does not specifically address the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour.\n\nPsychoanalytic theory is a theory that explains behaviour in terms of unconscious drives and conflicts. It does not specifically address the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour.\n\nScript theory is a theory that explains behaviour in terms of social scripts and social norms. It does not specifically address the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour.\n\nSocial learning theory, on the other hand, explains behaviour in terms of the interaction between the individual and the environment. It specifically addresses the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour by positing that individuals can be influenced by their environment and can learn from others. This theory uses terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain how individuals can be influenced by their environment and learn from others.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) The luteal phase. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nThe luteal phase is a period of about 14 days after ovulation, during which the follicle that contains the egg undergoes a series of changes that prepare it for implantation. During this phase, the corpus luteum is formed, which produces progesterone and estrogen. The corpus luteum also secretes a substance called chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which stimulates the growth of the placenta and the development of the fetus. The shedding of the inner lining of the uterus, known as menstruation, occurs during the luteal phase, when the corpus luteum produces too much progesterone and estrogen, causing the uterus to contract and shed its lining. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) The luteal phase.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The most hospitable environment for sperm passage is at the time of ovulation. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nSperm passage occurs during the time of ovulation, which is the release of an egg from the ovary. This is the most optimal time for sperm to meet the egg and fertilization to occur. \r\n\r\nPreovulation is the time before ovulation, when the ovaries are producing eggs but they have not yet been released. Proliferation is the process of cell division and growth, which occurs throughout the menstrual cycle. Menstruation is the shedding of the uterine lining at the end of the menstrual cycle. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) ovulation.",

Gonorrhea and chlamydia can infect any part of the male reproductive system, but they are most commonly found in the urethra.\n4. The urethra is a tube that connects the bladder to the outside of the body. It is the passageway through which urine leaves the body.\n5. When a man has sex, the urethra is the first part of the male reproductive system to come into contact with a female's reproductive tract.\n6. Because the urethra is the first part of the male reproductive system to come into contact with a female's reproductive tract, it is the most likely place for gonorrhea and chlamydia to infect a man.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) urethra.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To find the length of the embryo at 28 days after conception, we need to consider the developmental stages of the embryo. At this stage, the embryo has gone through the following stages:\r\n\r\n1. Implantation: The fertilized egg cell attaches to the wall of the uterus.\r\n2. Blastocyst formation: The embryo undergoes cleavage and the blastocyst forms.\r\n3. Morula formation: The blastocyst undergoes mitosis and forms the morula.\r\n4. Gastrulation: The morula undergoes cell division and forms the blastula.\r\n5. Embryo formation: The blastula undergoes further cell division and forms the embryo.\r\n\r\nAt 28 days after conception, the embryo is about 1 centimeter long. This is because the embryo has just started to form the primitive streak, which is the first visible structure in the embryo. The primitive streak is a group of cells that will eventually form the neural tube, which will eventually become the brain and spinal cord. The primitive streak is visible as a faint line in the middle of the blastocyst. At this stage, the embryo is about 0.5 mm long, but it is difficult to see with the naked eye. Therefore, we round up to 1 cm.",

It is possible that Timmy will grow up to be gay, but it is also possible that he will not.\n\n(B) He will not be popular with his peers.\nThis option suggests that Timmy will not be popular with his peers. While this may be true for some children, it is not necessarily true for all children. Some children are not popular with their peers regardless of their family structure.\n\n(C) As long as Timmy has at least one supportive and accepting caregiver he will have a healthy development.\nThis option suggests that Timmy will have a healthy development as long as he has at least one supportive and accepting caregiver. This is a reasonable assumption, as children who have supportive and accepting caregivers tend to develop better than those who do not.\n\n(D) His social skills will lag behind his peers who are raised in heterosexual families.\nThis option suggests that Timmy's social skills will lag behind those of his peers who are raised in heterosexual families.
