            "question": "Compared to DNA viral replication, RNA viral replication is more susceptible to mutation because\n\n(A) RNA replication takes place in the cytoplasm, whereas DNA replication takes place in the nucleus.\n(B) RNA viruses replicate much faster than DNA viruses.\n(C) RNA viruses use uracil instead of thymine.\n(D) RNA replication lacks the proofreading functions characteristic of DNA replication.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D).\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nRNA viral replication is more susceptible to mutation because it lacks the proofreading functions characteristic of DNA replication.\r\n\r\nDNA replication is a highly accurate process that involves multiple checks and balances to ensure that only the correct nucleotides are copied into the new strand of DNA. These checks include proofreading by enzymes that can recognize and fix errors, as well as the use of DNA polymerase that can copy only the correct sequence of nucleotides. In contrast, RNA replication lacks these proofreading functions and can lead to the incorporation of incorrect nucleotides into the RNA strand, leading to mutations in the viral genome.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the statement \"RNA viral replication is more susceptible to mutation\" is true because RNA replication lacks the proofreading functions that DNA replication has, making it more prone to errors and mutations.",

In other words, the trait is not selected for because it does not provide any benefit to the organism, but it becomes more common in the population due to genetic drift. \r\n\r\nIn the case of horses, genetic drift has led to an increase in their size over time, but this increase in size does not provide any adaptive advantage.

Hemoglobin's affinity for O2 is affected by the pH of the blood, the concentration of H+ ions, and the concentration of CO2. \r\n\r\n(A) is incorrect because as the blood pH decreases, the affinity of hemoglobin for O2 increases, not decreases. \r\n\r\n(B) is incorrect because an increase in H+ concentration would increase the affinity of hemoglobin for O2, not decrease it. \r\n\r\n(C) is incorrect because exercising muscle tissue increases the demand for O2, not the affinity of hemoglobin for O2. \r\n\r\n(D) is correct because as CO2 concentration decreases, the affinity of hemoglobin for O2 increases.

A repressor is a protein that binds to the promoter region of a gene and prevents the RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter, thereby reducing the rate of transcription. This is in contrast to an enhancer, which binds to the promoter region of a gene and increases the rate of transcription by increasing the affinity of RNA polymerase for the promoter.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A). \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nInterspecific breeding is the mating between two different species of organisms. It is a key process in evolution, as it allows for the exchange of genetic material between species, which can lead to the evolution of new traits and adaptations. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are several factors that can prevent interspecific breeding from occurring. These include genetic incompatibility, physical incompatibility, behavioral differences, and reproductive isolation. \r\n\r\nGeographic isolation occurs when two species occupy different geographic regions and do not overlap. This can prevent interspecific breeding by preventing the exchange of genetic material between the two species. \r\n\r\nBehavioral isolation occurs when two species have different behavioral traits that prevent them from interacting with each other. This can prevent interspecific breeding by preventing the potential mates from recognizing each other or interacting in a way that allows for mating. \r\n\r\nCourtship rituals are behavioral displays that individuals of the same species perform to attract potential mates. If two species have different courtship rituals, they may not recognize each other's displays and may not be able to mate. \r\n\r\nBreeding seasons are the times of year when individuals of a species are most receptive to mating. If two species have similar breeding seasons, they may overlap and be able to mate. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer is (A) because geographic isolation is the only factor that prevents interspecific breeding by physically preventing the exchange of genetic material between the two species.",

This results in the formation of new combinations of genes, which can lead to variation in the offspring. Therefore, crossing-over during meiosis permits scientists to determine the chance for variation in zygotes.
