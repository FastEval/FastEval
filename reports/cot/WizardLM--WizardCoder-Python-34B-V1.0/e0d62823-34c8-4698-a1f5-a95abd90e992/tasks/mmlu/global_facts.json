            "model_answer": "To find the percentage of Americans living in urban areas, we need to compare the number of people living in urban areas to the total number of people in the United States. We can get this information from the U.S. Census Bureau's most recent data on population and housing.\n\nAccording to the 2017 American Community Survey (ACS), there were approximately 328.2 million people living in the United States. Of these, 222.9 million (67.9%) lived in urban areas, while 105.3 million (32.1%) lived in rural areas.\n\nTo find the percentage of Americans living in urban areas, we need to divide the number of people living in urban areas by the total number of people in the United States and multiply by 100.\n\n222.9 million / 328.2 million * 100 = 67.9%\n\nTherefore, as of 2017, 67.9% of Americans live in urban areas.",

            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nThe global fertility rate refers to the average number of children that a woman would bear during her lifetime. It is calculated by dividing the total number of births in a year by the total number of women of childbearing age in the same year. The United Nations Population Division defines childbearing age as the period between 15 and 49 years of age.\r\n\r\nAccording to the United Nations, the global fertility rate in 2015 was 2.1 children per woman. This means that, on average, each woman in the world would bear 2.1 children during her lifetime. However, the actual number of children that a woman would bear depends on various factors such as her age, education, economic status, and access to contraception. Therefore, it is important to consider the context and the specific country or region when discussing the global fertility rate.\r\n\r\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is (B) 2.5 children per woman.",

Let's assume that 70% of the population uses the internet regularly, and that 80% of those who use the internet regularly use it in the past three months. Therefore, the number of people who used the internet in the past three months is approximately 200 million x 0.7 x 0.8 = 112 million.\n\nNow, we can calculate the fraction of the population in Brazil who used the internet in the past three months:\n\nFraction = Number of people who used the internet in the past three months / Total population\n       = 112 million / 200 million\n       = 0.56\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(C) 58%",

Based on this definition, we can assume that the survey respondents who reported having paid a bribe in the last year are those who paid a bribe to access public services.\n\nNext, we need to understand what percentage of survey respondents from Mexico reported having paid a bribe in the last year. This information is not provided in the question, so we cannot calculate the percentage directly. However, we can make some assumptions based on the available information.\n\nAssuming that the survey was conducted in 2017, we can assume that the survey respondents are those who accessed public services in Mexico during the year 2016. Based on this assumption, we can estimate that the percentage of survey respondents from Mexico who reported having paid a bribe in the last year is around 10-15%.

The Iran Contra scandal was a political scandal that involved the illegal sale of weapons to Iran and the use of the proceeds to fund the Nicaraguan Contras, a group of anti-communist rebels fighting against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The scandal was uncovered in 1986 and led to the resignation of National Security Advisor Oliver North and the indictment of several high-ranking Reagan administration officials.\n\nDuring the scandal, Reagan was accused of withholding information from Congress about the sale of weapons to Iran. This accusation led to a public backlash against Reagan and his administration. According to a Gallup poll taken in October 1986, 52% of Americans believed Reagan was withholding information about the Iran-Contra affair.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) 50%",
