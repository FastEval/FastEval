The shell model is a model used to describe the arrangement of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. It is based on the idea that protons and neutrons are organized in shells, where each shell can hold a fixed number of particles. The number of protons in the nucleus determines the number of shells, and the number of particles in each shell determines the energy level of that shell.\n\nThe 55Mn nucleus has 27 protons and 28 neutrons. The first shell can hold a maximum of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, the second shell can hold a maximum of 8 protons and 8 neutrons, the third shell can hold a maximum of 18 protons and 18 neutrons, and the fourth shell can hold a maximum of 27 protons and 28 neutrons.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to use the fact that the relative intensities of the two peaks in the 1H spectrum are \u03b1 and 3\u03b1. This means that the area of the peak corresponding to DMSO is \u03b1 times the area of the peak corresponding to AN. We can use this information to calculate the ratio of the two concentrations.\n\nLet's call the concentration of DMSO [DMSO] and the concentration of AN [AN]. Then, we have:\n\nArea of DMSO peak = \u03b1 * Area of AN peak\n\nIf we divide both sides by the area of the AN peak, we get:\n\n[DMSO] / [AN] = \u03b1\n\nNow, we know that the relative intensity of the DMSO peak is \u03b1, which means that \u03b1 is the ratio of the heights of the two peaks. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\u03b1 = Height of DMSO peak / Height of AN peak\n\nIf we substitute this expression for \u03b1 in the previous equation, we get:\n\n[DMSO] / [AN] = Height of DMSO peak / Height of AN peak\n\nMultiplying both sides by [AN] * Height of AN peak, we get:\n\n[DMSO] * Height of AN peak = Height of DMSO peak * [AN] * Height of AN peak\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n[DMSO] = Height of DMSO peak / Height of AN peak * [AN]\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the concentrations [DMSO]:[AN]. To do this, we need to express [DMSO] and [AN] in terms of their respective peak areas. Let's call the area of the DMSO peak A and the area of the AN peak B. Then, we have:\n\n[DMSO] = A / (\u03b1 * B)\n[AN] = B / \u03b1\n\nSubstituting these expressions for [DMSO] and [AN] in the equation we derived earlier, we get:\n\nA / (\u03b1 * B) = Height of DMSO peak / Height of AN peak * B / \u03b1\n\nMultiplying both sides by \u03b1 * B, we get:\n\nA = Height of DMSO peak * B / (\u03b1 * Height of AN peak)\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio [DMSO]:[AN] as:\n\n[DMSO]:[AN] = A / B\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 1:6.",

The ions are formed when the sample is subjected to a high-energy source, such as an electron gun or a plasma source. The ions are then accelerated in a vacuum chamber and deflected by a magnetic field. The deflection is proportional to the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions, which allows for the separation of different species. \r\n\r\nCharacteristic I: Analyte molecules are converted to gaseous ions.\r\nThis is correct.
