            "model_answer": "NGS is most often used to:\r\n\r\n(A) identify a newly discovered virus\r\n(B) search for drug resistant mutants\r\n(C) identify quasi species viruses\r\n(D) Cannot be used\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nNGS is a technique used to sequence DNA or RNA from a sample. It is commonly used in various fields such as biology, medicine, and forensics. In the field of biology, NGS is used to study the genetic makeup of organisms, including viruses, bacteria, and other microorganisms. It is also used to study the genetic diversity of species and to identify genetic variations that may lead to disease or drug resistance. In the field of medicine, NGS is used to detect mutations in genes that cause disease or drug resistance. It is also used to study the genetic makeup of cancer cells to identify mutations that may lead to cancer development or progression. In forensics, NGS is used to identify and analyze DNA evidence from crime scenes, including rape and murder cases.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling the following:\r\n\r\n(A) Placebo effect\r\n\r\nExplanation: Randomization is used to ensure that the placebo group and the treatment group are comparable in terms of baseline characteristics. This helps to reduce the placebo effect, which occurs when patients receiving a placebo believe that they are receiving an active treatment and experience positive outcomes as a result. Randomization helps to ensure that any observed positive outcomes are due to the treatment and not the placebo effect.\r\n\r\n(B) Recall bias\r\n\r\nExplanation: Recall bias occurs when patients with a positive outcome have a better memory of the treatment than patients with a negative outcome. Randomization helps to ensure that both groups of patients are equally likely to experience the treatment and recall it accurately, reducing the potential for recall bias.\r\n\r\n(C) Non-compliance\r\n\r\nExplanation: Randomization helps to ensure that both groups of patients receive the treatment and are equally likely to comply with the treatment regimen. This reduces the potential for non-compliance, which can lead to inaccurate results.\r\n\r\n(D) Effect modification (interaction)\r\n\r\nExplanation: Randomization helps to control for the potential for effect modification, which occurs when the treatment has a different effect on different subgroups of patients. Randomization helps to ensure that the treatment and control groups are comparable in terms of baseline characteristics, reducing the potential for effect modification.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Longitudinal. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nA clinical trial is a type of study design that involves testing a new medical treatment on a group of people to determine its effectiveness and safety. It involves two phases: the first phase is the treatment phase, where the participants are randomly assigned to receive either the new treatment or a placebo (a dummy treatment that appears to be the new treatment but is in fact inactive). The second phase is the follow-up phase, where the participants are observed over time on a standard set of measures to ascertain the potential effects of the treatment. \r\n\r\nA double-blind study is a type of clinical trial in which neither the participants nor the researchers know which participants have received the new treatment and which have received the placebo. This is done to minimize bias and ensure that the results are not influenced by the expectations of the participants or researchers. \r\n\r\nA prospective cohort study is a type of study design that involves following a group of people over time to observe their health status and outcomes. In this type of study, the participants are selected before the study begins, and their health status is measured at regular intervals over time. \r\n\r\nA longitudinal study is a type of study design that involves following a group of people over time on a standard set of measures to ascertain the potential effects of an environmental toxin. In this type of study, the participants are not treated or given any intervention, but their health status is measured at regular intervals over time. This type of study is useful for understanding the long-term effects of an environmental toxin on health, as opposed to a clinical trial or prospective cohort study, which focus on short-term effects.",

These oncogenic proteins are responsible for transforming normal cells into cancer cells. The viral genome is integrated into the cellular DNA, which allows the viral genes to be expressed continuously, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer formation. The viral genome also contains sequences that can activate cellular oncogenes, which further enhances the cancer-causing potential of the papilloma viruses. Therefore, the answer is (A).",

It involves the production of antibodies and the creation of memory cells that can recognize and destroy invading pathogens. The ability to distinguish self and non-self is a crucial feature of adaptive immunity because it allows the body to distinguish between its own cells and tissues and those of invading pathogens. This is essential for the development of specific immune responses that can target and destroy pathogens without harming the body's own tissues.

However, vaccines do not prevent all diseases and some vaccines may cause side effects. \r\n\r\nAntivirals can be used to treat viral infections, but they cannot prevent the disease from occurring in the first place. \r\n\r\nHygiene, on the other hand, is a practice that helps prevent the spread of disease by reducing the number of pathogens that can be transmitted from one person to another.

In this case, the association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer is confounded by the association between smoking and lung cancer. This means that the association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer is not due to the effect of alcohol consumption alone, but rather due to the shared effect of alcohol consumption and smoking on lung cancer. \r\n\r\nTo correct for this confounding, the researchers would need to adjust their analysis to account for the effect of smoking on lung cancer. This could be done by including smoking status as a covariate in the statistical model, or by conducting separate analyses for smokers and non-smokers.",
