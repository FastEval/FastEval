One of the key elements of this is the adoption of a professional skepticism of management, which means that the auditor should be cautious and critical in their evaluation of the entity's internal controls and financial statements. This is because the auditor's role is to provide an independent and objective assessment of the entity's financial statements, and this can only be achieved if the auditor maintains a healthy degree of skepticism towards management's assertions and explanations. Therefore, the adoption of a professional skepticism of management is an essential element of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the auditing practice.",

Therefore, the total cash in the safe is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cash in the checkbook. The checkbook balance on December 31 was $10000, but it also included a check for $1000 that was returned by the bank and stamped \"NSF\".

            "model_answer": "Strom's basis in Ace is $26,000. Here's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Strom contributed land with an adjusted basis of $16,000 and a fair market value of $50,000.\n2. The land was subject to a $24,000 mortgage, which was assumed by Ace.\n3. No other liabilities existed at the time of the contribution.\n4. Strom acquired a 25% interest in Ace Partnership, which means that Strom's total interest in Ace is 25% of the total interest of all partners.\n5. To calculate Strom's basis in Ace, we need to determine the total basis of Ace. The total basis of Ace is the sum of the basis of each partner's interest in the partnership.\n6. Since Strom contributed land with an adjusted basis of $16,000 and a fair market value of $50,000, we can assume that the total basis of the land is $16,000.\n7. The total basis of Ace is the total basis of the land plus any liabilities that the partnership assumed. In this case, the only liability is the $24,000 mortgage, which was assumed by Ace. Therefore, the total basis of Ace is $16,000 + $24,000 = $40,000.\n8. Since Strom acquired a 25% interest in Ace Partnership, Strom's interest in Ace is 25% of the total interest of all partners. Therefore, Strom's basis in Ace is 25% of the total basis of Ace.\n9. 25% of $40,000 is $10,000.\n10. However, since Strom contributed land with a fair market value of $50,000, we need to adjust Strom's basis in Ace to reflect the increase in value. To do this, we need to add the difference between the adjusted basis of the contributed land and its fair market value to Strom's basis in Ace.\n11. The difference between the adjusted basis of the contributed land and its fair market value is $50,000 - $16,000 = $34,000.\n12. Therefore, Strom's basis in Ace is $10,000 + $34,000 = $44,000.\n13. However, since Strom's interest in Ace is 25% of the total interest of all partners, Strom's basis in Ace is 25% of the total basis of Ace.\n14. 25% of $44,000 is $11,000.\n15. Therefore, Strom's basis in Ace is $11,000.",

This means that the holder has the right to vote on matters such as the election of directors, approval of mergers and acquisitions, and other important corporate decisions. The holder's vote is counted the same as the votes of common stockholders, and the holder's vote is generally required for significant corporate actions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a holder of cumulative preferred stock is not always entitled to conversion of the preferred stock into common stock. This right is typically only granted to holders of the preferred stock if the corporation is in financial distress or is undergoing a restructuring. In such cases, the corporation may offer to convert some or all of the preferred stock into common stock in order to raise capital or improve the corporation's financial position.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a holder of cumulative preferred stock is not always entitled to dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid. Dividend carryovers occur when a corporation does not pay dividends in one year but chooses to carry over the unpaid dividends to the next year. In such cases, the cumulative preferred stockholders are not entitled to receive the carryover dividends until they are actually paid to common stockholders.\r\n\r\nFinally, a holder of cumulative preferred stock is not always entitled to guaranteed dividends. Guaranteed dividends are dividends that are paid regardless of the corporation's financial performance or ability to pay dividends. In practice, guaranteed dividends are rare, and they are typically only granted to holders of preferred stock in exchange for giving up some of their voting rights or other preferences.",
