            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases. \n\nExplanation: \n\nWhen a company buys an original Matisse painting to hang in its board room, it is increasing its investment in immovable property (I). This means that the company is investing its resources in a tangible asset that will provide a return in the future. Increasing I will lead to an increase in GDP (Gross Domestic Product) because it indicates that the economy is growing and producing more goods and services. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nIf the government collects more money in net taxes than it spends, it means that it is collecting more taxes than it is spending. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as a booming economy that generates more tax revenue, or a decrease in spending due to austerity measures. \r\n\r\nIn any case, the difference between the amount of taxes collected and the amount of spending is a positive number. This means that the government has a surplus of money, which it can use to invest in infrastructure, increase social spending, or pay down debt. \r\n\r\nThis surplus is known as a budget surplus. A budget surplus is the opposite of a budget deficit, which occurs when the government spends more than it collects in taxes. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) a budget surplus.",

            "model_answer": "The best example of a negative supply shock to the economy would be:\r\n\r\n(A) a decrease in government spending.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nA negative supply shock occurs when there is a sudden reduction in the supply of goods and services in the economy. This can have a negative impact on economic growth and the overall health of the economy. \r\n\r\nWhen government spending decreases, it means that the government is reducing its expenditure on public goods and services. This can lead to a reduction in the supply of goods and services in the economy, which in turn can lead to a negative supply shock. \r\n\r\nFor example, if the government reduces its spending on infrastructure projects, it can lead to a reduction in the supply of goods and services such as roads, bridges, and other infrastructure. This can have a negative impact on economic growth and the overall health of the economy.\r\n\r\n(B) a decrease in the real interest rate.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nA negative supply shock occurs when there is a sudden reduction in the supply of goods and services in the economy. This can have a negative impact on economic growth and the overall health of the economy. \r\n\r\nWhen the real interest rate decreases, it means that the cost of borrowing money has decreased. This can lead to a reduction in the supply of goods and services in the economy, which in turn can lead to a negative supply shock. \r\n\r\nFor example, if the central bank lowers the interest rate, it can lead to a reduction in the cost of borrowing money, which can lead to a reduction in the supply of goods and services. This can have a negative impact on economic growth and the overall health of the economy.\r\n\r\n(C) an increase in the money supply.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nA negative supply shock occurs when there is a sudden reduction in the supply of goods and services in the economy. This can have a negative impact on economic growth and the overall health of the economy. \r\n\r\nAn increase in the money supply can lead to a reduction in the supply of goods and services in the economy, which in turn can lead to a negative supply shock. \r\n\r\nFor example, if the central bank increases the money supply by printing more money, it can lead to an increase in the amount of money in the economy, which can lead to a reduction in the supply of goods and services. This can have a negative impact on economic growth and the overall health of the economy.\r\n\r\n(D) unexpectedly higher resource prices.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nA negative supply shock occurs when there is a sudden reduction in the supply of goods and services in the economy. This can have a negative impact on economic growth and the overall health of the economy. \r\n\r\nAn unexpected increase in resource prices can lead to a reduction in the supply of goods and services in the economy, which in turn can lead to a negative supply shock. \r\n\r\nFor example, if oil prices suddenly increase, it can lead to a reduction in the supply of goods and services such as transportation, heating, and other services that rely on oil. This can have a negative impact on economic growth and the overall health of the economy.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct explanation for this outcome is (B). \r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nA production possibility curve (PPC) shows the maximum amount of output that a nation can produce at any given level of input resources. It is based on the available factors of production (land, labor, and capital) and the technological potential of the nation. \r\n\r\nIf a nation is producing at a point inside of its PPC, it means that it is using a subset of its factors of production and technological potential to produce a certain level of output. This could be due to a number of reasons, but the most common explanation is that the nation has experienced slower than usual technological progress. \r\n\r\nSlower technological progress means that the nation has not been able to improve its technological potential as quickly as other nations. This could be due to a number of factors, such as a lack of investment in research and development, poor education and training, or a lack of access to new technologies and innovations. As a result, the nation is producing at a lower level of output than it could, given its available factors of production and technological potential. \r\n\r\nOther possible explanations for this outcome include (A) permanent decrease in production capacity, which means that the nation has lost factors of production or technological potential due to natural disasters, war, or other factors; (C) avoidance of free trade, which means that the nation has restricted trade with other nations, preventing it from taking advantage of economies of scale and specialization; and (D) economic recession, which means that the nation is experiencing a downturn in its economy, causing it to produce at a lower level of output than it could. However, these explanations are less likely to be the cause of the nation producing at a point inside of its PPC.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concepts of tariffs and quotas.\n\nTariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. They are used to protect domestic industries from foreign competition and to raise revenue for the government. When a country imposes a tariff on imported goods, it increases the price of those goods for consumers in that country. This means that domestic prices are higher as a result of tariffs.\n\nOn the other hand, quotas are limits placed on the amount of imported goods that can enter a country. They are used to protect domestic industries from foreign competition and to conserve resources. When a country imposes a quota on imported goods, it limits the amount of those goods that can be imported, which can lead to shortages and higher prices for consumers in that country. This means that domestic prices can be higher or lower as a result of quotas, depending on the specific situation.\n\nBased on this information, we can now answer the question:\n\n(A) result in higher domestic prices.\n\nTariffs and quotas can both result in higher domestic prices, but the effect can be different depending on the specific situation. Tariffs always increase the price of imported goods, while quotas can increase prices if imports are limited and there is a shortage of the imported good.\n\n(B) promote trade between nations.\n\nTariffs and quotas can both have the effect of promoting trade between nations. Tariffs can encourage domestic industries to produce more goods, which can lead to increased exports. Quotas can also encourage domestic industries to produce more goods, as they may need to increase production to meet the quota limit.\n\n(C) do not necessarily affect domestic prices.\n\nTariffs and quotas can both affect domestic prices, but the effect can be different depending on the specific situation. Tariffs always increase the price of imported goods, while quotas can increase prices if imports are limited and there is a shortage of the imported good.\n\n(D) affect domestic prices: the former raises them while the latter lowers them.\n\nTariffs always increase the price of imported goods, while quotas can increase prices if imports are limited and there is a shortage of the imported good.

This can lead to higher prices if there is a shortage of supply, or lower prices if there is an increase in supply. \r\n\r\nIf employment increases, it means that there are more jobs available, which can lead to higher wages and salaries. This can also lead to an increase in consumer spending, which can lead to higher prices. \r\n\r\nIf consumption increases, it means that people are spending more money on goods and services.
