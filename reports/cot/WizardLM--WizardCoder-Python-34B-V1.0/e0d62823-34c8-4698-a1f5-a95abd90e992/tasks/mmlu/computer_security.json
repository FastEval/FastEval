            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The difference between a direct leak and a side channel is that a direct leak is a type of vulnerability that exposes sensitive information by causing the system to leak data directly to an attacker, while a side channel attack exploits unintended information disclosures that occur as a side effect of the system's normal operation.\n\nIn a direct leak, the sensitive information is leaked directly to an attacker through the system's intended interaction mechanism, such as a network protocol or an API. For example, a direct leak could occur if a web application fails to properly sanitize user input and exposes sensitive data in an error message.\n\nOn the other hand, a side channel attack exploits unintended information disclosures that occur as a side effect of the system's normal operation. For example, a side channel attack could exploit differences in the timing or power consumption of the system when processing different inputs, or differences in the space usage of the system's memory when processing different inputs.\n\nIn summary, a direct leak occurs when sensitive information is leaked directly to an attacker through the system's intended interaction mechanism, while a side channel attack occurs when sensitive information is leaked indirectly as a side effect of the system's normal operation.",

            "model_answer": "The first buffer overflow attack was the Morris Worm, which was launched in 1988. It was a computer worm that spread through the ARPANET and infected many computers running the Berkeley UNIX operating system. The worm exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability in the finger program, which allowed it to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code. The attack caused significant damage to the ARPANET and led to the creation of the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nApps developed in languages like C, C++ are prone to Buffer-overflow because of the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. No string boundary checks in predefined functions: C and C++ languages have functions like strcpy(), strcat(), sprintf(), etc. which can be used to copy or concatenate strings. These functions do not perform any boundary checks, which means that if the destination buffer is not large enough to hold the source string, then the program will overwrite memory beyond the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\r\n\r\n2. No storage check in the external memory: C and C++ programs can allocate memory dynamically using functions like malloc(), calloc(), etc. These functions do not perform any storage checks, which means that if the program tries to access memory beyond the allocated space, then it can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\r\n\r\n3. No processing power check: C and C++ programs can perform complex operations that require a lot of processing power. If the program does not have enough processing power to handle these operations, then it can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\r\n\r\n4. No database check: C and C++ programs can interact with databases to store and retrieve data. If the program does not perform proper checks on the data retrieved from the database, then it can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).",
