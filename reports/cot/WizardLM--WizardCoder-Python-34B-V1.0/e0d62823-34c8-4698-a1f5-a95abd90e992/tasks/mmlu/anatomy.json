            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B). \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nA bilateral cleft palate occurs when the palatine and frontonasal processes fail to fuse together during development. This results in a separation of the hard palate and the soft palate, creating a cleft between them. \r\n\r\nThe palatine processes are the bony structures that form the roof of the mouth and connect the maxilla and mandible. The frontonasal processes are the bony structures that form the floor of the nose and connect the maxilla and mandible. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the failure of fusion of the palatine and frontonasal processes is the cause of a bilateral cleft palate. The secondary nasal processes and mandibular processes are not involved in the development of a bilateral cleft palate.",

In this case, the forearm is being bent toward the body, which is a flexion movement. \r\n\r\nAbduction refers to the movement of a joint or a part of the body away from the midline, while eversion refers to the movement of a joint or a part of the body in the opposite direction of the normal position.

            "model_answer": "The spheno-occipital synchondrosis is a condition that affects the growth of the sphenoid bone and the occipital bone in the back of the skull. It is characterized by the development of a bony growth, called a synchondrosis, on the sphenoid-occipital joint. This growth can cause pain and other symptoms, such as headaches and neck stiffness.\n\n(A) is a secondary growth cartilage.\n\nThe spheno-occipital synchondrosis is not a secondary growth cartilage.

The sphenoid bone is located in the front of the skull, while the occipital bone is located in the back of the skull.\n\n(B) influences the position of the viscerocranium.\n\nThe spheno-occipital synchondrosis can influence the position of the viscerocranium, which is the complex of bones and membranes that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord. The synchondrosis can cause the viscerocranium to shift, which can lead to headaches, neck stiffness, and other symptoms.\n\n(C) ceases activity at 7 years of age.\n\nThe spheno-occipital synchondrosis does not cease activity at 7 years of age. The condition can occur at any age, and it can continue to cause symptoms throughout a person's life.\n\n(D) can be reactivated in patients affected by acromegaly.\n\nThe spheno-occipital synchondrosis can be reactivated in patients affected by acromegaly, which is a condition that causes an excessive production of growth hormone. Acromegaly can cause the sphenoid bone to grow larger and the occipital bone to grow smaller, which can lead to the development of a synchondrosis.
