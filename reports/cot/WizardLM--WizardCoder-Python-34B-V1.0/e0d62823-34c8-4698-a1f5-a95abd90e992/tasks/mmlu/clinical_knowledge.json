            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) the right ventricle is relaxed. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nThe contraction of the left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta, which is a large artery that carries blood away from the heart to the rest of the body. As the left ventricle contracts, the aorta is also contracted, but not as much as the left ventricle. This is because the aorta is a much larger vessel than the left ventricle, and it takes time for the aorta to contract. \r\n\r\nOnce the aorta is contracted, the blood flows through the arteries that branch off the aorta. These arteries are also contracted, but not as much as the aorta. The arteries are also elastic, meaning they can stretch and contract. When the arteries contract, they squeeze the blood, which increases the pressure in the arteries. This pressure pushes the blood through the arteries to the tissues that need oxygen and nutrients. \r\n\r\nThe right ventricle is the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. When the left ventricle contracts, it pushes blood into the aorta, which pushes blood into the arteries. However, the right ventricle is not contracting at this point, so it is relaxed. This means that the pressure in the arteries is not as high as it would be if the right ventricle were also contracting. This allows the arteries to remain relaxed and elastic, which allows the blood to flow easily through them.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Graves Disease of the thyroid is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. It is characterized by the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) by the thyroid gland, which leads to an overactive thyroid. The disease is caused by the body's immune system attacking the thyroid gland, resulting in the destruction of thyroid tissue and the production of antibodies against thyroid cells.\n\n(A) It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia: True. Graves Disease can cause ophthalmoplegia, which is a condition that affects the muscles that control eye movement. Ophthalmoplegia can be caused by compression of the optic nerve, which is a nerve that connects the eye to the brain. In Graves Disease, the thyroid gland becomes overactive, which can cause swelling in the area around the optic nerve, leading to ophthalmoplegia.\n\n(B) It causes a large multi-nodular goitre: True. Graves Disease can cause a large, multi-nodular goitre, which is an enlargement of the thyroid gland. The goitre can be caused by the production of excessive thyroid hormones, which can cause the thyroid gland to swell. In Graves Disease, the thyroid gland becomes overactive, which can cause the goitre.\n\n(C) It is commoner in males than females: False. Graves Disease is actually more common in females than males. The reason for this is that females have a higher ratio of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to thyroxine (T4) than males, which makes them more sensitive to thyroid stimulation.\n\n(D) In the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck': False. Graves Disease can cause swelling in the neck, but it is not specifically called 'Derbyshire Neck'. The term 'Derbyshire Neck' refers to a specific type of goitre that is caused by iodine deficiency, not Graves Disease.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A). \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nA muscle fibre is a long, thin tube of muscle cells that contracts when stimulated by a nerve signal. When a muscle is at rest, the actin and myosin filaments in the muscle fibre are in a relaxed state, with the actin filaments wrapped around the myosin filaments. When a nerve signal stimulates the muscle, the signal causes the release of a neurotransmitter, which binds to receptors on the muscle cell membrane. This causes the membrane to depolarize, which causes the muscle cell to contract. The contraction is caused by a change in the alignment of the actin and myosin filaments, which causes the muscle fibre to shorten. When the nerve signal is removed, the muscle fibre returns to its resting state, with the actin and myosin filaments returning to their relaxed state. This is why a muscle fibre relaxes when the nerve stimulus is removed.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) failure of the ATP supply to match the demand. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nWhen we exercise at high intensity, our muscles require a continuous supply of energy to maintain contraction. This energy is provided by the breakdown of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate), which is a high energy phosphate molecule that is produced in our mitochondria and used as the primary source of energy in our cells. \r\n\r\nDuring exercise, our muscles require a large amount of ATP to maintain contraction. However, the rate at which ATP is produced in our mitochondria is limited. If the rate of ATP production cannot keep up with the rate of ATP usage, we will experience fatigue. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise is failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) Dopamine and acetyl choline.\n\nExplanation:\n\nFatigue is a common symptom experienced by many people, especially those who suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). CFS is a long-term illness that causes extreme fatigue, as well as other symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, and memory problems.\n\nThere are several factors that can contribute to fatigue development, including genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. However, one of the most common causes of fatigue is a deficiency in certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals between nerve cells, allowing the brain to communicate with other parts of the body.\n\nPharmacological agents are drugs that can affect the activity of neurotransmitters in the brain. There are several neurotransmitters that have been shown to play a role in fatigue development, including dopamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin.\n\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in regulating mood, motivation, and attention. It is also involved in the regulation of energy levels in the body. When dopamine levels are low, fatigue can develop.\n\nAcetylcholine is another neurotransmitter that is involved in regulating memory, attention, and learning. It is also involved in the regulation of muscle function and the transmission of nerve impulses. When acetylcholine levels are low, fatigue can develop.\n\nSerotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in regulating mood, appetite, and sleep. When serotonin levels are low, fatigue can develop.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Dopamine and acetyl choline, as these are the two neurotransmitters that have been shown to play a role in fatigue development.",

After exercise, phosphocreatine levels drop, and the body needs to replenish it. This process is called resynthesis.\r\n\r\nResynthesis of phosphocreatine occurs in the mitochondria, which are the powerhouses of the cell. During high-intensity exercise, the mitochondria produce large amounts of energy, which leads to an increase in the production of phosphocreatine. After exercise, the body needs to replenish the phosphocreatine stores, and this process takes time.\r\n\r\nThe time it takes for the body to resynthesize phosphocreatine after high-intensity exercise depends on several factors, including the intensity and duration of the exercise, the size and number of muscles used, and the individual's metabolism and recovery rate.\r\n\r\nIn general, resynthesis of phosphocreatine takes longer after intense exercise than after moderate exercise. However, the exact time it takes varies widely between individuals and depends on many factors.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\r\n\r\n(C) about 1 minute.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nSpastic paraplegia is a neurological condition that causes paralysis of the lower limbs. It is caused by damage to the spinal cord, which interrupts the communication between the brain and the muscles. The damage can be caused by a variety of factors, including multiple sclerosis, trauma, or infection.\r\n\r\n(A) Multiple Sclerosis can cause this neurological pattern: True. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, causing inflammation and demyelination of the myelin sheath that surrounds and insulates nerve fibers. This damage can lead to spastic paraplegia, as well as other neurological symptoms such as fatigue, numbness, and vision problems.\r\n\r\n(B) Proprioceptive loss is a common feature: True. Proprioception is the ability to sense the position and movement of the body and limbs. In spastic paraplegia, the damage to the spinal cord interferes with the signals that the brain receives from the muscles and joints, leading to a loss of proprioception. This can make it difficult to maintain balance and coordination, and can cause falls and accidents.\r\n\r\n(C) Coordination in the legs is affected: True. Spastic paraplegia causes paralysis of the lower limbs, which means that the muscles in the legs are unable to contract and move. This can make it difficult to walk or stand, and can cause falls and accidents. Coordination is also affected, as the paralyzed muscles cannot work together to move the legs in a coordinated way.\r\n\r\n(D) The tone is normal or flaccid: False. Spastic paraplegia is characterized by a stiff, tight, or \"spastic\" muscle tone. This means that the muscles are contracted and tense, and do not relax easily. The tone is not normal or flaccid, as it is the opposite of what is normally expected.",
