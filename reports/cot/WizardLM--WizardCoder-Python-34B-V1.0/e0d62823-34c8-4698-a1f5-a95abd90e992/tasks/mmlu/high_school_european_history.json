He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&\u2026[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&\u2026.\nOne day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&\u2026.She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron.

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nFirst we must remark that the cosmos is spherical in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one may say that Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos was based on\n\n(A) observation and induction\n(B) ancient textual authority\n(C) experimentation\n(D) deduction from first principles",

            "model_answer": "Step-by-step explanation:\r\n\r\n1. The question asks which of the following changes instituted by Robespierre was LEAST beneficial to the defense of France?\r\n2. The choices given are:\r\n   - (A) The conscription of huge armies\r\n   - (B) Fixing prices and wages\r\n   - (C) Pursuing a policy of de-Christianization\r\n   - (D) Promoting soldiers based upon their merits in the field\r\n3. To determine which of these changes was LEAST beneficial to the defense of France, we need to consider the following factors:\r\n   - (A) Conscription of huge armies: This was a necessary step to defend France during the revolutionary period. However, it also led to the excessive use of force and the abuse of power by the military leaders. This could have led to further instability and chaos in the country.\r\n   - (B) Fixing prices and wages: This was a necessary step to ensure that the people could afford basic necessities. However, it could have led to shortages and hoarding, which could have further weakened the economy and made it difficult for France to defend itself.\r\n   - (C) Pursuing a policy of de-Christianization: This was a divisive step that led to the persecution of the Catholic Church and the closure of many religious institutions. While it may have been necessary to establish a secular state, this could have led to further unrest and distrust among the people, which could have made it difficult for France to defend itself.\r\n   - (D) Promoting soldiers based upon their merits in the field: This was a positive step that recognized the bravery and skill of the soldiers and promoted them based on their performance. This could have led to a more efficient and effective military, which would have been beneficial to the defense of France.\r\n4. Based on these considerations, the answer is (D) Promoting soldiers based upon their merits in the field. This was the change that was LEAST beneficial to the defense of France, as it recognized the bravery and skill of the soldiers and promoted them based on their performance, leading to a more efficient and effective military.",

We then discoursed of the circulation of the blood, the valves in the veins, the venae lactae, the lymphatic vessels, the Copernican hypothesis, the nature of comets and new stars, the satellites of Jupiter, the oval shape (as it then appeared) of Saturn, the spots in the sun, and its turning on its own axis, the inequalities and selenography of the moon, the several phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes, and grinding of glasses for that purpose, the weight of air, the possibility, or impossibility of vacuities, and nature's abhorrence thereof, the Torricellian experiment in quicksilver, the descent of heavy bodies, and the degrees of acceleration therein; and divers other things of like nature.

The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger.
