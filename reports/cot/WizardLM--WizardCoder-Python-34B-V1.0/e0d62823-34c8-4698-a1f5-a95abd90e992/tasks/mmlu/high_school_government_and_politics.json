            "model_answer": "Appellate courts are courts of review, meaning they review the decisions of lower courts and determine whether or not the lower court's decision was correct. Therefore, the correct answer is (D). \n\n(A) Appellate judges never use the stare decisis principle. This is false. Appellate courts do use the stare decisis principle, which means they tend to follow precedents set by previous cases.\n\n(B) Appellate trials are usually jury trials. This is false. Appellate courts do not conduct trials, they only review the decisions of lower courts.\n\n(C) Appellate judges usually decide the facts of a case. This is false. Appellate courts do not decide the facts of a case, they only review the decisions of lower courts.\n\n(D) Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts. This is true.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) Peace Corps. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nThe Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 was a plan created by President Roosevelt to reorganize the government and reduce the number of government agencies. The plan created the Peace Corps, which was responsible for administering foreign aid programs. \r\n\r\nExecutive Order 8248 was issued by President Roosevelt in 1941, during World War II. The order allowed the president to select the staff for various government agencies, including the Peace Corps. \r\n\r\nThe White House Office, Senate Committee on Appropriations, and Cabinet are all government agencies that were not created or reorganized by the Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 or Executive Order 8248. Therefore, the president could not select the staff for these agencies using these orders.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The principle realized when the federal government provides most of the funding to a project in which multiple levels of government work together is:\n\n(B) Fiscal federalism\n\nExplanation:\n\nFiscal federalism is the principle that the federal government should be responsible for funding a large portion of the costs of a project that involves multiple levels of government. This principle ensures that the federal government takes on the primary responsibility for funding the project, while the other levels of government contribute according to their respective abilities and capacities. This helps to ensure that the project is completed efficiently and effectively, and that all levels of government share in the benefits that result from the project.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The No Child Left Behind Act is an example of a federal mandate. \n\nExplanation: \n\nThe No Child Left Behind Act was a law passed by Congress in 2001 that required states to improve their education systems or face the loss of federal funding. It was part of a larger effort by the Bush administration to improve education in the United States. The law set specific goals for improving student achievement, and it required states to develop and implement accountability systems to measure student progress. The law also established new standards for teacher quality and school performance, and it provided incentives for schools that met certain performance benchmarks. \n\nThe law was a federal mandate because it required states to meet specific educational standards in order to receive federal funding. It was not a constitutional amendment, because it did not change the Constitution itself. It was not affirmative action, because it did not give any group of people a leg up in the educational system. It was not tort reform, because it did not change the way lawsuits are handled in the United States.",

            "model_answer": "The significant difference between the Senate and the House of Representatives is that only the Senate may introduce revenue bills. \r\n\r\n(B) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nThe Senate and the House of Representatives are the two chambers of the United States Congress. Each chamber has its own unique powers and responsibilities. \r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives is directly elected by the people of the United States. Each state is represented in the House by a fixed number of representatives, regardless of the state's population. The House of Representatives has the power to introduce and pass legislation, including laws that raise revenue for the federal government. However, the House does not have the power to propose revenue bills. \r\n\r\nThe Senate, on the other hand, is indirectly elected by the state legislatures. Each state is represented in the Senate by a number of senators proportional to its population. The Senate has the power to propose and pass laws, including revenue bills. The Senate also has the power to amend bills passed by the House, and it can filibuster bills passed by the House to prevent them from becoming law. \r\n\r\nIn summary, the House of Representatives may introduce and pass legislation, but it cannot propose revenue bills. The Senate, on the other hand, may propose and pass revenue bills, but it cannot directly elect its members. Therefore, the significant difference between the Senate and the House of Representatives is that only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) peer pressure. \r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nPeople who join a political party other than the one to which their parents belong most often do so because they are influenced by their peers. This is because political parties often have strong ties to their supporters, and joining a party can be a way for individuals to feel like they belong to a group and have a sense of belonging. Additionally, individuals may be influenced by their peers to join a political party that aligns with their own values and beliefs, rather than the party that their parents supported. This can be especially true for younger generations who may have different political views than their parents.",
