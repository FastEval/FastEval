The force is given as F = (-1, 0, 1), and the displacement of the particle is given by the vector equation (t, t^2, t^3) between time t=0 and time t=1.\n\nFirst, we need to parameterize the path using t.

The work done by the force between time t=0 and time t=1 is given by the integral of the dot product of the force and the velocity vector from t=0 to t=1:\n\nW = integral(from t=0 to t=1) F(t) dot v(t) dt\n\nSince F is a constant unit force, we can simplify the dot product to F dot v = -1.

In other words, P is an idempotent transformation.\n\nNow, let's consider each of the options:\n\nI. P is invertible.\n\nIf P is invertible, then we know that there exists a linear transformation P^-1 such that P^-1 * P = I, where I is the identity transformation. However, since P^2 = P, we have that P * P = P, which implies that P * (P^-1 * P) = P * I = P. Therefore, P^-1 * P = P, which means that P^-1 is the identity transformation. This contradicts the fact that P^-1 is invertible, so we can conclude that P is not invertible.\n\nII. P is diagonalizable.\n\nIf P is diagonalizable, then there exists a basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of P. However, since P^2 = P, we have that P * v = P(P(v)) = P(v) = P^2(v) = P(v) for any vector v in V. This means that P acts as the identity transformation on each eigenvector, which implies that the corresponding eigenvalue is 1. Therefore, the only possible eigenvalue of P is 1, and the corresponding eigenspace has dimension equal to the rank of P.\n\nIII. P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation.\n\nIf P is the identity transformation, then P^2 = P, which is true.

The sign changes occur at the following positions: \n\n2, 0, -8, 0, 0, -7\n\nThere are three sign changes, so the polynomial has at most three real roots. However, we also need to check if there are any repeated roots. To do this, we can use the rational root theorem, which states that if a polynomial has a rational root, then it must be a factor of the constant term. In this case, the constant term is -7, so the possible rational roots are -1, 1, and 7. We can then use polynomial division to check if any of these roots are factors of the polynomial. If we divide the polynomial by (x+1), we get:\n\n2x^4 + 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 8x - 7\n\nThe remainder is not zero, so -1 is not a root.

Therefore, the center must be trivial, and the subgroups of order 7 must be conjugate. Since conjugate subgroups have the same order, all subgroups of order 7 must be isomorphic, and there must be exactly one conjugacy class of subgroups of order 7. This means that there is a unique subgroup of order 7, and it is normal. But we are given that G does not contain any element of order 14, so this is not possible.\n\n3. If the order of G is 21, then it is not cyclic and the subgroups of order 7 must be normal. Since the center of G has order 1 or 7, the center cannot contain any element of order 21. Therefore, the center must be trivial, and the subgroups of order 7 must be conjugate. Since conjugate subgroups have the same order, all subgroups of order 7 must be isomorphic, and there must be exactly one conjugacy class of subgroups of order 7. This means that there is a unique subgroup of order 7, and it is normal. But we are given that G does not contain any element of order 21, so this is not possible.\n\n4. If the order of G is 28, then it is not cyclic and the subgroups of order 7 must be normal. Since the center of G has order 1 or 7, the center cannot contain any element of order 28. Therefore, the center must be trivial, and the subgroups of order 7 must be conjugate. Since conjugate subgroups have the same order, all subgroups of order 7 must be isomorphic, and there must be exactly one conjugacy class of subgroups of order 7. This means that there is a unique subgroup of order 7, and it is normal. But we are given that G does not contain any element of order 28, so this is not possible.\n\n5. If the order of G is 35, then it is not cyclic and the subgroups of order 7 must be normal. Since the center of G has order 1 or 7, the center cannot contain any element of order 35. Therefore, the center must be trivial, and the subgroups of order 7 must be conjugate. Since conjugate subgroups have the same order, all subgroups of order 7 must be isomorphic, and there must be exactly one conjugacy class of subgroups of order 7. This means that there is a unique subgroup of order 7, and it is normal. But we are given that G does not contain any element of order 35, so this is not possible.\n\n6. If the order of G is 37, then it is not cyclic and the subgroups of order 7 must be normal. Since the center of G has order 1 or 7, the center cannot contain any element of order 37. Therefore, the center must be trivial, and the subgroups of order 7 must be conjugate. Since conjugate subgroups have the same order, all subgroups of order 7 must be isomorphic, and there must be exactly one conjugacy class of subgroups of order 7. This means that there is a unique subgroup of order 7, and it is normal. But we are given that G does not contain any element of order 37, so this is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the order of G cannot be 28, 35, or 37. The only remaining possibility is that the order of G is 27, which is the LCM of 7 and 1.",
