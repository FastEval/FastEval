            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The body compensates for increased environmental temperature by increasing water lost through skin. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nWhen the body is exposed to increased environmental temperature, it tries to cool itself down by increasing its metabolic rate, which leads to increased respiration and heart rate. However, these methods are not very effective in cooling the body down when the temperature is too high. Therefore, the body resorts to other methods to cool itself down, such as increasing water lost through skin. This is because when the body sweats, it loses water and heat, which helps to cool the body down. Additionally, when the body loses water through its skin, it also loses salt, which can lead to decreased salt retention in the body. However, decreasing salt retention is not the primary method used by the body to cool itself down in response to increased environmental temperature.",

            "model_answer": "The main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is:\r\n\r\n(A) conversion to urea in the liver.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nLactate is a metabolic byproduct of muscle metabolism. It is produced when the body breaks down glucose for energy. When the body needs energy, it breaks down glucose into pyruvate, which is then converted into lactate. Lactate is then transported to the liver, where it is converted into urea. Urea is then excreted in the urine, where it is filtered out by the kidneys. The liver is the main organ responsible for removing lactate from the blood and converting it into urea. Therefore, the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is conversion to urea in the liver.",

The enzyme responsible for transcription is called RNA polymerase.\r\n4. RNA polymerase binds to the promoter region of a DNA sequence and initiates the transcription process.\r\n5. The transcription process involves the addition of nucleotides to the growing RNA chain.\r\n6. The cytosol is the location of most of the cell's ribosomes, which are responsible for protein synthesis.\r\n7. The transcription process occurs in the cytosol, where RNA polymerase is located.\r\n8.

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) genetically determined. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nIn a double stranded molecule of DNA, the ratio of purines (adenine and guanine) to pyrimidines (thymine and cytosine) is genetically determined. This means that the ratio is determined by the sequence of bases in the DNA strands, which is determined by the genetic information passed down from the parent cells. The ratio cannot be changed by any external factors, such as the environment or the cell's metabolism. Therefore, the answer is not (A) variable, nor (B) determined by the base sequence in RNA, nor (D) always 1:1.",

However, none of these strategies are directly related to the specific process described in the question. \r\n\r\nElaborative rehearsal, on the other hand, is a memory strategy that involves actively relating new information to previously learned information.

            "model_answer": "The first molecule to be depleted when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell is water (C). \r\n\r\nWater is a necessary component for cellular metabolism, and its production requires energy. When oxygen is no longer available, the cell cannot generate energy through aerobic respiration, which is the primary source of energy for most cells. As a result, the cell will eventually run out of energy and be unable to produce water. \r\n\r\nThe other molecules (A, B, and D) can be produced without oxygen, but they are not essential for cellular metabolism. Oxaloacetate (A) is a non-essential amino acid that can be produced from other amino acids when needed. Pyruvate (B) is a byproduct of glycolysis, which is the primary pathway for glucose metabolism. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (D) is a molecule that stores energy in the form of chemical bonds.

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D). \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nBlood lactate concentration is a measure of the amount of lactate in the blood. Lactate is a byproduct of energy metabolism and is produced when muscles are working hard. In endurance sports like soccer, the blood lactate concentration rises as the players become more fatigued during the course of the game. This is because as the players become more fatigued, their muscles begin to produce more lactate as they work harder to maintain their energy levels. Therefore, the blood lactate concentration increases throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued. \r\n\r\nThe other options are incorrect because they do not describe the relationship between the blood lactate concentration and the course of the game. \r\n\r\nOption (A) states that the blood lactate concentration rarely increases above 3 mM, which is a very low value. This is not consistent with the fact that the blood lactate concentration typically increases as the players become more fatigued. \r\n\r\nOption (B) states that the blood lactate concentration is usually lower at the end of the game than at the end of the first half. This is not consistent with the fact that the players become more fatigued as the game progresses, which should lead to an increase in the blood lactate concentration. \r\n\r\nOption (C) states that the blood lactate concentration is usually higher at the end of the game than at the end of the first half.
