This means that after 10 hours, the population of bacteria will be 200 * 3 = 600.\n\nNext, we need to find the rate of growth of the bacteria. The rate of growth is the amount by which the population increases in a given time period.

We are given that the LCM divided by the GCD is equal to 33. We can use this information to find the GCD and then find the other integer.\n\nFirst, let's find the GCD. We know that the LCM is equal to the product of the two integers divided by their GCD. So, if we let the two integers be x and y, we have:\n\nLCM = (x * y) / GCD\n\nMultiplying both sides by GCD, we get:\n\nLCM * GCD = x * y\n\nDividing both sides by LCM, we get:\n\nGCD = (x * y) / LCM\n\nNow, we are given that the LCM divided by the GCD is equal to 33. So, we can substitute this value in the above equation to get:\n\nGCD = (x * y) / 33\n\nMultiplying both sides by 33, we get:\n\n33 * GCD = x * y\n\nDividing both sides by 33, we get:\n\nGCD = (x * y) / 33\n\nNow, we are given that one of the integers is 45.

So, we can write:\n\nGCD = k * y\n\nwhere k is some integer factor of the GCD.\n\nSubstituting this value in the above equation, we get:\n\n9 * (k * y) = y\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n9 * k = 1\n\nSince k is an integer, the only possible value is k = 1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nGCD = y\n\nNow, we know that the LCM is equal to the product of the two integers divided by their GCD.

So, we have:\n\nLCM = x * y\n\nSubstituting the value of LCM, we get:\n\nx * y = 33 * y\n\nDividing both sides by y, we get:\n\nx = 33\n\nSo, the other integer is 33.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 46.",

Since $abc = 180$, we know that at least one of $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be $2$ or $3$. The other two numbers can be any of the six numbers on a standard die, but they must multiply to $90$ when combined with the $2$ or $3$. \n\nTherefore, the possible combinations of $a$, $b$, and $c$ are:\n\n- $2$, $3$, $3 \\times 2 = 6$\n- $2$, $3$, $3 \\times 4 = 12$\n- $2$, $3$, $3 \\times 5 = 15$\n- $2$, $3$, $3 \\times 6 = 18$\n- $2$, $3$, $3 \\times 9 = 27$\n- $3$, $2$, $2 \\times 3 = 6$\n- $3$, $2$, $2 \\times 4 = 8$\n- $3$, $2$, $2 \\times 5 = 10$\n- $3$, $2$, $2 \\times 6 = 12$\n- $3$, $2$, $2 \\times 9 = 18$\n\nNow, let's consider the probability of each of these combinations. The probability of rolling a $2$ or a $3$ on any one die is $1/2$, since there are two numbers on a standard die that multiply to $2$ or $3$. Therefore, the probability of rolling a $2$ or a $3$ on any one of the three dice is $1/2 \\times 1/2 \\times 1/2 = 1/8$.\n\nThe probability of rolling a $6$ on any one die is $1/6$, since there is only one number on a standard die that multiplies to $6$. Therefore, the probability of rolling a $6$ on any one of the three dice is $1/6 \\times 1/6 \\times 1/6 = 1/216$.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability of each combination by multiplying the probabilities of rolling the required numbers on each die. For example, the probability of rolling a $2$, a $3$, and a $6$ is $1/8 \\times 1/8 \\times 1/216 = 1/1664$.\n\nSumming up the probabilities of all possible combinations, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1664} + \\frac{1}{1664} + \\frac{1}{1664} + \\frac{1}{1664} + \\frac{1}{1664} + \\frac{1}{1664} + \\frac{1}{1664} + \\frac{1}{1664} + \\frac{1}{1664} + \\frac{1}{1664} = \\frac{12}{1664} = \\frac{1}{140}$$\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling three standard dice and getting a product of $180$ is $\\frac{1}{140}$.",
