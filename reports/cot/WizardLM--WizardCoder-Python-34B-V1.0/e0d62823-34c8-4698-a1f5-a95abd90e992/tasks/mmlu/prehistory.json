            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) prognathous. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nHaving a forward-thrusting lower face refers to the lower jaw (mandible) projecting forward from the face. This is a characteristic of many animals, including many types of reptiles, birds, and mammals. \r\n\r\nArboreal refers to living in trees, which is not the case here. \r\n\r\nDiastema refers to a gap between the teeth, which is not the case here. \r\n\r\nMandible refers to the lower jaw, which is correct. However, the question asks for the term used to describe this characteristic, not the name of the bone itself. \r\n\r\nPrognathous is the correct term for an animal with a forward-thrusting lower face. It comes from the Greek words pro (forward) and gnathos (jaw), and literally means \"forward-jawed\".",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The Levallois technology involved a shift in emphasis from producing core tools to producing flakes. This is because the Levallois technique was used to create small flakes of stone, which were then used to make tools and other artifacts. The flakes were created by chipping away at a large stone until it was reduced to small, usable pieces. This technique allowed for more efficient use of raw materials and a greater variety of tools and artifacts to be created.",

Primatologists use a variety of methods, including field observations, laboratory experiments, and genetic analysis, to understand the behavior and ecology of primates and how they differ from other animals.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The wild progenitor of maize is teosinte. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nMaize is a domesticated crop that is widely cultivated across the globe. It is a grass that belongs to the genus Zea, which is a member of the Poaceae family. The wild progenitor of maize refers to the original ancestor of the domesticated maize that was cultivated by ancient civilizations in Mesoamerica. \r\n\r\nThe three most common candidates for the wild progenitor of maize are einkorn, emmer, and teosinte. \r\n\r\nEinkorn is a species of wheat that is closely related to maize. However, it is not a direct ancestor of maize, as it belongs to a different genus (Triticum) and family (Poaceae). \r\n\r\nEmmer is another species of wheat that is closely related to einkorn. However, it is also not a direct ancestor of maize, as it belongs to a different genus (Triticum) and family (Poaceae). \r\n\r\nTeosinte, on the other hand, is a species of grass that belongs to the genus Zea, which is a member of the Poaceae family. It is the most likely candidate for the wild progenitor of maize, as it is native to Mesoamerica and has been found in archaeological sites dating back to 7000 BC. Teosinte is also the only wild grass species that is closely related to maize and has the same genetic makeup.",

Cattle are domesticated animals that are used for meat, milk, and other products. \r\n\r\nArchaeological evidence suggests that cattle were first domesticated in sub-Saharan Africa, about 8,500 years ago. This is based on the discovery of fossil bones of domesticated cattle in the Lake Chad basin, which are the oldest known remains of domesticated cattle. \r\n\r\nThe earliest evidence of cattle domestication in western Europe is about 3,500 years ago, which is much later than in Africa. Cattle were also domesticated in North America about 9,500 years ago, and in the Middle East about 10,500 years ago. However, these later domestications were likely independent events, as cattle were not widely used in the Americas or the Middle East until later times.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D). Here's the reasoning:\n\nThe Younger Dryas is a period of environmental change that caused humans to temporarily abandon much of northern Europe. This is supported by the fact that it was a period of glacial retreat, which would have caused a significant change in the environment. Additionally, it is known that humans were present in northern Europe during the Pleistocene, but they were forced to abandon much of the region during the Younger Dryas. This is supported by archaeological evidence showing a decrease in human activity during this time.",

The temples were the places where the gods were worshipped and the priests performed rituals to please the gods.

            "model_answer": "The hypothesis that is most supported by recent research with stone tool replication and brain imaging is (A) connections made in tool making prepared the brain for the production and use of language. This is because tool making requires complex cognitive abilities such as planning, visualization, and problem-solving, which are thought to be enhanced by language. Additionally, the brain regions involved in tool making and language are thought to be connected, and the development of language may have helped to prepare the brain for tool making.",
