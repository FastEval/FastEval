            "question": "Do individuals (physical) persons enjoy international legal personality in the same manner as States and international organisations?\n\n(A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited\n(B) Individuals enjoy unlimited international legal personality\n(C) Individuals do not enjoy any international legal personality\n(D) Individuals can only bring claims before international courts",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Individuals (physical) persons enjoy international legal personality in the same manner as States and international organisations. However, this is limited in comparison to the legal personality enjoyed by States and international organisations. \r\n\r\nThe limited nature of individuals' international legal personality can be explained by the following factors:\r\n\r\n1. The lack of a permanent legal identity: Individuals do not have a permanent legal identity that can be recognised by international courts. This is because individuals' legal identity is dependent on their nationality and the laws of the country where they reside. As a result, individuals cannot be sued or held liable in international courts unless they have a permanent legal identity that can be recognised by international courts.\r\n\r\n2. The lack of a unified legal system: Individuals do not have a unified legal system that can be applied to their actions across different countries. This is because the laws that apply to individuals differ from country to country, and individuals are subject to different laws depending on the country where they reside. As a result, individuals cannot be sued or held liable in international courts for actions that violate the laws of one country, if those actions do not violate the laws of another country where the individual resides.\r\n\r\n3. The lack of a unified legal system: Individuals do not have a unified legal system that can be applied to their actions across different countries. This is because the laws that apply to individuals differ from country to country, and individuals are subject to different laws depending on the country where they reside. As a result, individuals cannot be sued or held liable in international courts for actions that violate the laws of one country, if those actions do not violate the laws of another country where the individual resides.\r\n\r\n4.

As a result, individuals cannot be sued or held liable in international courts for actions that violate the laws of one country, if those actions do not violate the laws of another country where the individual resides.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, individuals enjoy limited international legal personality in comparison to States and international organisations. This is due to the lack of a permanent legal identity, a unified legal system, and the different laws that apply to individuals depending on the country where they reside.",

This means that the group has the right to act as a single entity, with its own interests and concerns, and that it can assert those interests and concerns collectively, rather than only as individuals. Collective rights can include a range of different rights, such as the right to free association, the right to strike, or the right to self-determination.",

            "model_answer": "The fundamental premise of monist theory is that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order. This means that both sets of laws are considered equally valid and binding, and that they do not contradict each other. Monist theory holds that there is only one system of law that applies to all people and all situations, regardless of their nationality or location. Therefore, when interpreting a law or a legal issue, both international and domestic laws must be taken into account, and any conflicts between them must be resolved in a way that is consistent with the overall principles of the legal system.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The living instrument principle refers to the idea that the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a \"living instrument\" that should be interpreted and applied in a way that is consistent with its evolving understanding of human rights. This principle is based on the idea that the ECHR should be interpreted and applied in a way that is consistent with its purpose and values, and that it should be developed and improved over time to reflect changing social and political conditions.\n\nIn order to determine which case best illustrates the living instrument principle, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. The nature of the case: The case should involve an interpretation or application of the ECHR that demonstrates the living instrument principle.\n\n2. The evolution of the law: The case should involve a change in the law that reflects an evolving understanding of human rights.\n\n3. The role of the Court: The case should involve the Court's interpretation or application of the ECHR in a way that reflects its evolving understanding of human rights.\n\nBased on these factors, the case that best illustrates the living instrument principle is:\n\n(B) A v UK (2009)\n\nIn this case, the Court considered the right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 of the ECHR. The applicant, a lesbian couple, had applied for recognition of their relationship as a family for the purposes of various benefits, such as inheritance rights. The Court held that the right to respect for private and family life includes the right to form a family with a person of the same sex, and that this right is protected under Article 8. The Court's interpretation of Article 8 reflected an evolving understanding of human rights, as it expanded the definition of the family to include same-sex couples. This case demonstrates the living instrument principle, as the Court's interpretation of the ECHR reflected its evolving understanding of human rights.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The doctrine of incorporation suggests that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law. This means that once a treaty is ratified by the required number of countries, it becomes part of the domestic law of all those countries that have ratified it. This is because treaties are considered to be superior to domestic law, and so any laws that conflict with the provisions of a treaty must be repealed or amended to comply with the treaty. Therefore, the doctrine of incorporation does not require any further action at the domestic level, as ratified treaties are immediately incorporated into domestic law.",
