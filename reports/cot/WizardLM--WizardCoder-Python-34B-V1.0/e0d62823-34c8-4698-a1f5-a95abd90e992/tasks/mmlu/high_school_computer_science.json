            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A). \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nA program is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. These instructions are written in a programming language, which is a human-readable language that can be easily understood by programmers. However, computers do not understand programming languages directly. Instead, they understand binary code, which is a language of 0s and 1s that represents data and instructions. \r\n\r\nTo run a program, the programming language must be compiled or interpreted into binary code. This process involves translating the programming language into a form that the computer can understand. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of using a higher-level programming language is that it is more concise and easier to read than binary code. This makes it easier for programmers to write and maintain code. Additionally, higher-level programming languages can provide abstractions that make programming easier, such as object-oriented programming or functional programming. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, binary code is more efficient and can be executed more quickly by the computer. However, it is more difficult for humans to read and understand. Therefore, it is generally more efficient to write code in a higher-level programming language and then compile or interpret it into binary code for execution.",

The compiler also provides error messages and warnings to help the programmer identify and fix any issues in their code.
