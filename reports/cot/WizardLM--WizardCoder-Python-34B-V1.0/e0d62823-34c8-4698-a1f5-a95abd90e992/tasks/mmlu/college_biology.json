            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B). Mycorrhizal fungi confer several benefits to plants, but one of the most important is that they fix nitrogen. Nitrogen is an essential element for plant growth, but it is often limited in the soil. Mycorrhizal fungi form a symbiotic relationship with the plant roots, allowing the fungi to access the nutrients in the soil and transfer them to the plant. This enables the plant to access more nitrogen than it would otherwise be able to, leading to increased growth and productivity.",

It is located in the cytoplasm and consists of a series of stacked cisternae that are connected by tubular interconnections. The cis face of the Golgi is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum, and the trans face is closest to the cytosol. \r\n\r\n(A) is incorrect because the cis face of the Golgi is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum, not the other way around. \r\n\r\n(B) is incorrect because the Golgi apparatus is not typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face. Rather, these vesicles are formed in the endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the Golgi for further modification. \r\n\r\n(C) is incorrect because the cisternae of the Golgi are not continuous with one another. Rather, they are stacked and separated by interconnections. \r\n\r\n(D) is correct because glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs prior to the protein's entry into the Golgi lumen. This is because the glycosylation reactions require a specific environment that is provided by the Golgi.

The inhibitor can bind to the active site either reversibly or irreversibly. If it binds irreversibly, it prevents the substrate from binding to the active site, effectively inhibiting the enzyme's activity. \r\n\r\nThe correct answer is (B) because a competitive inhibitor irreversibly modifies some of the amino acid residues that help to comprise the enzyme's active site. This modification prevents the substrate from binding to the active site, thus inhibiting the enzyme's activity. \r\n\r\n(A) is incorrect because a competitive inhibitor does not form covalent links with the enzyme. Instead, it binds to the enzyme's active site, which is a separate molecule from the enzyme itself. \r\n\r\n(C) is incorrect because a competitive inhibitor does not compete with the substrate molecule for the same enzyme.

In this case, the antibiotics are affecting bacterial cells by interfering with their ability to synthesize peptidoglycan, produce proteins, replicate their DNA, or reverse transcribe their RNA. \r\n\r\nPeptidoglycan synthesis is not affected by antibiotics because it is essential for bacterial cell wall structure and integrity. Bacterial cells need to produce peptidoglycan to maintain their shape and prevent the leakage of cell contents. Therefore, antibiotics cannot interfere with this process. \r\n\r\nProtein synthesis is affected by antibiotics because it is essential for bacterial survival. Bacterial cells need to produce proteins to carry out various functions, including metabolism, growth, and reproduction. Antibiotics target the ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis, and inhibit their function. \r\n\r\nDNA synthesis is affected by antibiotics because it is essential for bacterial survival. Bacterial cells need to replicate their DNA to ensure the survival of the cell and the transfer of genetic information to daughter cells during cell division. Antibiotics target DNA polymerases, which are essential for DNA synthesis, and inhibit their function. \r\n\r\nReverse transcriptase is affected by antibiotics because it is essential for bacterial survival. Bacterial cells need to reverse transcribe their RNA to produce DNA, which is then used for DNA synthesis.

The question asks which of the following experimental observations would be expected.\n\nOptions (A) and (C) involve blocking the binding of ZP3 receptors to ZP3, which would prevent the sperm\u2019s acrosomal reaction and inhibit in vitro fertilization.

Therefore, this option is expected.\n\nOption (D) involves coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2.
