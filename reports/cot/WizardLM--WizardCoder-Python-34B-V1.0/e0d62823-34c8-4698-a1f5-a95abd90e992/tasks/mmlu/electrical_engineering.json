            "model_answer": "Induction heating takes place in (D) conducting and magnetic materials. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nInduction heating is a process where a conductor is heated by an electromagnetic field generated by an external source. The conductor must be made of a material that is both conductive and magnetic. \r\n\r\nConducting but non-magnetic materials do not work for induction heating because they are not magnetic. Insulating materials are also not magnetic, so they do not work for induction heating. Conducting and non-magnetic materials do not work for induction heating because they are not magnetic. Therefore, the only option that satisfies both conductivity and magnetism is (D) conducting and magnetic materials.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Both A and B.\n\nExplanation:\n\nInduction furnaces use electromagnetic induction to heat the metal. The electromagnetic field generated by the primary winding of the transformer induces eddy currents in the molten metal. These eddy currents generate heat in the metal, which is used to melt and cast the metal.\n\nHowever, if the frequency of the supply is too high, the eddy currents will cause severe stirring action in the molten metal. This stirring action will prevent the molten metal from settling properly, which can cause air bubbles to form in the metal. These bubbles can reduce the quality of the cast metal and affect its mechanical properties.\n\nOn the other hand, if the frequency of the supply is too low, the magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuit of the transformer will be poor. This will result in a lower magnetic flux density in the core, which will reduce the heating efficiency of the induction furnace.\n\nTherefore, to optimize the heating process in an induction furnace, a low frequency supply is necessary to avoid both severe stirring action and poor magnetic coupling.",

Since the cube is a conductor, all the charge on the metal surface will be redistributed on the inner surface of the cube.

This is the current that the thyristor will pass through the load when it is turned on. The trigger current is the current required to trigger the thyristor. The gate charge is the charge required to trigger the thyristor. The load resistance is the resistance of the load.\r\n\r\nTo determine the latching current, we need to consider the trigger current and the gate charge. The latching current is the current that will flow through the gate of the thyristor to trigger it. This current is determined by the gate charge and the gate resistance. The gate resistance is determined by the load resistance and the trigger current. Therefore, we can calculate the latching current as follows:\r\n\r\nLatching current = Gate charge / (Gate resistance x Load resistance)\r\n\r\nGate charge = 0.001 C (typical value)\r\n\r\nGate resistance = (Vt - Vd) / (It - Id) (where Vt is the trigger voltage, Vd is the gate-to-anode voltage, It is the trigger current, and Id is the holding current)\r\n\r\nLoad resistance = RL (where RL is the resistance of the load)\r\n\r\nSubstituting the values, we get:\r\n\r\nLatching current = 0.001 C / ((Vt - Vd) / (It - Id) x RL)\r\n\r\nSince the holding current is 2 mA, we can assume that the trigger current is also around 2 mA. Therefore, It - Id = 2 mA. Also, Vt is typically around 1.5 V, Vd is typically around 1 V, and RL is the resistance of the load. Substituting these values, we get:\r\n\r\nLatching current = 0.001 C / ((1.5 V - 1 V) / 2 mA x RL)\r\n\r\nLatching current = 0.001 C / (0.5 V / 2 mA x RL)\r\n\r\nLatching current = 0.001 C / (0.25 mA x RL)\r\n\r\nLatching current = 0.004 A\r\n\r\nTherefore, the latching current is 0.004 A.",
