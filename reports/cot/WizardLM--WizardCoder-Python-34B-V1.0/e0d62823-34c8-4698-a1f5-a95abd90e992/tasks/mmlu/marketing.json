            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Aesthetic realm. \r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nAn individual who passively appreciates an event or environment is said to be in the aesthetic realm. This is because they are experiencing the event or environment through their senses, primarily their sight and sound, and are taking in the beauty and aesthetic value of the environment. They are not actively participating in the environment or affecting its nature in any way. \r\n\r\nAn individual who is in the aesthetic realm is not necessarily escaping from reality or trying to avoid dealing with difficult issues. They are simply experiencing the environment through their senses and taking in its beauty and aesthetic value. \r\n\r\nAn individual who is in the aesthetic realm is not necessarily trying to learn anything new or educate themselves. They are simply experiencing the environment through their senses and taking in its beauty and aesthetic value. \r\n\r\nAn individual who is in the aesthetic realm is not necessarily trying to entertain themselves or others.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C). Here's the reasoning:\n\nThe question asks for a step-by-step explanation of why economic marketing should encourage long-term economic development as opposed to short-term economic development.\n\n1. Economic marketing is a subset of marketing that focuses on the economic aspects of marketing, such as pricing, distribution, and promotion.\n\n2. Long-term economic development refers to economic growth and progress that occurs over a period of years or decades, rather than over a shorter time frame.\n\n3. Short-term economic development refers to economic growth and progress that occurs over a shorter time frame, such as a few months or years.\n\n4. Encouraging long-term economic development is desirable because it leads to economic stability and prosperity, which benefits both individuals and societies.\n\n5. Encouraging short-term economic development can be tempting because it can lead to quick profits and increased sales, but it can also have negative consequences, such as economic instability, inequality, and environmental degradation.\n\n6. Ecological marketing focuses on the relationship between business and the environment, and encourages businesses to consider the impact of their activities on the natural world.\n\n7. Evolutionary marketing focuses on the evolution of consumer behavior and the changing needs and wants of consumers over time.\n\n8. Equitable marketing focuses on ensuring that economic opportunities are available and accessible to all members of society, regardless of their background or status.\n\n9. Emerging marketing refers to the development of new markets and opportunities in emerging economies, such as those in developing countries.\n\n10. Therefore, economic marketing should encourage long-term economic development by incorporating ecological, evolutionary, and equitable principles. This approach will help ensure that economic growth is sustainable and benefits all members of society.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Service economy. \r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nCustomer experience refers to the way a customer interacts with a company or brand. It involves the overall impression that a customer has after interacting with a company. This includes the quality of products or services, the level of customer service, and the overall satisfaction that the customer feels after using the product or service. \r\n\r\nThe importance and significance of customer experience is significant because it has a direct impact on the success of a business. Companies that provide excellent customer experience tend to have higher customer loyalty and retention rates, which leads to increased sales and profits. In addition, customer experience can have a significant impact on the reputation of a company, which can lead to increased brand awareness and recognition. \r\n\r\nThe term \"service economy\" refers to an economy that is based on providing services to customers. This includes industries such as healthcare, finance, and tourism, where the primary product or service is not a physical good, but rather a service that is provided to customers. The service economy is becoming increasingly important as technology advances and the world becomes more service-oriented. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the importance and significance of customer experience is referred to as the service economy because it is based on providing excellent services to customers, which is essential for the success of a business.",

            "model_answer": "The rationale for developing CSR initiatives is multifaceted and involves several factors. Here are the four options given and their rationales:\n\n(A) Corporations have responsibilities going beyond the production of their offerings at a profit. This is because corporations are part of the larger society and have a responsibility to contribute to the well-being of the society. They should not only focus on their bottom line but also consider the impact of their operations on the environment, the local community, and the society at large.\n\n(B) Corporations have a broader constituency of stakeholders than shareholders alone. This is because corporations are not just owned by shareholders but also have other stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, customers, and the community at large. These stakeholders also have a say in the operations of the corporation and should be taken into account when making decisions.\n\n(C) The impacts of corporations limit to only simple marketplace transactions. This is not a valid rationale for developing CSR initiatives. Corporations have a significant impact on the environment, the local community, and the society at large, and these impacts are not limited to simple marketplace transactions.\n\n(D) Corporations serve a wider range of human values, not captured solely by a focus on economic values. This is because corporations have a responsibility to serve the needs of the society and should consider the needs of various stakeholders beyond just shareholders. They should also consider the needs of the environment, the local community, and the society at large.\n\nTherefore, the rationale for developing CSR initiatives is not limited to any one of the given options.
