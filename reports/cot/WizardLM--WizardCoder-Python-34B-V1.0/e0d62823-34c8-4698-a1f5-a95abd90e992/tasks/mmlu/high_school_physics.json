            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nThe whiffle ball is tossed straight up, reaches a highest point, and falls back down. This means that the ball is experiencing both gravitational and aerodynamic forces. \r\n\r\nAerodynamic forces are responsible for slowing down the ball's upward motion and speeding up its downward motion. Gravitational forces are responsible for pulling the ball downward. \r\n\r\nAt the highest point, the ball's speed is zero because it has reached its maximum height and is now starting to fall back down. However, the ball's acceleration is not zero because it is still being pulled downward by gravitational forces. Therefore, statement I is true, but statement II is false. \r\n\r\nThe time it takes for the ball to travel up to the highest point and the time it takes to fall back down are both affected by the aerodynamic forces. Therefore, we cannot determine which time is longer without further information. Therefore, statement III is false. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) I & II only.",

We can do this by first finding the total volume of the water in the tank, which is given as the volume of the object plus the volume of the space above the water level. We can then subtract the volume of the object from this total volume to get the volume of the space above the water level. Finally, we can divide this volume by the volume of the object to get the percentage of the object's volume that is above the surface of the water.\n\nLet's start by finding the total volume of the water in the tank. We know that the volume of the object is 2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3, so the volume of the space above the water level is 2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3 minus the volume of the water that is already in the tank. Since the object floats, we know that the weight of the water above the object is equal to the weight of the object. Therefore, the volume of the water above the object is equal to the weight of the object divided by the density of water, which is 1000 kg/m^3. So the volume of the water above the object is 6 N / 1000 kg/m^3 = 6 \u00d7 10^-4 m^3.\n\nNow we can find the total volume of the water in the tank:\n\ntotal volume = volume of object + volume of water above object\n              = 2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3 + 6 \u00d7 10^-4 m^3\n              = 2.006 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3\n\nFinally, we can find the volume of the space above the water level:\n\nvolume above surface = total volume - volume of object\n                      = 2.006 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3 - 2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3\n                      = 6 \u00d7 10^-4 m^3\n\nAnd we can find the percentage of the object's volume that is above the surface of the water:\n\npercentage = volume above surface / volume of object\n           = 6 \u00d7 10^-4 m^3 / 2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3\n           = 30%\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 30%.",
