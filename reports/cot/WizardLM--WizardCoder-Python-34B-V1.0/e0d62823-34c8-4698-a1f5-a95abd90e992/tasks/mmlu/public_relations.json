            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Gregory (2006). \r\n\r\nReasoning: \r\n\r\nStrategy is a key concept in business management and is used to achieve competitive advantage for an organization. Strategy refers to the way an organization plans, organizes, and manages its resources to achieve its goals and objectives in a competitive environment. \r\n\r\nGregory (2006) emphasized the importance of strategy in his book \"Strategy: A Business Guide\". He defined strategy as \"a set of choices about how to create, capture, and deliver value to customers\". He further explained that strategy is about \"choosing what to do and how to do it better than your competitors\". Gregory emphasized the importance of strategy in business management and how it can help organizations to achieve competitive advantage. \r\n\r\nSteyn (2003) and Cutlip et al (2006) also wrote about strategy, but they did not emphasize its importance for achieving competitive advantage. Henry (2006) did not write about strategy at all. Therefore, Gregory (2006) is the correct answer.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The most effective form of communication in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue is (B) Media. \r\n\r\nReasoning:\r\n\r\nMedia has the ability to reach a large audience at once, allowing for a wide range of perspectives to be shared and discussed. This can help to form or change predispositions toward an issue because it allows for individuals to be exposed to different points of view and to form their own opinions based on the information they receive. Additionally, media can be used to present information in an engaging and informative way, making it more likely that individuals will absorb the information and be influenced by it. \r\n\r\nInterpersonal communication, on the other hand, is limited to the individuals directly involved in the conversation and can be more susceptible to biases and miscommunication. Group communication can also be effective in forming or changing predispositions, but it may be limited to the group and not reach as many people as media. Public communication can also be effective, but it may not be as targeted or tailored to the individual's needs and preferences as media.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Functional.\n\nEsman (1972) defines publics as \"social aggregates of individuals who share common interests, values, and attitudes\" (p. 10). He further explains that publics can be differentiated based on their level of organization and degree of cohesion.\n\nIn this context, \"functional publics\" are those that provide \"lending authority or assistance\" to an organization. These publics are characterized by their \"functional orientation\" and \"pragmatic\" approach to solving problems. They are typically \"well-organized\" and \"cohesive,\" with a \"strong sense of purpose\" and \"commitment to a common goal\" (p. 11).\n\nIn contrast, \"normative publics\" are those that \"exert pressure to conform to their standards and values\" (p. 11). They are characterized by their \"moral orientation\" and \"idealistic\" approach to solving problems. They are typically \"less well-organized\" and \"less cohesive,\" with a \"weaker sense of purpose\" and \"less commitment to a common goal\" (p. 11).\n\nFinally, \"diffused publics\" are those that \"provide little or no assistance\" to an organization. They are characterized by their \"individualistic\" approach to solving problems and lack of \"organizational cohesion\" (p. 11).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Functional, as this public provides the necessary authority and assistance to the organization.",

The Herm\u00e8s bag, known as the \"Kelly\", was designed in 1957 by the late French fashion designer Jean-Marcelle Kelly. Chanel claimed that the bag was a rip-off of its iconic \"2.55\" bag, which was designed in 1955 by Coco Chanel herself.

These objectives are the goals that the program is designed to achieve. The objectives are typically determined through a process of consultation with stakeholders, including program participants, funders, and other interested parties. \r\n\r\nOnce the objectives have been identified, the organization can then move on to the next stage of the planning process, which is developing a strategy to achieve those objectives. The strategy will outline the specific steps that the organization will take to achieve the objectives, and will typically include a set of measurable goals and milestones. \r\n\r\nOnce the strategy has been developed, the organization can move on to the implementation stage, where it takes action to put the strategy into practice. This may involve recruiting staff, securing funding, or launching a new program or service. \r\n\r\nFinally, the organization will evaluate the program to determine whether it has achieved its objectives. This may involve collecting data on program outcomes, gathering feedback from participants and other stakeholders, and analyzing the results to determine whether the program has been successful. \r\n\r\nIn summary, the objectives are decided on during the planning stage of the program, which involves consulting with stakeholders and identifying the goals that the program is designed to achieve.",
