            "model_answer": "The answer to this question is (B) 19,000\u201320,000. Here's the reasoning:\n\nThe question asks for the current estimate of the number of human protein-coding genes. Protein-coding genes are genes that encode proteins, which are essential for life. The number of human genes is estimated to be between 10,000 and 15,000, but this estimate may be reduced over time as more genes are discovered and classified.\n\nThe answer choices provide ranges of estimates for the number of human protein-coding genes. Choice (A) estimates between 10,000 and 15,000 genes, which is consistent with the initial estimate. Choice (B) estimates between 19,000 and 20,000 genes, which is a more precise estimate and reflects the current consensus among scientists. Choice (C) estimates between 29,000 and 30,000 genes, which is a much higher estimate and may be too optimistic given the current state of knowledge. Choice (D) estimates 100,000 genes, which is an even higher estimate and is not supported by current research.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 19,000\u201320,000.",

            "question": "The most common cystic fibrosis mutation consists of:\n\n(A) a deletion.\n(B) a duplication.\n(C) a substitution.\n(D) an insertion.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The most common cystic fibrosis mutation is a substitution. \r\n\r\nExplanation: \r\n\r\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disease caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene. The most common mutation is a substitution, which means that one base pair in the gene is replaced with another. This substitution causes the protein produced by the gene to not function properly, leading to the symptoms of cystic fibrosis. \r\n\r\nA deletion would mean that part of the gene is missing, which would cause the protein to be shorter than normal. A duplication would mean that part of the gene is repeated, which would cause the protein to be longer than normal. An insertion would mean that an extra base pair is added to the gene, which would cause the protein to be longer than normal. However, none of these mutations are as common as the substitution mutation.",

            "model_answer": "The risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria is almost 100%.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic metabolic disorder that affects the way the body breaks down phenylalanine, an amino acid found in certain foods. In PKU, the body cannot properly metabolize phenylalanine, which can lead to serious health problems in children, including mental retardation, seizures, and even death. \r\n\r\nIn the absence of treatment, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with PKU is high. This is because the fetus receives its nutrients through the placenta, which is formed during pregnancy. If the mother has PKU and does not receive proper treatment, the fetus will receive an excess of phenylalanine through the placenta, which can cause abnormalities in the developing brain and other organs. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU is almost 100%.",

This can be caused by a number of factors, including diet and genetics.\r\n\r\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia is a genetic condition where there is an excess of cholesterol in the blood due to a mutation in a gene. The gene in question encodes an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, which is responsible for converting cholesterol into a form that can be transported around the body.\r\n\r\nThe mutation in the gene causes the enzyme to malfunction, leading to an accumulation of cholesterol in the blood.

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) chromosome 21. \n\nExplanation:\n\nLeber's hereditary optic atrophy is a genetic disorder that causes progressive loss of vision. It is caused by a mutation in a gene that encodes a protein called rhodopsin. Rhodopsin is a light-sensitive protein that is located in the retina of the eye and is responsible for converting light into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. In Leber's hereditary optic atrophy, the rhodopsin protein is defective and does not function properly, leading to the progressive loss of vision.\n\nThe mutation that causes Leber's hereditary optic atrophy is located on chromosome 21, which is the largest human chromosome. The mutation is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that both parents must carry the mutation for their child to be affected.\n\nMitochondrial DNA is not involved in the inheritance of Leber's hereditary optic atrophy. Mitochondrial DNA is passed on from the mother to the child during fertilization, but it does not contain genes that are responsible for the functioning of the eye.",

            "model_answer": "An increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, is likely to result in:\r\n\r\n(A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nInbreeding, also known as consanguinity, occurs when individuals are related by blood or marriage. Inbreeding can lead to a reduction in genetic variation within a population, which can be detrimental to the health and fitness of individuals. Increased inbreeding can lead to an increased frequency of homozygous genes, which can reduce the likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population. Heterozygotes are genetically diverse and can contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation within a population.\r\n\r\n(B) higher proportion of genes that show linkage\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nLinkage is the tendency of two or more genes to be inherited together, usually on the same chromosome. Increased inbreeding can lead to an increased frequency of homozygous genes, which can increase the likelihood of linkage. Homozygous genes are more likely to be inherited together on the same chromosome, leading to an increased frequency of linkage.\r\n\r\n(C) higher proportion of genes with introns\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nIntrons are regions of DNA that are not translated into protein. Increased inbreeding can lead to an increased frequency of homozygous genes, which can increase the likelihood of introns. Homozygous genes are more likely to be inherited together on the same chromosome, leading to an increased frequency of introns.\r\n\r\n(D) higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nIncreased inbreeding can lead to an increased frequency of homozygous genes, which can increase the likelihood of genetic drift. Genetic drift occurs when a small change in the frequency of a gene occurs over time due to random genetic fluctuations. Increased genetic drift can lead to a higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells, as genetic drift can lead to changes in the expression of genes.",

The mutation causes a reduction in the production of haemoglobin, which results in a decrease in oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood. The most common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia is a point mutation, which means that a single nucleotide in the gene is changed, resulting in a different amino acid being encoded.
