The other options do not directly address the issue of non-normality, but may be useful in other contexts.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Option (A) suggests using a logarithmic functional form instead of a linear one. This may be useful if the data exhibit heteroscedasticity, as it can help to equalize the variances of the residuals. However, it does not address the issue of non-normality directly.\n\n2. Option (B) suggests adding lags of the variables on the right hand side of the regression model. This can help to account for autocorrelation in the residuals, which can cause them to deviate from normality. However, it does not address the issue of non-normality directly.\n\n3. Option (C) suggests estimating the model in first differenced form. This can help to address the issue of non-normality in the residuals, as it can remove any trend or seasonality in the data that may be causing the non-normality. First differencing can help to make the residuals more normally distributed.\n\n4. Option (D) suggests removing any large outliers from the data. This can help to improve the normality of the residuals, as large outliers can cause the residuals to deviate from normality.

            "model_answer": "The correct statement is (D).\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n(A) Mean squared error is usually highly correlated with trading rule profitability: This statement is true as mean squared error is a common measure of forecast accuracy and is often used to evaluate the performance of trading strategies. However, it is important to note that mean squared error alone cannot determine the profitability of a trading strategy, as other factors such as transaction costs and market conditions also play a role.\r\n\r\n(B) Mean absolute error provides a quadratic loss function: This statement is false. Mean absolute error is a measure of forecast accuracy that is calculated by taking the absolute value of the difference between the actual value and the forecasted value. It is not a loss function and does not have a specific shape like a quadratic function.\r\n\r\n(C) Mean absolute percentage error is a useful measure for evaluating asset return forecasts: This statement is true. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is a measure of forecast accuracy that is calculated by taking the absolute value of the percentage difference between the actual value and the forecasted value. It is often used to evaluate the performance of asset return forecasts, as it provides a better measure of accuracy than mean absolute error when dealing with percentages.\r\n\r\n(D) Mean squared error penalises large forecast errors disproportionately more than small forecast errors: This statement is true. Mean squared error is calculated by squaring the difference between the actual value and the forecasted value, which means that large forecast errors are penalised more than small forecast errors. This makes mean squared error a useful measure for evaluating forecast accuracy, as it encourages the minimisation of large errors while still allowing for some small errors.",

It assumes that the variance of the process is a function of the past squared returns and the past variance. The model can capture several features of financial asset return time-series, including:\r\n\r\ni) Fat tails in the return distribution: GARCH models can capture the presence of fat tails in the return distribution by allowing for the variance to increase over time, leading to larger positive or negative returns. This is because the variance is assumed to be a function of past squared returns, which can be large for rare extreme events.\r\n\r\nii) Leverage effects: GARCH models can capture leverage effects by allowing for the conditional variance to increase when the absolute value of the returns is large. This is because the variance is assumed to be a function of past squared returns, which can be large for large absolute returns.\r\n\r\niii) Volatility clustering: GARCH models can capture volatility clustering by allowing for the conditional variance to change rapidly over time, leading to periods of high and low volatility. This is because the variance is assumed to be a function of past squared returns and past variance, which can lead to sudden changes in the variance.\r\n\r\niv) Volatility affecting returns: GARCH models can capture the effect of volatility on returns by allowing for the conditional mean to be a function of past returns and past conditional variance.
