            "question": "International trade will almost always benefit both countries, so why do countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market?\n\n(A) Irrationality on the part of the leadership\n(B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed\n(C) Regime type\n(D) International conflict prevents trade",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed.\n\nExplanation:\n\nCountries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market for various reasons, but the main reason is to avoid the potential costs of international trade. \n\nFree trade, by definition, involves the removal of barriers to international trade, such as tariffs and quotas. While free trade can bring many benefits, such as increased economic growth, job creation, and increased international competitiveness, it can also have costs. These costs can be concentrated on a few firms in a particular industry, while the benefits are more widely dispersed.\n\nFor example, when a country lowers its tariffs on imported goods, the domestic firms in that industry may face increased competition from foreign firms. This can lead to job losses, reduced profitability, and investment inefficiently being allocated to less productive firms.\n\nOn the other hand, consumers can benefit from lower prices and increased choice, while the country as a whole can benefit from increased economic growth and international competitiveness.\n\nTherefore, while free trade can benefit both countries, governments often choose to protect their own firms from the potential costs of international trade.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The main argument of Paul Kennedy's book The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers is that great powers rise and fall due to internal and external factors. He argues that the rise of a great power is often followed by a period of decline, and that the factors that led to the rise of a great power can also lead to its decline. He also argues that the factors that led to the decline of a great power can also lead to its rise. He concludes that the only constant in the history of great powers is change, and that the rise and fall of great powers is inevitable.",

            "question": "How did World War I shift economic power from Europe to the United States?\n\n(A) The war reduced European population levels below that of the United States\n(B) The United States seized German resources after the war\n(C) European countries paid the United States for assistance\n(D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D). \n\nExplanation:\n\nWorld War I was a global conflict that involved most of the world's great powers. The war was fought between 1914 and 1918, and it led to the defeat of the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) and the Allied Powers (France, Britain, Russia, Japan, and Italy).\n\nThe war caused significant damage and loss of life on both sides. However, it also had a significant impact on the global economy. The war led to the destruction of European industries and infrastructure, which in turn led to a decline in European economic output.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States remained relatively unaffected by the war. The US was not involved in the conflict, and its economy was not significantly impacted by the war. In fact, the US economy grew significantly during the war, as it benefited from increased demand for its goods and services.\n\nAfter the war, the United States emerged as the dominant economic power in the world. This was primarily due to the increased demand for US goods and services, as well as the large amount of war reparations paid by the defeated Central Powers to the Allied Powers, including the United States.\n\nThe United States also emerged as a creditor country, as it lent money to the Allied Powers during the war. This led to a large amount of money flowing into the US economy, which further boosted its economic output.\n\nIn conclusion, the war shifted economic power from Europe to the United States because the US was not significantly affected by the war, while Europe suffered significant economic damage. The US emerged as the dominant economic power in the world after the war, primarily due to the increased demand for its goods and services and the large amount of war reparations paid by the defeated Central Powers to the Allied Powers, including the United States.",

It was the first treaty to limit the number of strategic nuclear weapons that each country could possess. The treaty was signed during the Cold War and was intended to reduce tensions between the two superpowers.\n\nThe treaty required both countries to reduce their strategic offensive nuclear forces by 50%. This meant that the United States and the Soviet Union had to destroy or dismantle a significant number of their nuclear weapons. The treaty also included provisions for inspections and verification to ensure that both countries were complying with the treaty.\n\nThe treaty was renewed several times, with the final version coming into effect in 2011.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "American exceptionalism is the idea that the United States is unique and special, and that it has a special role in the world. This idea has been a source of national pride and has led to a strong sense of national identity in the United States.\n\nHowever, this idea can also lead to opposition to world government. Here are three reasons why American exceptionalism might lead to opposition to world government:\n\n1. Its general anti-statism opposes centralized government: American exceptionalism is often associated with a strong distrust of centralized government, and this distrust can extend to world government. Many Americans believe that world government would infringe on their individual freedoms and undermine the American way of life.\n\n2. It views world government as impractical: American exceptionalism often emphasizes the importance of individualism and self-reliance, and this can lead to a distrust of international institutions and organizations. Many Americans believe that world government is too complex and unwieldy to effectively govern the world, and that it would be better to rely on individual countries to solve their own problems.\n\n3. It views the UN as a sufficient form of global governance: The United Nations is often seen as a symbol of American exceptionalism, and this can lead to opposition to more ambitious forms of global governance. Many Americans believe that the UN is already too powerful and that it should not be given more authority.\n\nIn conclusion, American exceptionalism can lead to opposition to world government because it is often associated with a distrust of centralized government, a distrust of international institutions, and a belief that the UN is already too powerful.",
