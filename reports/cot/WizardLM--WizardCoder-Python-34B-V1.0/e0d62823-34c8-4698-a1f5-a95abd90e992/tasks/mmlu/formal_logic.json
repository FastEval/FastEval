We can do this using indirect truth tables.\n\nFirst, let's create a truth table for the premises:\n\nH | I | J | K | ~J | (I \u00b7 ~J) | H \u2261 (I \u00b7 ~J) | K \u2261 ~H\n-------------\nT | T | T | F | F | F | T | F\nT | T | F | T | T | T | T | T\nT | F | T | F | F | F | T | F\nT | F | F | T | T | T | T | T\nF | T | T | F | F | F | F | F\nF | T | F | T | T | T | F | F\nF | F | T | F | F | F | F | F\nF | F | F | T | T | T | F | F\n\nNow, let's create a truth table for the conclusion:\n\nI | J | ~(K \u2283 J) | I \u2261 J | ~(K \u2283 J) / I \u2261 J\n-------------\nT | T | T | T | T\nT | F | T | F | T\nF | T | T | F | T\nF | F | T | T | T\n\nNow, let's compare the two truth tables.

We can do this by setting the values of H, K, I, J, and ~J to the same values in both tables.\n\nFor example, let's consider the case when H, K, I, J, and ~J are all true. In the premises table, this corresponds to the first row, where H, K, I, J, and ~J are all true, and H \u2261 (I \u00b7 ~J) and K \u2261 ~H are both true. In the conclusion table, this corresponds to the first row, where I, J, and I \u2261 J are all true, and ~(K \u2283 J) / I \u2261 J is also true.\n\nSimilarly, we can check the other cases where H, K, I, J, and ~J have the same values in both tables.

            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nThe given statement is \"Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian.\" We need to translate this into predicate logic. \r\n\r\nFirst, let's identify the predicates and their arguments. The predicate here is \"being Egyptian\" and its argument is the person's name. So, we can represent this predicate as E(x), where x is the person's name. \r\n\r\nNow, let's look at the statement. It says that Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian. This means that both Abdul and Cleopatra satisfy the predicate E(x). \r\n\r\nSo, we can represent the given statement in predicate logic as:\r\n\r\nE(Abdul) \u2227 E(Cleopatra)\r\n\r\nNow, let's compare this with the options given:\r\n\r\n(A) Ea \u2022 Ec: This option says that there exists a person x such that if x is Abdul, then x is Egyptian, and if x is Cleopatra, then x is Egyptian. This is not the same as saying that both Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian. \r\n\r\n(B) Ea \u2022 c: This option says that there exists a person x such that if x is Abdul, then x is Egyptian, and x is Cleopatra. This is not the same as saying that both Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian. \r\n\r\n(C) Ae \u2228 Ce: This option says that either Abdul is Egyptian or Cleopatra is Egyptian, but not both. This is not the same as saying that both Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian. \r\n\r\n(D) Ex \u2022 Ey: This option says that there exists a person x such that if x is Abdul, then x is Egyptian, and there exists a person y such that if y is Cleopatra, then y is Egyptian. This is not the same as saying that both Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct option is (A).",
