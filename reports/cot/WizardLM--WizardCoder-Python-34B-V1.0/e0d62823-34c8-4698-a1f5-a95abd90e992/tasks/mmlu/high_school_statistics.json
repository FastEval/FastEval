The mode, standard deviation, and median are all useful measures of statistical dispersion, but they are not as relevant to the salary negotiation process as the mean. The mode is the most frequently occurring salary, which may not be indicative of the overall average salary. The standard deviation measures the degree of dispersion of salaries around the mean, but it does not directly provide information about the average salary. The median is a more robust measure of central tendency than the mean, but it is still not as relevant as the mean in this context.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to use the normal distribution. We are given the mean daily demand for bread, which is 2,500 loaves, and the standard deviation, which is 225 loaves. We are also given that the bakery bakes 3,000 loaves every morning.\n\nWe need to calculate the probability that the bakery will run out of bread today. This means that the number of loaves baked in the morning (3,000) is less than the mean daily demand for bread (2,500) plus the standard deviation (225).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the z-score. The z-score is the number of standard deviations below or above the mean. In this case, we want to know how many standard deviations below the mean 3,000 is from 2,500. We can use the formula:\n\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere x is the observed value, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, x is 3,000, \u03bc is 2,500, and \u03c3 is 225.\n\nz = (3,000 - 2,500) / 225\nz = 25 / 225\nz = 0.11\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can use a z-table to find the probability. A z-table is a chart that shows the area under the standard normal curve for various z-scores. We want to find the probability that the area under the curve to the left of the z-score is less than or equal to 0.11.\n\nUsing a z-table, we find that the probability is approximately 0.9082. This means that there is a 90.82% chance that the bakery will have enough bread to meet the demand. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) 0.9082",

            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nA discrete probability distribution is a type of probability distribution where the possible values of the random variable X are discrete (i.e., countable). For example, if we are rolling a die, the possible values of X are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. In contrast, a continuous probability distribution is a type of probability distribution where the possible values of the random variable X are continuous (i.e., uncountable). For example, if we are measuring the temperature in a room, the possible values of X are any real number between -infinity and +infinity.\r\n\r\nNow, let's consider each option:\r\n\r\n(A) The expected value of X = np. This is true for any discrete probability distribution. The expected value of a discrete random variable is the weighted sum of its possible values, where the weights are the probabilities of each value. In other words, if X can take on values x1, x2, ..., xn, and the probabilities of each value are p1, p2, ..., pn, then the expected value of X is:\r\n\r\nE[X] = p1*x1 + p2*x2 + ... + pn*xn\r\n\r\n(B) The sum of all possible values of X is equal to one. This is not true in general. For example, if X can take on values 1, 2, 3, and the probabilities of each value are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, respectively, then the sum of all possible values of X is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is not equal to one.\r\n\r\n(C) The probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one. This is true for any discrete probability distribution. By definition, a probability distribution is a function that assigns probabilities to all possible outcomes of a random experiment. Since the probabilities must be non-negative and sum to one, it follows that the sum of all possible values of X must be one.\r\n\r\n(D) The probability distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric. This is not true in general. For example, if X can take on values 1, 2, 3, and the probabilities of each value are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, respectively, then the probability distribution is not bell-shaped or symmetric.
