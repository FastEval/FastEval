            "model_answer": "The angular separation of two stars refers to the angle between the two stars as seen from the Earth. The angular resolution of the eyes refers to the smallest angle that the eye can distinguish between two objects.\n\nIf the angular separation of two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of the eyes, it means that the two stars will appear as a single point of light to the naked eye. This is because the eye is unable to distinguish between the two stars, and they appear as a single point of light.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C). Earth has the strongest magnetic field among the terrestrial worlds because it is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation. This is because a magnetic field is generated by a moving electric current, which is created by the flow of molten iron in the core. The faster the rotation, the stronger the magnetic field. Additionally, the magnetic field is enhanced by the presence of a thick layer of iron-rich molten rock in the core, which acts as a giant magnet. Other terrestrial worlds, such as Venus and Mars, do not have a magnetic field because they do not have a molten core or a thick layer of iron-rich molten rock.",

Additionally, Saturn has a significant \"shear\" between bands of circulation at different latitudes, while Jupiter does not have significant shear.

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D). \n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen the solar nebula formed a disk, materials naturally segregated into bands. In our particular solar system, the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part. This is because the inner planets are closer to the Sun and the Sun's gravitational pull is stronger, causing the denser materials to settle closer to the Sun. The outer planets are farther from the Sun and have a weaker gravitational pull, causing the lighter materials to settle farther from the Sun.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (D). \r\n\r\nPtolemy's model of the universe was based on the idea that the planets orbit Earth on 'circles upon circles'. This meant that each planet had a fixed distance from Earth, and that they moved around Earth in a circular motion. \r\n\r\nThe reason for this model was to properly account for the varying distances of the planets from Earth. Ptolemy's model was based on the observations of ancient Greek astronomers, who had noticed that the planets moved at different speeds and in different directions. Ptolemy's model explained this by assuming that the planets were at different distances from Earth, and that they moved around Earth in circular orbits. \r\n\r\nBy assuming that the planets were at different distances from Earth, Ptolemy's model was able to explain why more distant planets took longer to make a circuit through the constellations of the zodiac. It also explained why the planets sometimes appeared to move westward rather than eastward relative to the stars in our sky, since the planets would appear to move faster when they were closer to Earth.",
