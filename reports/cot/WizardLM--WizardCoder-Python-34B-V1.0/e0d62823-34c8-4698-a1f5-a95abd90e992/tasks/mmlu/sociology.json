            "model_answer": "To determine the letter that corresponds to the statement made by Brown & Harris (1978), we need to consider the options given and identify which one is most likely to be true based on the available evidence. \r\n\r\nFirst, let's consider option (A). According to this option, women's susceptibility to stress depends on their levels of social support. This is a reasonable statement, as social support has been shown to be beneficial in reducing stress and its negative effects on mental health. However, it is important to note that this option does not provide any information about the susceptibility of men to stress or their levels of social support. Therefore, it is not the most complete explanation of the findings of Brown & Harris (1978).\r\n\r\nNext, let's consider option (B). According to this option, self-reported depression is highest amongst men and the relatively affluent. This statement suggests that men are more likely to experience depression than women, and that this is particularly true for men who are relatively affluent. However, it is important to note that this option does not provide any information about the susceptibility of women to stress or their levels of social support. Additionally, it does not address the question of whether men and women have similar levels of diagnosed depression, which is an important aspect of the findings of Brown & Harris (1978).\r\n\r\nOption (C) suggests that men and women have fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression. This is a reasonable statement, as it has been shown that men and women experience depression at similar rates. However, it does not address the question of whether women's susceptibility to stress depends on their levels of social support, which is an important aspect of the findings of Brown & Harris (1978).\r\n\r\nFinally, let's consider option (D). According to this option, men are more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles. This statement suggests that men may be more likely to experience depression because of societal expectations that men should be strong and independent, while women are expected to be nurturing and caring. However, it is important to note that this option does not provide any information about the susceptibility of women to stress or their levels of social support. Additionally, it does not address the question of whether men and women have similar levels of diagnosed depression, which is an important aspect of the findings of Brown & Harris (1978).\r\n\r\nBased on the available evidence, the most complete explanation of the findings of Brown & Harris (1978) is that both men and women are susceptible to depression, but women's susceptibility depends on their levels of social support. Therefore, the correct letter is (A).",

They are formed when people from the same ethnic background live in close proximity to each other, and often have similar interests and values. \r\n\r\nB) Gay villages are also a new form of community that are formed in certain parts of large cities. They are communities where gay men and lesbians live together, often in close proximity to each other. \r\n\r\nC) Sociological communities are not a new form of community. They are communities that are formed by people who share similar interests and values, but they are not based on any specific identity or experience. \r\n\r\nD) Virtual communities are also a new form of community that exist only in cyberspace. They are formed when people with similar interests and values meet online and interact with each other through various online platforms.",

This is because the thesis is based on the idea that the working class is becoming more like the middle class, and one way this can happen is through the use of technology to automate and simplify tasks that were once done by skilled workers. This leads to a reduction in the need for skilled labor, and an increase in the number of unskilled or semi-skilled workers. This in turn leads to a shift in the balance of power between capital and labor, with capital gaining more power and control over labor.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D). \n\nSullivan's (2000) study found that men who were unemployed or had both partners working full-time were more likely to do housework. This is because they had less time to spend at work and more time to spend at home. Additionally, men who were unemployed or had both partners working full-time were more likely to have wives who nagged them to do more housework. This is because wives often feel more resentful when their husbands are not around to help with household chores. \n\nOn the other hand, men who rediscovered themselves as 'new men' or had exciting gadgets like the hoover and electric iron were not necessarily more likely to do housework. This is because these factors do not necessarily increase the amount of time men have to spend at home or reduce their resentment towards their wives' nagging.",

Additionally, observing people in a non-natural setting can lead to misinterpretation of their behavior and actions, which can affect the validity of the data collected.

Here are the reasons why each of the given options should be avoided:\n\n1. Fixed-choice questions: These questions present the respondent with a set of pre-defined answers, which may limit their ability to provide an honest response. For example, if a question asks \"What is your favorite color? (A) Red, (B) Blue, (C) Green\", the respondent may feel pressured to choose one of the given options, even if their favorite color is not one of them.\n\n2. Short questions: These questions may not provide enough context for the respondent to provide a meaningful answer. For example, if a question asks \"Do you like pizza? (Y/N)\", the respondent may not have enough information to make an informed decision.\n\n3. Leading questions: These questions ask the respondent to agree or disagree with a particular statement, which may influence their answer. For example, if a question asks \"Would you say that climate change is a serious problem? (Y/N)\", the respondent may feel pressured to agree with the statement, even if they have doubts.\n\n4. Funnelled questions: These questions limit the respondent's ability to provide a diverse range of answers. For example, if a question asks \"What is your favorite brand of soda? (A) Coca-Cola, (B) Pepsi, (C) Dr. Pepper\", the respondent may feel pressured to choose one of the given options, even if their favorite brand is not one of them.\n\nIn conclusion, all of the given options should be avoided in order to create an unbiased survey that provides accurate and meaningful results. The final answer is (A), (B), (C), and (D).",
