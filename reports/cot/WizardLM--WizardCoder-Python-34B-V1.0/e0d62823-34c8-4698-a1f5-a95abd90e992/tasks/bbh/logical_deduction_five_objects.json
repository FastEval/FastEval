We also know that Rob finished above Mya, which means that Rob cannot be the golfer who finished second-to-last either, as he would have finished in a position higher than Mya. This leaves us with three possible candidates: Eli, Joe, and Mya.\n\nNext, we consider the information that Joe finished above Eli. This means that Joe must have finished in a position higher than Eli. Since Joe cannot be the golfer who finished first (as we already established), he must have finished in a position lower than Mya. This leaves us with two possible candidates: Eli and Mya.\n\nFinally, we consider the information that Joe finished below Mya. This means that Mya must have finished in a position higher than Joe. Since Mya cannot be the golfer who finished first (as we already established), she must have finished in a position lower than Eve.
