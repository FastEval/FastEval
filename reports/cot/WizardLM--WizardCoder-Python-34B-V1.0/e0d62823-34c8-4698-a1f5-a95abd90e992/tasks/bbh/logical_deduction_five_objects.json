This leaves us with three possible candidates: Eli, Joe, and Mya.\n\nNext, we consider the information that Joe finished above Eli. This means that Joe must have finished in a position higher than Eli. Since Joe cannot be the golfer who finished first (as we already established), he must have finished in a position lower than Mya.
