The pears are more expensive than the watermelons.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) The oranges are the cheapest\n\nIf the oranges are the cheapest, then the pears must be more expensive than the oranges, and the watermelons must be the most expensive. However, we are given that the pears are more expensive than the watermelons, which contradicts this option. Therefore, the oranges cannot be the cheapest.\n\n(B) The watermelons are the cheapest\n\nIf the watermelons are the cheapest, then the pears must be more expensive than the watermelons, and the oranges must be more expensive than the pears. However, we are given that the oranges are the second-most expensive, which contradicts this option. Therefore, the watermelons cannot be the cheapest.\n\n(C) The pears are the cheapest\n\nIf the pears are the cheapest, then the watermelons must be more expensive than the pears, and the oranges must be more expensive than the watermelons. However, we are given that the oranges are the second-most expensive, which contradicts this option. Therefore, the pears cannot be the cheapest.\n\nBased on the given information and the analysis of the options, we can conclude that none of the options is correct. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) None of the above.",

This means that Mel finished below Ana, which is a contradiction since we were told that Mel finished below Ana.\n\nTherefore, Ada must be in position 2. This means that Mel is in position 1, and Ana is in position 3.\n\nNow, since Mel finished below Ana, we know that Mel must be in either position 1 or 2.\n\nIf Mel is in position 1, then Ada must be in position 2, and Ana must be in position 3. This means that Ada finished above Ana, which is a contradiction since we were told that Ada finished above Ana.\n\nTherefore, Mel must be in position 2.
