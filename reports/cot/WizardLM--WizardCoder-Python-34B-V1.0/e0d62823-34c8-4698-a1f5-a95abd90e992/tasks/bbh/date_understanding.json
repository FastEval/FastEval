            "correct_answer": "(E)",
            "model_answer": "First, we need to determine the current year. Since the question states that May 6, 1992 is like yesterday to Jane, we can assume that Jane is currently in her mid-thirties or forties. Therefore, the current year is likely to be between 2015 and 2020.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the difference between the current year and 1992. 1992 is a leap year, so there are 366 days between May 6, 1992 and December 31, 1992. The current year is also a leap year, so there are 366 days between January 1 and December 31 in the current year. Therefore, there are 366 + (current year - 1992 - 1) * 365 days between May 6, 1992 and the current year.\n\nTo find the date today in MM/DD/YYYY format, we need to calculate the number of days between May 6, 1992 and today. We can use the following formula:\n\n(current year - 1992 - 1) * 365 + (current year - 1992 - 1) // 4 + (current year - 1992 - 1) // 100 - (current year - 1992 - 1) // 400 + 126\n\nwhere // represents integer division.\n\nPlugging in the current year as 2020, we get:\n\n(2020 - 1992 - 1) * 365 + (2020 - 1992 - 1) // 4 + (2020 - 1992 - 1) // 100 - (2020 - 1992 - 1) // 400 + 126\n= 7305 + 197 + 20 - 5 + 126\n= 7528\n\nTherefore, the number of days between May 6, 1992 and today is 7528.\n\nTo convert this to a date in MM/DD/YYYY format, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Divide 7528 by 365. The quotient is the number of whole years passed, and the remainder is the number of days in the current year.\n2. Subtract the number of days in the current year from 365.\n3. Divide the remaining number of days by 30. The quotient is the number of whole months passed, and the remainder is the number of days in the current month.\n4. If the current month is February, and the current year is a leap year, and the remaining number of days is greater than 29, subtract 1 from the remaining number of days.\n5. If the current month has 31 days and the remaining number of days is greater than 31, subtract 31 from the remaining number of days and add 1 to the month.\n6. If the current month has 30 days and the remaining number of days is greater than 30, subtract 30 from the remaining number of days and add 1 to the month.\n7. The remaining number of days is the current day of the month.\n\nUsing this algorithm, we get:\n\n1. 7528 // 365 = 2 (whole years passed)\n2. 7528 % 365 = 126 (remaining number of days)\n3. 126 // 30 = 4 (whole months passed)\n4. February is a leap year, so we don't need to subtract 1 from the remaining number of days.\n5. The current month is April, which has 30 days.\n6. 126 % 30 = 6 (remaining number of days)\n7. The current day of the month is 6.\n\nTherefore, the date today in MM/DD/YYYY format is 04/06/2020.",
