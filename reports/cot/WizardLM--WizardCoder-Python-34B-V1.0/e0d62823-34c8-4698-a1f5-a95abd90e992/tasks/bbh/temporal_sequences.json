            "correct_answer": "(A)",
            "model_answer": "To determine between what times William could have gone to the coffee shop, we need to consider when the coffee shop was open and when William could have left his other activities to go to the coffee shop.\n\nThe coffee shop was closed after 10pm, so we can eliminate option (D) since William would not have been able to leave his other activity (waiting at the airport) to go to the coffee shop after 10pm.\n\nNext, we need to consider when William could have left his other activities to go to the coffee shop.\n\nWilliam could not have left the library before 9am, since he was reading there until 9am. Therefore, options (A) and (B) are eliminated.\n\nWilliam could not have left the airport before 3pm, since he was waiting there until 3pm. Therefore, option (C) is eliminated.\n\nThis leaves us with option (B) as the correct answer.",
