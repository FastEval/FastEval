            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "I think that (C) it explains the nature of power-conferring rules best captures the purpose of Hart's distinction between being obliged and having an obligation. \n\nA power-conferring rule is a rule that imposes a obligation on someone by providing them with the means to enforce it. For example, if a person is driving on the wrong side of the road and is pulled over by the police, that person is under an obligation to pull over immediately and correctly identify themselves. Hart's distinction between being obliged and having an obligation best captures the difference between the two different types of rules and the two different ways they can impose an obligation. \n\nTo best further explain this, it might be helpful to consider the difference between a 1969 Ford Mustang and a Lamborghini Urus. While both cars are fast and enjoyable to drive, one is much more powerful and capable of doing more damage to the environment if driven irresponsibly. While one can be legally obliged to drive the other, it would be more difficult to impose an obligation on someone to drive the Urus responsibly if they did not have the means to do so. In other words, the ability to enforce the rules makes a difference in whether someone is being obliged to follow them or having an obligation to do so. In the case of a car, this means that a Lamborghini Urus owner would likely be considered to have an obligation to drive responsibly, while a 1969 Ford Mustang owner would likely only be considered to be obliged to drive responsibly.",

            "model_answer": "First, let us reflect on the text given:\n\n\"Do not output the answer immediately. Instead first explain your reasoning step-by-step. Only afterwards output the answer.\"\nThe answer in now visible:\n \"T-The answer can only be T. TI may be challenging to answer with any certainty and cannot be confirmed by the text given.\"\n\nNext, we can analyze the given criticism's:\n\n(A) There is no distinction between the two forms of legal reasoning. \n\n This criticism suggests that there is no distinction between the two forms of legal reasoning. In fact, Llewellyn's distinction between the grand and formal styles of legal reasoning suggests that there is a clear distinction between the two forms. It is based on the level of abstraction, the logic used and the type of argumentative structure used. While it can be that a judge may lean one way or another on specific situations these differences are smaller than what Llewellyn describes. \n\nThis criticism thus seems incorrect.\n\n\n(B) Judges are appointed to interpret the law, not to make it.\n\n\n This criticism suggests that judges should not be pigeon holed in this way. In fact, Llewellyn's distinction between the grand and formal styles of legal reasoning is for the most part based on the type of legal institution a judge is appointed to. Appointed to the supreme court they may be bound to follow its precedent. Appointed to the supreme court, their job is to interpret law not make it. Appointed to the local courts they may be tasked with interpreting judge made law (in Llewellyn'sOUT) and may challenge it only to avoid breaking the law. In no way should this pigeon holing be considered as fell from the sky and don't reflect the true nature of the law.\n\nThis criticism thus seems incorrect.\n\n\n(C) It is misleading to pigeon-hole judges in this way.\n\n\n This criticism suggests that the pigeon holing described in the text is \"misleading\" because it is not applicable to all judges. This is true as well, and it would be Bad manners to be unkind to a person taking time from their busy schedule to educate you as such. While they may be somewhat applicable it is not very relevant to them.\n\nThis criticism thus seems incorrect.\n\n\n(D) Judicial reasoning is always formal.\n\n\n This criticism suggests that judges reason in a formal way. This is not incorrect, but your description of judicial reasoning is clearly too narrow. Decision making takes into account many aspects, but formal reasoning is how progress is made in the law when there are few precedents and the many aspects of a situation call for a holistic solution difficult to discern. This kind of ruling is a formal reasoning from precedent and law to answer a question whose manner is not clear.\n\n\n(E) The critical description is flawed.\n\n\n Suggesting a flaw does not mean the criticism is itself invalid. This criticism does not explain the cause of Llewellyn's criticism or how it isn't valid. Instead it is pointing out a problem.  Shouldnear decisions be ignored? Have no precedents? The law should cover all aspects of possible situations be Llewellyn's outline is faulty. \n\nThis criticism thus seems incorrect.\n\nNow that we have gone through the descriptions, let us summarize the assessment\n\nIn this case the most compelling criticism is.(T) As it stands now, the answer is T",

To choose, for example, a system that protects the wealthiest people as the most compassionate is a system which most people would not choose if they knew they would be born into it. So, as a member of the polysentient post pituitary Oregonian (POP) species, the most consistent choice would be to choose principles that protect the most unselfish members of society.
