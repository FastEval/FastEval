The White House, in turn, requests a formal statement from the North Vietnamese government explaining the motivations behind the attacks.\n\nOn August 6, 1964, the North Vietnamese government issues a statement denying the attacks and acknowledging that any acts of aggression were committed by South Vietnamese fighter pilots in response to South Vietnamese government planes attacking North Vietnam.\n\nThe White House, in its report, claims that the North Vietnamese attack caused a \"Clear and present danger to American interests and to civilised order in the world\" and thus justifies military intervention in Vietnam.\n\na.) There were no new attacks in the Gulf of Tonkin, so the draft resolution had to modify something else. Philippines\nb.) A majority of opinion was against involvement in Vietnam. USA\nProjections of where troops were sent was modified; Kennedy administration saw strong public opposition to their plans.\n\nc.) No significant public opinion opposed the US taking part in Vietnam. From the previously expressed reasons, it sounds like a given. C\nd.)
