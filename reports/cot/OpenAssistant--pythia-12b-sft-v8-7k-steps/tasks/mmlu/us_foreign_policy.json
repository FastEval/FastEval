            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) 5 permanent members with veto power, 10 rotating members with no veto power\n\nMy reasoning step-by-step:\n\nTo begin with, we can identify the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council as the five nation-states that have been in existence since the founding of the organization: China, France, Russia, theUnited Kingdom, and the United States. These five countries have exercised a permanent seat on the Security Council and are recognized as the main decision-makers within the body.\n\nThe rotating members of the Security Council, also known as the P5, are elected on an annual basis and serve one-year terms. The remaining ten members, known as the non-permanent members, rotate on a yearly basis and are elected for a term of two years. Together, the permanent and non-permanent members make up the full Security Council.\n\nNow, let us consider the veto power, which is a key aspect of the Security Council's structure. In its current form, the Security Council possesses a five-veto power structure, with each of the five permanent members of the body having the ability to block any resolution passed by the Security Council. This means that any decision made by the Security Council must be unanimous, with no single permanent member able to block it.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure of the United Nations Security Council is (A) 5 permanent members with veto power, 10 rotating members with no veto power.\n\nPlease note that my statement refers to current structure rather than it could change in the future.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Richard Nixon was the first American president to visit communist China.\n\nThis is because Richard Nixon was the first American president to travel to China in 1972. His trip was documented in the book \"The 136 Days: A Water Passage to History,\" which was later adapted into a TV miniseries. According to the book, Nixon was the first president to fly on a Boeing 747 SR-71, which was the jet that flew his team to China. Therefore, Richard Nixon was the first American president to visit Communist China.",
