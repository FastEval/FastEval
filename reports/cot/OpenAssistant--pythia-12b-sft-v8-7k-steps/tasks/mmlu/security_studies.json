            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Okay, let me go through this step by step:\n\n(A) The responsibility to prevent - This principle emphasizes the duty of holding individuals and institutions accountable for their actions and protecting them from harm themselves. While this is important in many contexts, it is not exactly what the responsibility to protect refers to. It mentions neither prevention nor accountability.\n\n(B) The responsibility to react - This refers to the duty to intervene when there is an emergency to prevent or stop human suffering. It implies a level of response but not necessarily prevention. Ironically, this may be the closest to being in line with the responsibility to protect in the sense that it implies action to relieve suffering. However, it is not quite correct either.\n\n(C) The responsibility to remain sovereign - This is a principle expressed by the International Criminal Court and emphasizes the responsibility to maintain international law and order. While this is important, it is not a direct opposed to the responsibility to protect in any way. There is nothing inherently opposed, but it is redundant. It could be considered a subset, though nothing more.\n\n(D) The responsibility to rebuild - This refers to the idea of helping countries recover from natural disasters, war, and other crises. While it is a more tangible response, it is not directly opposed to the responsibility to protect. However, it could be seen as a subset as it implies a longer-term response.\n\nBased on these, the answer is (D) The responsibility to rebuild.",

            "question": "Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\n\n(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a step-by-step explanation of what I think is the best answer:\n\nFirst, I need to understand the question a bit better. It sounds like there might be some confusion about what environmental changes are and how they could affect national security. To clarify, I'll need to look up the exact meaning of some of the key words in the question.\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of the question, I'll proceed to answering it.\n\nTo start, I'll explain that national security is a complex and multifaceted issue. It's not just about military might or foreign threats, but also about economic stability, political stability, and social stability.\n\nIn addition to understanding the complex nature of national security, it's also important to note that there are different ways that environmental changes can affect national security. For example, if an economy relies heavily on a certain resource, such as oil, and that resource becomes scarce or WOT (with oil), it can have a big impact on national security.\n\nNow that I have a better understanding of what the question is asking, I'll move on to explaining why I think answer (A) is the best answer. According to the text, environmental change can lead to economic diversification, technological advancements, and long-term growth. These advances can often boost military programs, as they give a country more options for economic and technological advancement.\n\nHowever, I will clarify that environmental challenges to economic growth are not just a matter of national security, but also have a deteriorating influence on the economic base that determines military capacity. Any negative impact on natural capital can certainly bear detriment to an economy's armed forces.\n\nHaving said that, environmental changes can pervade every aspect of society, even the military realm. There is a human-influenced impact to any development. For example, advancements in technology play a huge role in the modern military, and research is always happening to improve already existing programs.\n\nIf an economy corporations are weakened, a military will likely also weaken. While environmental changes may impact an external country's military, that doesn't mean they're will constitute an external threat in the long term. External threats remain essentially unchanged.\n\nFor the sake of my response, I'll assume answer (D) could also be correct based on my explication. Long story short: answer (D) or all three is correct.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "model_answer": "My friend, step 1) is a pro- liberal pro-energy policy as it emphasise on cooperation rather than competition in the current energy system. The statement under this option highlights how \"as long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely. It effectively argues in favour of maintaining and extending a liberal energy policy.\nStep 2) Under the given policy, it is essential to prioritise the security and independence of supply while minimising vulnerability to disruptions., thus emphasises the primacy of energy security for all consumers. It thus ensures that the liberal energy policy is sustainable and effective. You can say that (2) supports the pro-liberal policy.\nStep 3) Oil forms an essential element of liberal energy polices as its price can serve as a reference point for consumers. Its comparative advantage, therefore, translates into a sustainable energy system. It thus emphasises the importance of oil in the current energy Elliot-P Regulations\nStep 4) This optionrcipates into the potential conflict of interest between the oil and power majors at the cost of smaller suppliers left on the side lines. If anything, (4) perpetuates the influence of the Big Oil majors in shaping the global energy market.\nStep 5) There's nothing in this option that would be directly related to geopolitical tensions. The option does not promote any hostility towards power or advocate for conflict. You could say that (5) abstains from promoting any hostility towards major power house. \nStep 6) 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperatons, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict over the control of major reserves.. It also promotes the idea of a conflict.\nStep 7)validate Energy security for all consumers, if energy is scarce this also presents a threat to the intellectual property rights and technology transfer. You can say that (7) supports the pro-liberal pro-energy policy that promotes energy security for all consumers.\nStep 8)Finally, the economic model (mercantilism)  is a hyped term that does not define a different approach in the underlying motivations of the system, but rather a different method to achieve the national interests via diplomatic talks. Since you can say that the underlying motivations of given model is for achieving national interests.\n\nTherefore, the final step would be ((A)) thus the first statement can be said as liberal pro- energy policy and hence supports the pro-energy policy.\n\nNote: I have been asked to not reveal my top choice, but instead to consider the priorites and declare the reasoning behind it.",

Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking.

            "model_answer": "Sure! To answer this question, we need to ask some questions:\nWhat is energy security? \nWhat is the USA's role in securing energy security?\nWhat are the USA's strategies for securing energy security?\nLet's find out!\nFirst, we need to define some key terms:\n- What is energy security? Energy security refers to a country's ability to generate, store, and distribute energy without being excessively dependent on foreign sources. It also refers to a country's ability to protect its national security in the face of potential energy shortages or supply disruptions. Energy security is important for global economic stability and stability in individual countries, as well as for national security.\n- What is the USA's role in securing energy security? The USA has a role in securing energy security as a world superpower with global influence. Energy security is important for national security and economic stability.\n- What are the USA's strategies for securing energy security? The USA has several strategies for securing energy security, including:\n    - Increasing domestic energy production\n    - Improving energy efficiency\n    - Implementing renewable energy sources\n    - Implementing policies to reduce carbon emissions\nNow, let's examine the characteristics and manifestations of the USA's strategy for energy security:\nThe USA has sought to increase both domestic and foreign energy production and consumption. This includes both traditional energy sources like oil and gas, as well as alternative energy sources like wind, solar, and hydropower.\nThe USA has also sought to improve energy efficiency by implementing policies to reduce waste, promoting energy-saving technologies, and investing in infrastructure like buildings and vehicles.\nAdditionally, the USA has implemented policies to reduce carbon emissions, including the Paris Agreement and the Clean Power Plan.\nOverall, the USA's strategy for securing energy security is holistic and focuses on both supply and demand-side solutions.\nLet's review the answer choices:\n(A) The deployment of troops in the Persian Gulf is part of the USA's attempt to secure its dominance in the oil-rich region.\nThis option suggests that the USA is attempting to maintain control over oil production in the Persian Gulf, which runs counter to the holistic and demand-side focus of the USA's energy security strategy.\n(B) All of these options.\nThis is correct. The USA has sought toassert its primacy vis-\u00e0-vis friendly and rival powers, through the deployment of troops and other interventions. However, it has also sought to stabilize oil-rich friendly political actors and secure the economic and political status quo.\n(C) The USA has sought to assert its primacy vis-\u00e0-vis friendly and rival powers, through the deployment of troops and other interventions.\nThis option focuses too heavily on the USA's assertion of power, at the expense of other strategies like increasing domestic energy production and improving energy efficiency.\n(D) The USA has actively sought to stabilize oil-rich friendly political actors and secure the economic and political status quo.\nThis option is also incorrect. The USA's strategy for securing energy security is focused on increasing domestic and foreign energy production and consumption, improving energy efficiency, implementing policies to reduce carbon emissions, and seeking to stabilize oil-rich friendly political actors.\nOverall, the answer is (B).",
