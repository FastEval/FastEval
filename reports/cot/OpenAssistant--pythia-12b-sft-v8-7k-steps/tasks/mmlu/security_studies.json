            "question": "Which of these principles is not an element of the responsibility to protect?\n\n(A) The responsibility to prevent.\n(B) The responsibility to react.\n(C) The responsibility to remain sovereign.\n(D) The responsibility to rebuild.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Let's begin by evaluating each principle individually:\n\n(A) The responsibility to prevent - This principle holds that individuals or governments have a responsibility to prevent humanitarian disasters from occurring. In theory, this principle would include measures to prevent conflict, poverty, and environmental degradation that can lead to humanitarian crises. However, there is debate around how effectively this principle can be achieved in practice.\n\n(B) The responsibility to react - This principle acknowledges that humanitarian emergencies can arise suddenly and can be costly to address. In such situations, individuals or governments have a responsibility to quickly respond with aid and assistance. While this principle acknowledges the importance of responding to crises, it may not be sufficient for addressing the underlying causes of humanitarian emergencies.\n\n(C) The responsibility to remain sovereign - This principle holds that governments have a responsibility to protect their own citizens and maintain control over their territory. In the face of humanitarian crises, this principle may prioritize national security interests over the well-being of civilian populations. This can lead to resistance to international aid and assistance, which can hinder efforts to address humanitarian crises.\n\n(D) The responsibility to rebuild - This principle emphasizes the importance of rebuilding in the aftermath of humanitarian crises. However, this can be a challenging process, particularly in contexts of conflict or poverty. Rebuilding efforts can also be perpetually vulnerable to reverses of progress if the underlying causes of humanitarian crises remain unaddressed.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can eliminate principles (A) and (D) as elements of the responsibility to protect. Principle (B) mainly recognizes the need for quick and effective humanitarian response, which is an important element of the responsibility to protect. Principle (C), which focuses on national sovereignty, appears to prioritize national interests over the well-being of civilians, which goes against the principles of the responsibility to protect. Principle (C) is also challenging to implement in practice, given the complexities of maintaining control in conflict or post-conflict situations.\n\nWe can also eliminate the non-matching pair, principle (A) and (B), because both principles focus on different aspects of the responsibility to protect. Principle (C) cannot be eliminated with certainty, as it implies taking action in reaction to humanitarian emergencies, which is the essence of the principle. However, the principle's emphasis on taking timely action, not in reaction, may make it less objectionable in this context.\n\nIn short, the responsibility to protect is not solely limited to preventing, reacting, remaining sovereign, or rebuilding. While each principle is important in its own way, the responsibility to protect encompasses a complex and multifaceted approach. By considering a broader array of responsibilities, the international community can more effectively address the underlying causes of humanitarian crises and protect vulnerable populations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) The responsibility to rebuild.\n\nLet's put this in form of table for easy reference:\n| Principle | Reasoning | Answer |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A | Weakens focus on preventing | Eliminated |\n| B | Focuses on immediate response | Matching principle |\n| C | Prioritizes national interests | Not applicable |\n| D | Emphasizes short-term rebuilding | Matching principle |\n| E | Requires significant political will | Eliminated |\n| F | Requires significant resources | Eliminated |\n| G | Requires long-term perspective | Eliminated |\n| H | Emphasizes action beyond borders | Not applicable |\n| I | Focuses on only certain types of crises | Eliminated |\n| J | Takes a risk-averse approach | Eliminated |\n\nNote that there is no principle J, as this principle asks for an element not included in the original set of principles. Therefore, we can eliminate it and move on.",

            "question": "Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\n\n(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n\nThis is because liberals generally favour an interconnected global economy that functions through open markets and free trade, where countries work together to ensure energy security and stability for all, rather than focusing on securing energy resources for themselves. Additionally, guaranteeing a level playing field for all major powers where they can invest and operate freely would mitigate the possibility of conflict over energy reserves.\n\nBy contrast, the perspectives in questions (B) and (D) suggest that energy scarcity could signal a breakdown in international cooperation and increased geopolitical tension, respectively. While (B) does mention the possibility of a 'new international energy order,' it does not highlight the likelihood of conflict and does not share the same emphasis on cooperation and open markets. Finally, (D) suggests that energy scarcity may lead to a resurgence of resource wars, which are more typically associated with socialism or an alternative model of economic organization.\n\n(A) represents a liberal view of future energy security that emphasizes the interconnectedness of the global economy and the need for liberal markets and free trade to ensure energy security and stability for all countries.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",
