            "model_answer": "Ok, I understand. Let's proceed step-by-step:\n\nThe access matrix approach to protection has the difficulty that (A) the matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage.\nThis is because storing a large matrix directly can be memory-intensive and may require complex algorithms to manage its storage and retrieval. Additionally, such a matrix can be difficult to manage due to its size and complexity.\n\n(B) it is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements\nThe matrix approach to protection is designed to convey simple access control rules. It cannot express more complex protection requirements directly. It would require additional representational overhead to represent more complex constraints.\n\n(C) deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable\nDeciding whether a process has access to a resource using the access matrix approach is undecidable, meaning it cannot be consistently solved. The problem is called the\u5355machinegun acne residue encounter problem and is undecidable.\n\n(D) there is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself\nThere is no common mechanism for managing access control policies. This means there is no standardized way for policies to be changed, updating, or replaced. This would require significant redesign and rewriting of the system.\n\nMy final answer for this question is:\n(E) There is no straightforward way to manage access control policies using the access matrix approach, making it impractical for large-scale systems. Protection is not supported directly by the approach, but can be managed indirectly through access control policies.\n\nI hope my reasoning is clear!
