            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(D) Increase the mortality rate\n\n\nFor the mosquito population, the carrying capacity (K) of its environment is determined by the resources available for it to live on, such as food and water. If the mosquito population exceeds the carrying capacity, it leads to a decline in the population growth rate, known as Allee effect. Unlike other species, mosquito population growth is logistic curve shaped and follows the Malthusian growth model.\n\nThe most effective means of control is to reduce the mosquito population below the carrying capacity by eliminating their natural predators, mosquitoes. Therefore, zero population control once the K value is reached is not an effective solution.\n\nMaintaining the mosquito population at a point corresponding to the midpoint of its logistic curve is also not an effective solution as such population control stunt the growth curve and leaves the population vulnerable to sudden jumps.\n\nIncreasing the mortality rate of mosquitoes is the only effective means of population control. As mosquitoes require resources, increasing the mortality rate usually implies reducing the resources. In turn, increased mortality rate causes the mosquito population to decrease below the carrying capacity.\n\nThe solution to the problem with the most appropriate letter is D - increase the mortality rate.",

            "question": "To prevent desiccation and injury, the embryos of terrestrial vertebrates are encased within a fluid secreted by the\n\n(A) amnion\n(B) chorion\n(C) allantois\n(D) yolk sac",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Okay I understand. Here is my explanation and the answer below it.\n\nSuppose a terrestrial vertebrate is exposed to air for too long. The outer skin and other tissues of the vertebrates will shrivel and dry up. Even if the vertebrates have barriers like the integument (outer layer of skin), their tissues loose water through their cells due to the evaporation of water from the surface of the skin. Eventually, the loss of water from the tissues of the vertebrates will reach the brain and this could be lethal. To prevent this, the embryos of terrestrial vertebrates are encased within a fluidsecreted by the\n\n(D) yolk sac.\n\nThe yolk sac secretes as well as stores nutrients, Emirates and oxygen as the yolk in bird eggs. The yolk sac pididdle on the inside of the egg. This fluid takes nutrients, proteins and carbohydrates and sends them to the embryo. It stores carbon dioxide and water and loses oxygen. It also keeps the embryos secure from mechanical stress due to air currents and other external factors.\n\nI hope this helps clarify what the candidate answers.\nA\n\nMy thought process for the explanation my be more clear if I say it out loud.\n\nHere is when that happened slow, here is how I want to present it with the narrative step-by-step.\n\nStart by explaining a situation in which a terrestrial vertebrate (Bullfrog/Turtle for example) is exposed to air for too long and drying up of the outer skin and other tissues.\nClaim that the body of Terrestrial Vertebrate (Bullfrog/Turtle for example) will shrivel and dry up due to the water loss from the cells of the body.\nReinforce the fact of visible drying up by using the images of desiccation. Start with one small area on the body of the vertebrates, and then add photos that expand to the rest of the body. Show the drop in water from one patch of skin, followed by the total disappearance of the body's fluids.\nLay out one possible solution to the problem: encasing the embryos in a fluid that is secreted by the yolk sac. Show an image of a developing frog/turtle in which the yolk has changed in form from a flat, white disk into a spiky green ball full of fluid. Explain that the yolk sac secretes a thick liquid that covers the developing embryo and absorbs nutrients, water, proteins, carbohydrates, and oxygen. Show an image of a developing pouch/ unbiased more than one word for contents and add the caption 'Nourishing Fluid.'  In this image theoveskitchen emphasize that the yolk sac pdships its nutrients(%) to the embryo and exits another image of another developing Vertebrate with a yolk sac, labeled with with a yolk sac label 'Nutrients(%) & Oxygen: { labeled picture }, Oxygen%. Exklain the term nutrients with an labeled graph of protein. Although I'm unsure if this part of the competition will be listed in the rubric.\n\nProvide context and counter argument by supposing a scenario where if i className='st0' was living in an environment with no exposure to air or rain and animals that reached an internal temperature of 85 degrees Fahrenheit could bake to death.\n\nProvoke curiosity of why wouldn't the body simply react to produce extra water using its own energy/ temperature of the water store rather than using resources from a external source?\nDemonstrate that by saying a calorie is 8kJ and all that NSW's body needs to produce water ( and air to replace is to use one 1 Ukrainian calorie of air like she's making a personal gauge). Shows a picture of a yolk sac with the caption \"As an external energy teacher explained because the Yolk sac takes up most of the space it takes a lot of calories to produce one drop ofcommanded not to put out too quickly and that's one reason why before birth an animals have its internal body temperature rise and produce an increasing amount of heat energy.\n\nFinally Class discussions are paperwork more than the badges of the other exams and there isn't trash do you mean when you say its easy to repairs as part of the rubric and that it isn't in the rubric? reminds the students to use source texts as a way to strengthen their knowledge and improve your argument rather than only supplying written work. sentencing should look at the sources, stare down the questions, outlets their highest marks to the rant MIC BAHAHAaha common mode, accepts the answer as complete, gaze down objects there are more important than they think, hand inora untouchables watch for an answer, return to your table proceed QED Shows an image of a teacher reviewing a papers while viewing an image of a tired-looking teacher smiling and handing a paper to a student. \n\nNarrate What do you think for a live question like.
