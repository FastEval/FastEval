Before I can find the degree, I need to find the degree of each individual field extension, which I cannot do without that information.\n\nTo determine the degree, I would need to calculate the minimum polynomial of the CAMDegree() function in Mathematica. This polynomial would takeictation of each element of the minimum polynomial,https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ebraics/ CAMDegree.html, and would let me infer the degree of the Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18))over Q degree.\nThe minimum polynomial is\ufffdbned on a couples of integers (a,b) and (c,d),and is believing to the degree of aQuarticophyll}[[a,b,c,d]],where a,b,c,d are integers. Therefore, CAMDegree([[2,3,18,19],[2,10,18,14]]) would return 16+1=17.\n\nThe answer seems to be D.\nSo the degree for the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is D or 16 added to the CAM Degrees of two quadratic extensions of Q, that is D or 16+17=33.",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that. Let's start with the first step.\n\nTo verify the statement, we first need to talk about what it means for a factor group of a non-Abelian group to be non-Abelian. In general, the factor group corresponds to the normal subgroup of the permutation group that permutes the elements of the group in a way that is consistent with the group operation. A normal subgroup is one that is stable under the group operation. In particular, for aCheck the two statements sufficient and necessary conditions for finiteness?\n\nIt turns out that the same conditions apply to the factor group. If the group is non-Abelian, then so is the factor group. Therefore, we can't conclude that the factor group is non-Abelian based on the fact that the group itself is non-Abelian.\n\nLet's move on to the second step then.\n\nTo prove the statement, we can use another fact from Group Theory: If H is a subgroup of G and K is a subgroup of H, then K is also a subgroup of G.\n\nNow let's apply this fact to the statement. Let G be a non-Abelian group, H be its unique normal subgroup, and K be a normal subgroup of H.\n\nTo prove that K is normal in G, we need to show that (i) H=KH and (ii) NH=G for all n \u2208 N.\n\nProof of (i): Z(G) is the center of G, which is the unique normal subgroup of G. Therefore, H has trivial intersection with Z(G). Since H is a subgroup of G, it follows that H\u2282G.\n\nProof of (ii): Let n be an integer such that nH\u2282H. We need to show that H\u2282nG. Define a map phi:H\u00d7H\u2192G by (h1,h2)\u21a6h1\u22121h2. This map is a group embedding because H\u00d7H is a group and the inverse image of the identity element and the image are both equal to H. Since K is a normal subgroup of H, it follows that K is also the image of phi(1,1) under this embedding. This means that nKH\u2282K. The reverse inclusion also holds, so we have nKH=K. Therefore, NH=G for all n \u2208 N.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that K is normal in G.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is also true, and the answer is (C) True, False.",
