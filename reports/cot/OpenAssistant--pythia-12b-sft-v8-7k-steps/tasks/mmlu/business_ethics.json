            "model_answer": "The answer to this questions step-by-step is:\n\n(D) Traditional currency, Expensive, Unsecure, Charitable giving\n\nMy reasoning was as follows:\n1. Start with the provided information.\n2. The first word that stands out is \"Expensive\" which tells me that the answer will have something to do with cost.\n3. Following this, the information tells us that this is not secure or \"Unsecure.\" Since \"Unsecure\" pairs nicely with \"Expensive,\" my best guess for the middle word(s) is that it(or they) pair with \"Expensive\" in some way to give me the word \"Cheap.\"\n4. As for the last word, the information tells us both that this method of giving is not secure orCharitable, the best word that fits this description is \"Unsecure\". Putting it together, \"Expensive Unsecure Charitable giving\" is what we're given as our answer.",

            "question": "Typical advertising regulatory bodies suggest, for example that adverts must not: encourage _________, cause unnecessary ________ or _____, and must not cause _______ offence.\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that! Here's my step-by-step explanation and the answer at the end:\n\nI gotta say, I'm not so sure about this whole \"advert\" thing . . . but if I was, I would want to make sure that it was all above board and safe. That's why I say that the regulatory bodies suggest that ads should not encourage \"unsafe practices, wants, Fear, Trivial\" ( sugge\nsting that people get obsessed with material things without regard for their health or well-being).\nThis suggests that ads should be safe and healthy-minded. It would also make sense that ads should not cause any unnecessary \"Distress, Fear, Serious\" ( Dolus Effects - which can refer to fear of possible harm) or \"Offence\" ( which, literally, means \"to wound the sense of sight or smell, or to arouse strong resentment instead of sympathy\"). These all sound pretty serious, and not something you want to betags associated with your advertising efforts.\n\nThat said, I'm not sure I agree with the \"Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\" code. I don't think people's wants should be trivial. I mean, if I want someone to buy something, I should be able to back my argument up with something relevant!\n\nSo, based on what we discussed above, my answer is:\n\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial.\n\nAs a follow-up (and as a way of checking my own understanding), I'd be grateful if you could confirm that your understanding of the information we've discussed so far is consistent with the rest of the passage.",

            "model_answer": "Sure! Let's break it down step by step:\n\n    What is the preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities of employees?\n\nMany employers have an workplace where most of the time is spent working, representing the work-related activities. These are typically jobs that do not require much commuting or do not relate to personal life. In other words, the ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities is considered important by employees for the sake of maintained mental health and well-being.\n\n    What has become a hotly contested issue in recent years?\n\nWhat has made this issue become a hotly contested one is the increasing demand of workers to produce more, work longer and harder. This leads workers to focus more on work at the expense of other activities in their life, including personal and leisure time. \n\nTheBN wins the bet",
