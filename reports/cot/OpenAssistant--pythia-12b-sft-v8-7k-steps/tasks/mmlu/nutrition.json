            "model_answer": "Sure, I understand. Here are the steps to answer the question properly:\n\n considers the prevalence of a disease in a population over time. If incidence rate (the new cases of the disease per unit time) is falling, which means that the disease becoming less common in the population, then prevalence would be increasing. Two extreme situations would cause this:\n\nIf incidence rate is zero, prevalence is also zero because there are no new cases.\nIf absolute majority of cases are preventable or vaccine-protected, prevalence would no longer depend on new cases but solely on the number of vaccine-protected individuals remaining in the population. In such situation prevalence would not be affected by changes to incidence. Dictatorship is an obvious example of such situation.\nTherefore, given an incidence rate, we can classify each individual factor as follows:\n\nIf incidence rate is falling:\nprevalence will increase\nhypertension\nrate of depression\nprevalence will increase\nweakening of immune system due to climate change\nprevalence will increase\nsocioeconomic inequality\nIf incidence rate is rising:\nprevalence will decrease\ngender identity disorder\nrate of autism\nprevalence will decrease\nmalnutrition\nprevalence will decrease\n Ctrl+C Ctrl+V",

The answer is (A) Vitamin A.\n\nStep 1: A vitamin is a compound that is required for the existence and/or well-being of an organism. Calcium is essential for the proper functioning of the human body.\n\nStep 2: Calcium is absorbed from the small intestine of the human body. This absorption is influenced by various vitamins and minerals, including vitamin D, vitamin K and vitamin C.\n\nStep 3: Vitamin A, D and K are essential nutrients for the survival and growth of all animals. Vitamin A is needed for the normal functioning of the eye and vision. Vitamin D is necessary for calcium absorption in the body. Vitamin K is involved in the fragmentation of blood clotting proteins.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, based on the given description and given importance of each vitamin in human physiology, it can be concluded that Vitamin A, D and K do not influence positively calcium absorption from the small intestine.\n\nStep 5: The only known critical nutrient needed for calcium absorption is Vitamin D.\n\nStep 6: Therefore the answer is (A) Vitamin A.

            "model_answer": "Since this is anquiromat, I don't know much about metabolic demand. However, since the other three statements I know:\n\na) (A) The metabolic demand is supplied only from the diet, could be false because your body needs the amino acids to stay healthy but you can still produce them by your own. They just need to be replaced sometimes when we eat.\n\nb) (B) The metabolic demand is to maintain protein turnover. This also could be false because this sounds like a very bad excuse for not eating. If you don't eat, you will slowly but surely die. The body needs food to keep working and if it doesn't, it stops guiding cells for DNA copying and cell reproduction. Unfortunately this is when cell reproduction and maintenance is stopped it also means cell repair and you start dying.\n\nc) (C) The metabolic demand involves consumption of amino-acids by a number of irreversible pathways and these are either obligatory or adaptive. This is also false. Depending on the content of your diet different intestinal microbes will live in your body and these microbes need to consume nutrients so they can also take up amino acids. Therefore amino acids can not be considered as irreversible since they are also consumed by others.\n\nd) (D) The metabolic demand is a fixed amount.
