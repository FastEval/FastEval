            "question": "One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\n(B) admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\n(C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n(D) inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The attorney's testimony is admissible.\n\nReasoning:\nThe lawyer's testimony is admissible under an exception to the attorney-client privilege if the client has given legal advice, or if the lawyer is an expert about a particular subject matter, or if certain conditions are met. In this case, the client filed a lawsuit against the pilot, which waives the attorney-client privilege and makes the lawyer's testimony admissible. Therefore, statement (A) and (C) are incorrect. Statement (B) is also incorrect because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation. Therefore, only statement (A) can be correct. Statement (D) is incorrect because the statement at issue is not a statement of physical condition, but rather a description of the boy's injury during the consultation. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) admitted.",

            "question": "A state statute provides: \"Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. \" Violation of the statute is made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault.

Here's my explanation:\nStep 1: The question states that the taxpayer was notified that her individual income tax was underpaid by $1,012.69. This means that the underpayment was based on the amount she was supposed to have paid in taxes, rounded to the nearest dollar.\nStep 2: The question also states that the taxpayer retained an attorney. This means she chose to have an attorney represent her in contesting the underpayment.\nStep 3: The question then states that during the preparation of the taxpayer's case, the attorney suggested that she hire an accountant.\nStep 4: The next step asks if the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend. This means the accountant she hired was from her family or a friend.\nStep 5: The last step asks if the taxpayer's attorney referred to a financial statement prepared by the accountant during the trial.\nStep 6: The question then asks what the answer should be. The six possible answers are:\n(A) inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n(B) inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.\n(C) inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.\n(D) admissible as an admission.\nStep 7: The final line contains the answer with parenthesis: (D) admissible as an admission.",

            "question": "A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order\n\n(A) valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\n(B) valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\n(C) invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\n(D) invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.",

For the sake of the explanation, let's assume that standing is adequate.\nStep 2: No. The President does not have unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in international relief efforts. That authority exists in US Code Title 22, Chapter 1, Part II, Subpart A, Section 3101 et seq., commonly known as the Insurrection Act. This act specifically outlines the powers and responsibilities of the President during times of rebellion or civil strife, including the power to call forth the military to put down the rebellion. The President's powers during times of a natural disaster are less clear cut, and there is a chance that this act would be deployment overseas without explicit congressional approval.\nStep 3: (A) valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform emergency functions.\nStep 4: (D) invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.

Incident to a lawful arrest: This exception allows law enforcement to search a person or their property shortly after an arrest to ensure that the arrest is lawfully made and to prevent the suspect from attacks or access to weapons.\n\n3.
