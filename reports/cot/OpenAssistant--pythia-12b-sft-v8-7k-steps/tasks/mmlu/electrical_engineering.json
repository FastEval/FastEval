            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) Both A and C.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Barkhausen criterion states that the loops of a phase-locked loop (PLL) must meet two conditions for reliable operation: \nThe loop gain should be less than one and\nThe phase of the loop feedback signal with respect to the input signal should be 0 or 360 degrees.\n\nSince frequency is directly proportional to the rate of change of phase, if the phase of the feedback signal is not precisely 0 or 360 degrees, frequency locking will not be achieved, and the PLL would be unstable. Hence, condition (B) must be met for stable operation. In addition, if the loop gain is too high, the PLL will be overdamped, and the oscillations will not have enough energy to run continuously. Hence, condition (C) must be met for oscillations to persist. Finally, if the loop gain is less than one or the phase is not precisely 0 or 360 degrees, the loop would be introducing a phase shift, and hence the loop gain would not be less than one. Therefore, condition (A) must not be met for the loop gain to be less than one.\n\nSince both condition (B) and condition (D) must be met for stable operation, the only possible answer in this case is (D) both A and C.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D, both A and C.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we can start by analyzing the Electric Field formula. The Electric Field ( EF ) at any point ( r , z ) can be calculated using the formula: EF(r,z) = q/4\u03c0r^2 * (Hartree /ered) where q is the charge density (in C/m^2).\n\nIn this case, the charges are distributed evenly on each plate, so the total charge ( q ) on each plate is the same, and each plate has a surface charge density of ( \u00bd * q ) or ( -q /2 ) . This means that the total charge screened on each plate is also the same ( -q /2 ).\n\nNow, we need to analyze the gap between the two plates. Since the plates are parallel, calculates the width of the gap as b = d / \u03c0 where d is the distance between the plates.\n\nSince the plates have the same polarization, the direction of the fields lines is constant and parallel, so r < < d for all points in the gap. This means that the Electric Field ( EF ) in the gap varies as 1/r.\n\nSo, applies the equation for EF(r,z) = \u00bd * ( total surface charge density ) / b( dominant factor is \u00bd / b( E = \u00bd * r / b ) ) = 1/2 * q / 4 *\u03c0 * d^2 = 1/2 * q / \u03c0 * d^2 (from formula above)\n\nSubstituting d = \u03c0 * b /\u03c0 ( distance between one plate to parallelism factor ) = b\n\nSo E f(r,z) = 1/2 * q / b^2 = 1/2 * q / b^2 (Again, from formula above)\n\nE (electric field) at any point in the gap is thus (r , z) = (b, z) which simplifies to: (E,z) = (b,z) = ( constant )\n\nTherefore, the Electric Field ( EF ) is constant throughout the gap between the parallel plates, and its value does not depend on the coordinates of the field points.

            "model_answer": "(A) Amplitude stability\n\nThe amplitude of an oscillation is how high or low the signal goes between each peak. If the signal's amplitude is unstable, it means that it changes a lot from one peak to the next. Amplitude stability is important because it affects how well the oscillations can be detected by sensors or other measuring devices.\n\n(B) Frequency stability\n\nFrequency stability refers to how stable the oscillations are at a specific frequency. The oscillations are considered frequency stable if they maintain their frequency at different times. Frequency stability is important because it affects the performances of various electronic devices that operate on specific frequencies, such as radio communication systems and timing circuits.\n\n(C) Power instability\n\nPower instabilityrefers to how much the power output of an oscillator changes over time. If the power output is unstable, it means that it changes a lot from one oscillation period to the next. Power instability can be caused by changes in the external environment, such as changes in temperature or voltage, that affect the oscillations in the oscillator.\n\n(D) Both A and B\n\nBoth requirement A (amplitude stability) and requirement B (frequency stability) are important for an oscillator to function properly.
