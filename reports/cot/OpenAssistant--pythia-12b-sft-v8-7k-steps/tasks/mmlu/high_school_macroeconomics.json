            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Sure, here\u2019s my explanation:\n\nThe large increase in real output, combined with a small increase in the price level, suggests that the economy was operating below its full- PATHWAY.\n\nThe text specifically mentioned that an expansionary fiscal policy resulted in a large increase in real output, which suggests that real demand had been downwardly sloped prior to the policy. That, combined with the small decrease in price level, suggests that aggregate supply was barely above capacity.\n\nNow, we can assume that a long-run YoY average of 1% quarterly GDP inflation combined with a relatively flat distribution curve would indicate that the economy was fairly close to its full-PATHWAY potential.\n\nTherefore, the combination of increased real output and a slightly-higher-than-normal price level leads me to conclude that aggregate demand at the time doesn\u2019t need to be Considered. instead I believe that the medium/long-term impact reflects the fact that the initial upward vertical force in the IS-S function was weak, combined with the downward sloping real demand curve. For this reason, I believe the medium/long-term impact was textual Inversion biased.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) aggregate supply decreased.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Sure I understand. I will do my best to provide a step-by-step answer until the final line with the correct lettering. \n\n(A) \"nominal GDP falls.\" - There is always some rubbery variance in nominal GDP over time even if it remains positive. Thus a fall in nominal GDP would indicate someKh parenthesis for the market indexes or people would reduce their extravagance with a corresponding shrink in consumption.\n\n(B) \"the nominal interest rate falls.\" The nominal interest rates are probably figured using the LV=(1+r)^(-n) formula where r is the real interest rate and n is the number of periods over the time frame of evaluating interest rates. Thus when real interest rates fall in isolation, it tends to increase LV. Since LV is then used as a discount factor in computing bond prices, it tends to drive down interest rates, which hence has a negative sentence. Thus the answer is (B).\n\n(D) \"the supply of money falls\" - This answer choice is incomplete. According to conventional wisdom, the demand for money is an emergent property of the overall financial system determined by 1) the preferences of household, security and even corporate firms, and also AP impact through shocks like a war, global economic turmoils etc. 2) international spillovers, and also 3) global aggregate income. Thus the supply of money can go up or down due to real shifts in say the economy under (A) and (D) and the (C). Thus the answer is not (D) unless you can justify to me that households simply demand more money no matter what the supply of money is. If the only reason is a decrease in the supply of money that originates from some shocks in the real economy, (A) would be the best answer. Because then households would not care about (C) because their budgets remain the same whether the currency is devalued or the monetary aggregates contracted. Bond prices plummet then and rise again later. The households stay the same.\n\nTherefore we end the game after 1) looking for fundamentals like taxes changes, innovation in household income sources etc. 2) the identities of administrations doing the nimKh noodles and the changes in shades (A, B, C, D). 3) Inflows or coefficients of real('880K) properly computed to match what we discover to what we need. \n\nThank you very much for playing!

Let's call this natural unemployment rate ' '.\n\nAt the natural rate of unemployment, unemployed individuals will simply appear out of thin air. There will be no induced or structural unemployment. Thus, if an organization were to hire anyworkers inJapanwho are currentlyunemployed, they need not worry about inducing or structural unemployment.\n\nSince the inflation rate is the percentage change in the general price level of all goods and services in an economy over a certain time period, the first step in determining the inflation rate is to find the general price level. In Japan, the general price level is around JPY 480 trillion. The population of Japan is approximately 126 million, so the general price level per person is JPY 11,520.\n\nBecause the inflation rate is the percentage change in the general price level, it will be given by:\n\n(Percentage change / JPY 480 trillion) x JPY 11,520 = JPY 48/trillion\n\nThe numerical value at the end of the inflation rate must be a whole number and, because of this constraint, the numerical value cannot exceed 3. Therefore, the answer must be 3.\n\nYes and no. It depends upon why unemployment exists. If unemployment is structural, then it could be due to the fact that workers will not take any job that pays less than what they are now being paid. jobs that are available pay less than workers can accept. A higher unemployment rate in Japan suggests that the structural unemployment rate is higher, and the natural rate of unemployment is lower (as mentioned above).\n\nD.)
