We can list out the factors of 1200 in ascending order, which are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. According to theparticle recommendation, \"Only one of the numbers 2, 3, 5,7,11 is a factor of 1200, so these are the numbers we don't count. Now, we have the prime factorizationistered, we'll count the remaining counting numbers step by step\". Similarly, since 13 is a factor of 1200, we don't count it out, and the only counting number left is 11.\nNow we have a set of numbers who divide 1200, including 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. We need to count all positive integer values of n which divide each of these numbers evenly and sum them up.\nAs we know each number is an odd number greater than 1, thus, our counting numbers' odd numbers multiply factors, and even numbers always divide factors:\n$n | 2 \\ | \\ 3 \\ | \\ 5 \\ | \\ 7 \\ | \\ 11 \\ | \\ 13$\n$n | 2$   | 2   | 2   | 2   | 4    | 4    | $n=13$ is not an option as it is even, and 12 factorizes only 1 times.\n$n | 4$   | 2   | 4   | 2   | 8    | 8    | $n=8$ is not an option as it is even, and 7 factorizes only 1 times.\n\nIn summary, the only counting number is 11 $(n=11)$, and the only positive integer value of n which divides 11 evenly and is greater than 11 are:\n$n | 11$   | 11   | 11   | 11   | 11    | $n=11$ is not an option, we can exclude this value.\n$n | 11$   | 11   | 11   | 11   | 11    | 11 is the only corresponding positive integer value(no need to output).\n(D) 39.\n\nAs the answer with parenthesis only has a single character, 39.
