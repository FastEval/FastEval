(A) answers the question.\n\nThere are other reasons why IR spectroscopy is useful for determining the structure of organic molecules:\n\nC) most organic functional groups absorb in a characteristic region of the IR spectrum.\n\nExplanation: Organic molecules can have different functional groups, such as carbonyls, amines, alcohols, gegeners, etc. Those groups have specific absorption spectra in the infrared region of the spectrum. (C) is the best answer.\n\nD) each element absorbs at a characteristic wavelength.\n\nExplanation: No, this is not true. Each element has its own set of infrared absorption bands at characteristic wavelengths. (D) is not correct.\n\nIR spectroscopy is a powerful technique used to obtain structural and chemical information about organic molecules (complex organic molecules) from their infrared (IR) spectral data. IR spectroscopy is different from ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, which measures the absorption or transmission of electromagnetic radiations through a transparent sample. In IR spectroscopy, the Spectrometer measures the infrared radiation emitted or absorbed from a heated sample, while visible light and near-infrared radiations pass through the sample.\n\nIR spectroscopy measures the intensity of the infrared radiation (which increases or decreases as the sample temperature changes), and measures the wavelength (color) of the infrared radiation absorbed by the sample. IR spectroscopy reveals important information about the sample\u2019s chemical composition and the geometric configuration of its bonds, including bond type, bonding patterns, COSON increased scientific understanding of complex materials, including organic andopezide materials.\n\nIn summary answer: (A) All molecular bonds absorb IR radiation.",
