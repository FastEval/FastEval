If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) 164%\n\nStep-by-Step Instructions:\n\n1. Convert $98,000 to cents: 98,000 * 100 = 98,000 cent\n2. Convert $245 per hour to cents: $245 * 100 = $2450 cent\n3. Estimate daily costs at $50 per day: $2450 / 2 = $1225 cent\n4. Add daily costs to yield annualized daily costs: $1225 + $1225 + $98,000 = $3098,000 cent\n5. Multiply annualized costs by 4: $3098,000 cent * 4 = $12,192,000 cent\n6. Divide by 365: $12,192,000 cent / 365 = $33, ref small percent\n7. Perform the following calculation: $33 / 98000 = 0.034 interact, nines\n8. Convert $0.034 to per cent: 0.034 * 100 = 3.4 ref percent\n9. Add the per-cent values of the interest rates to get the final answer: (3.4 + 164)% = 169%\n\nThe answer is 169%, with parenthesis, hence \"A\" - \"D\"\u2122",
