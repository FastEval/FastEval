            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the daily cost of renting the limousine.\nDaily cost = $245/hour x 2 hours = $490\n\nStep 2: Calculate the daily yield on the investment.\nDaily yield = Daily cost / purchase price = $490 / $98,000 = 0.005 around 0.05%\n\nStep 3: Estimate the yearly yield on the investment.\nSince the rental is expected to be 2 hours a day, we can calculate the yearly yield as follows:\nYearly yield = Daily yield x 2 = 0.005 x 2 = 0.01\n\nSo, the estimated yearly yield on your investment is 0.01 or 1%, which is (D) 183%.\n\nFinishing with the final line containing:\n(D) 183%",
