Rivalry among existing firms\n\nNow, let's examine the behaviour of organisations within the industry and identify the specific competitive activity present between them.\n\n(A) Potential for entry\nIn a highly competitive industry or market, organisations frequently face challenges of entry by new and innovative competitors. In such cases, the organisation must be prepared to adapt quickly to survive and thrive. Potential entry by new firms represents a new threat to existing firms, and therefore, a potential source of substitute products or services.

            "model_answer": "(A) Workers enjoy responsibility.\n\n McGregor's Theory X suggests that workers often resist change and prefer to maintain the status quo. Therefore, one of the key assumptions of this theory is that workers generally enjoy taking responsibility for their work and finding satisfaction in achieving a task successfully. (A) workers enjoy responsibility is consistent with this theory.  \n\nHere's the logical flow for the answer:\n\nThe Features of McGregor's Theory X\n5. Workers view physical and mental effort as a natural part of work.\n6. Workers like to show initiative.\n7. Workers do not try to avoid working, but prefer to seek challenge and responsibility.\n8. Workers are afraid of making mistakes.\n\n(B) Workers view physical and mental effort as a natural part of work.\n\n9. Workers view physical and mental effort as a natural part of work.\nUnder McGregor\u2019s Theory X, workers generally see physical and mental effort as a natural part of work. This assumption is supported by the fact that workers enjoy working with people and remain largely inactive during non-work hours. In this sense, workers view physical and mental effort as a natural part of work. \n\n(C) Workers like to show initiative\n\n11. Workers like to show initiative.\nUnder McGregor\u2019s Theory X, workers are generally in favor of being in control, and therefore, are likely to like showing initiative by taking on new tasks, setting their own goals, and defining their own roles. This assumption is supported by the fact that workers like to try new things, typically take control over their own destiny, and tailor their work efforts to fill specific goals that become increasingly important over time.\n\n12. Workers do not try to avoid working, but prefer to seek challenge and responsibility.\n\n13. Workers are afraid of making mistakes.\n\n14. Workers feel backup and loyalty to their peers and superiors.\n\n\n#\n\n(D) Workers like to be directed.\n\nThis assumption is not logical as the assumption of the theory is that workers are fearful of change and havelimited Incarna- tion Control) confidence in their abilities. The theory thereforeassumes that workers prefer to remain stagnant and go through the motions without taking responsibility for their own progress or direction.\n\nThe answer can now be summarize as (A) workers enjoy responsibility.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Before discussing the answer, I'd like to stress that the question is quite vague. Although the answer involves money, the term used in the question could refer to various forms of power derived from position or status. Some possible answers include \"referent\", \"expert\", \"legitimate\", and \"reward\".\n\nHowever, the most likely answer in this case is (B) \"Expert\". This is because the question is asking for a term related to *power derived from status or position in an organization*, and (B) \"Expert\" most closely aligns with that description. It refers to people with specialized knowledge or expertise in their fields, and can refer to individuals who possess power that is dependent on their abilities and contributions, rather than on their position or status *per se*. Furthermore, a theoretical definition of \"expert\" in this context might be someone who has been granted credibility or recognition by their peers or employers through demonstrated expertise rather than formal authority or power.\n\nIn summary, (B) \"Expert\" is the most likely answer to the question \"What is the term for power derived from status or position in an organization?\" given the information in the question and the context in which it is typically used.",
