Since the points A and B divided the segment into two segments, the smaller segments consisted of one of A, B, or both. There are only two ways in which two points can divide the segment into three smaller segments of length 1: (A) when both points divide the segment, and (B) when only one point divides the segment.\n\nThe number of possibilities is calculated by choosing one of the points A or B once, and the remaining pointsuit twice. Therefore, the number of possibilities is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nThe probability P of this event can be calculated by the formula P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(AB) - P(AC) + P(BC) - P(ABC), where P(ABC) is the probability that A, B, and C form the sides of a triangle.\n\nSince the two segments formed by the chosen points form a triangle automatically, we did not need to consider the case AB, AC, and BC. This means there are only 3 feasible cases: ABC, ACB, and BAC.\n\nP(AB) = 0 because the two points are chosen independently.\nP(AC) = 0 because we did not consider AC in the other cases.\nP(BC) = 0 because we did not consider BC in the other cases.\nTherefore, the only case remaining is ABC, the probability of which is 10%. The final answer is therefore P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(AB) - P(AC) + P(BC) - P(ABC) = 10%.",
