            "model_answer": "Sure, I can help you with that!\n\nStep 1: Identify the instructions in the program\nThe first step is to identify the instructions in the program. In this case, the program consists of a single instruction: println().\n\nStep 2: Determine the kinds of fuzzers\nNow we need to determine the types of fuzzers. We know that there are three types of fuzzers: generational, blackbox, and whitebox. \nGenerational fuzzers start with a set of random seeds and then create new seed values based on the fitness of the new values. Blackbox fuzzers start with a technicalFROM the program and create new seed values by trying different strings. Whitebox fuzzers start with the targetTarget and try to modify the target using byte syntax.\n\nStep 3: Compare the effectiveness of the fuzzers\nGenerational fuzzers can explore paths covering every line of code because they use random seeds to create new values and are not limited by the structure of the program. Therefore, generational fuzzers are more likely to explore paths covering every line of code than blackbox or whitebox fuzzers.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer\nBased on the above analysis, Generational fuzzers are more likely to explore paths covering every line of code than blackbox and whitebox fuzzers. Therefore, the answer is (A) Generational.",

What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",

            "model_answer": "Therfore, the correct step-by-step answer to this question is:\n\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.\n\nWhen the client initially connects to a KDC, the latter sends to the former a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) and a Kerberos key to the client.\nIf the client is allowed to connect, the KDC will send to the client arenewal-TGT; to be able to access the server, the client must now request a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) from the KDC and send it in its next request, for a maxium of 24 hours.\nIf the client is authorized to access the server, the TGT sent, will have an expiration date, as defined above.\n upon completion ofauthorized access, the client delivers the TGT to the server, which requests a Kerberos key from the KDC. \nUpon receiving the request for the Kerberos key from the server, the KDC will check if the TGT is still worth while. \nThe KDC scans its local database to see if the ticket has expireied and the system administrator has manually deleted it from the database. To reduce the load introduced to the KDC server; if the TGT is past its due date and has not been deleted, the KDC will look at a rfc4511 timestamps to determine wether it can trust the TGT.\nIf the data is still good, the KDC will deliver to the server the Kerberos key or a ticket-granting ticket for a maxium of 24 hours. At this point, the server has now 215 and can communicate amongst its services.",
