            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Okay, I understand the instructions. Here is my response, in the order given:\n\nStep 1: Unlike most other early civilizations, Minoan culture shows little evidence of trade. This is because Minoan culture did not have a strong maritime tradition or a vast coastline, so they did not engage in extensive trading activities with other nations.\nStep 2: Unlike most other early civilizations, Minoan culture shows little evidence of warfare. This is because Minoan culture were peace-loving people who did not engage in armed conflicts with other civilizations.\nStep 3: Unlike most other early civilizations, Minoan culture shows little evidence of the development of a common religion. This is because Minoan culture did not have a centralized religion or a consistent religious tradition, so they did not invest much in religious practices or rituals.\nStep 4: Unlike most other early civilizations, Minoan culture shows little evidence of conspicuous consumption by elites. This is because Minoan culture did not have the economic means or social status to engage in lavish, extravagant behaviors, so they tended to live simply and focus on immediate needs rather than material possessions.\n\nAfter analyzing all of the evidence, I believe that the answer to the question is (D) conspicuous consumption by elites. This answer is supported by information about Minoan trade, warfare, religion, and social structure, which suggests that Minoan culture had a class divide, with elites living in luxury and those living in poverty. However, while Minoan elites did engage in conspicuous consumption, it was not a distinctive feature of their culture, but rather a reflection of their social and economic circumstances. In summary, my reasoning and answer are:\n\n(D) conspicuous consumption by elites.\n\nDoes this answer meeting the requirements of the prompt?",

            "model_answer": "Great, I'm ready to help you with the pyramids of Giza! Here's the answer step-by-step:\n\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza, which is known also as the Pyramid of Khufu, was built around Statius cube, an architectural plan known for its precise angles. This plan can be compared to the geometry of a rectangular prism. Statius cube used corner stones which stood firmly while the pyramid was being built.\nIt was built during the Fourth Dynasty which ruled from 2613-2490 BCE.\nConstruction of the pyramids was done by skilled and experienced Egyptians who had been trained since youth. However, during the organic period of Egyptian history when they were the rulers of a high developed civilisation, millions of poor farmers who were forced to construct the pyramids, were mobilized by the government against their will.\nThe answer is: A, as burial monuments for the pharaoh Khufu, Khufu's son Khafre, and Khufu's grandson Menkaure.\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",

Along the edges of the ditch, a series of huge stones, nicknamed \u201c Aubrey Holes,\u201d are found arranged in aStar-an ceremonial pattern comprised of five aligned rows of three stones on three sides of the ditch with two remaining stones across the entrance- called the Align Hans Barrow , which represents the 260km of oval tracks\u2014 oval meaning the direction of the moon and sun. The Aubrey holes are thought to date to circa 2600 BC preparing and aligning for the greatest of the ceremonies in earth time, the summer solstice around 21 June.

Most are straight or slightly curved, however one is missing a first half and the joins in the middle are slightly off centre. All totaled, thirty legumes and thirty sarsens form a circuit.
