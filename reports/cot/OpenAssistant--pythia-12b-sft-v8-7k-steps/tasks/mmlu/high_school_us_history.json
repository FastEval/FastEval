The most likely consequence of a sudden attack by a neighboring country is economic. The most likely consequence is trade decreased between the two nations. As for the question, the best statement describes the economic consequence of the attack.\n\nTherefore, the best statement describes the economic consequence of the declaration of war is:\n\n(A) Decreased trade with Asian nations precipitated economic recession in both the United States and Europe.\n\nOverall, the United States would have a decreased trade with Asia because of the attack. This decrease in trade would cause economic recession in both the United States and Europe. The decrease in trade would force both sides to decrease production levels, leading to a decrease in economic activity. The decrease in economic activity would cause a decrease in trade because both sides would lay low due to the decreased economic activity. The lowered trade between the US and Asia as well as the European nations further fueled the recession.\n\nPreviously, I also pointed out that the decrease in trade forced both sides to decrease production levels. Since both sides would decrease production, there would be a decrease in demand for products. Due to the decrease in demand for products, there would be a decrease in supply of products. With the decreased supply of products, the prices would go up due to the decrease in competition in the market. With the decreased demand for products and the high prices, there would be economic recession.\n\nOverall, the economic consequence of the declaration of war is economic recession in both the United States and Europe.\n\nOverall Lodge: - A",
