One reason for this is that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. To understand better how this could be the case, we can consider what happened in the wake of the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, which granted all citizens regardless of race the right to vote. With this right came the hope that black people would be able to vote with new intensity and pressure their elected officials to pass laws to address their longstanding social, economic, and political grievances. However, little was done to promote education for black Americans. To protect rust belt jobs the US government paid for the construction of schools in poor, black neighborhoods. This was known as the Rural Schools Program.\nA. The Great Society\n\nIn the late 1960s, as the Civil Rights Movement and black power movements advocated for change, a program was begun called the Great Society. The program aimed to improve the lives of all Americans, especially the poor and the disabled. It financed organizations that promoted Positive Deviance, a program intended to teach poor communities how to tap into their own knowledge and traditions to solve their own problems. The idea was that good health care, education, and economic stability would come from knowledge of one's own history.\n\nGiven these facts, the correct answer is (A) The Great Society. The great Society program funded organizations like the National Organizations for the Disabled, which promoted Good Health and Positive Deviance, thus improving the lives of the African American community during the civil rights movement.",

They want to provide a minimum standard of living to all families, which is estimated to be about $5,000. The society wants to limit the prevalence of poverty in the country.\n\nBased on Long's proposals, it can be concluded that he does not want to divide wealth equally, but rather limit the wealth of certain individuals. His proposals focus on increasing the wealth of families by limiting the wealth of certain individuals.\n\nTherefore, the best response by FDR would be (C) Diverting people's attention by allowing the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor.
