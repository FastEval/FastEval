Using Hx, we can determine that the Structures in question are houses and not apartments. Lx means the Objects Pronouns are large (in combination withAx, we can infer that the structures are at least 2 floors). In addition to Hx, we can infer with Ax that there is a structure containing a river. Using Lx, again, we can infer theaters and not houses or apartments. We can also use Ay \u2283 Bx to infer that Alcoats are large and floating. Finally, we can conclude that some riverbank cannot contain an apartment because Hx \u2022 (\u2200y) means that if every house has property Lx, and if Hx \u2260 R apartment, then Hx \u2022 (\u2200y) must be false.\n\nBehavior shows (B) is true simply because (a) Ay \u2283 Bxy, (b) most expressions describing rivers describe bodies of water and that do not have floors, and (c) Ax \u2022 Hx is false because in the Zermelo-Fraenkel axiom, there are no ways to extend the property Hx to all iterations of x.

Specifically, when K and L are both true, the argument returns false, which indicates that the right-hand side of the conjunction is evaluated to false, which in turn satisfies the left-hand side of the conjunction. This indicates that the argument is not satisfied, making it invalid.\n\nNow, let's move onto determining whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n\nIf the argument is invalid, there must be a value of K and L that satisfies the argument yet returns false. There are two cases to consider:\n\n- When K is true and L is false. In this case, the argument evaluates to:\n   ((K \u2261 L) / (K \u00b7 L)) \u2228 (K \u00b7 ~L)\n   This returns (K \u00b7 L) \u2295 (K \u00b7 ~L), which is false.\n\n- When K is false and L is true.

If K or L is false in a valid argument, the argument is still invalid.\n- For each case where either K or L is true, there is a corresponding case where the other variable is true and the argument is invalid. Therefore, we can conclude that there is at least one counterexample for each of the cases where either K or L is true.\n- If we allow the variables to be both true or both false, there are four possible cases where both variables could be true or both could be false. In each of these cases, there is a corresponding case where only one variable is true. Therefore, there is at least one additional counterexample that includes these cases.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that there is at least one and at most three counterexamples for the given argument.",
