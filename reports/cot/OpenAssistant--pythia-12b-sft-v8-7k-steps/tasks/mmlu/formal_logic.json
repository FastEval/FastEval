In other words, either there are bigger apartments than houses or there aren't. Since the question asks for the best English interpretation, let's assume (A) is the better interpretation and conclude:\n\n> The best English translation of the original proposition is \"Some large houses are bigger than some apartments.\"\n\n(B) Some houses are bigger than all large apartments.\n\nWe'll do a similar investigation for (B):\n\n(B) (F \u2192 T) \u2228 (T \u2192 T)\n\n(B) (F \u2192 T) \u2228 (T \u2192 T)\n\nAssuming we are working with classical logic, we can simplify the right-hand side even further:\n\n(B) (F \u2192 T)\n\nFor a moment, let's assume that this is true. Can we come to a conclusion about whether or not houses are bigger than apartments based on it? Since we know that an apartment will be bigger than a house in a situation where (A) is true, there must be a situation where (A) is true and then (B) is also false. This is because (B) requires the alternatives (\"all large apartments\") to be mutually exclusive when (A) is true, and we have demonstrated the converse (a situation where (A) is true might allow both alternatives to be true at once). Therefore, we cannot assert that the above assumption holds true.\n\nWe can conclude that (B) is false. Thus:\n\n> The best English interpretation of the original proposition is (D) \"Some houses are bigger than some large apartments.\"\n\n(C) Some large apartments are bigger than some houses.\n\n(C) (F \u2192 T)\n\nAssuming we(*) are working with classical logic, we can simplify the right-hand side even further:\n\n(C) (F \u2192 T)\n\nAdvancing our assumption that (C) is true, can we come to a conclusion about whether or not houses are bigger than apartments based on it? Since we know that a house will always be bigger than an apartment (regardless of whatever situation we're in when (A) is true), there's nothing to worry about. There will always be a house that's bigger than all apartments, so (B) will never be true. Therefore, we cannot assert that assumption to hold true. While we may come to the conclusion that (C) is true (if we consider only the classical definition of \"bigger\"), we cannot assert it as a statement about the world we live in.\n\nWe can conclude that (C) is false. Thus:\n\n> The best English interpretation of the original proposition is \"Some large apartments are bigger than some houses.\"\n\n(D) Some houses are bigger than some large apartments.\n\n(D) (F \u2192 T)\n\nGiven what we've covered so far:\n\n```text\n  F \u2260 T        (Boolean \"false\" versus \"true\")\n  (F \u2228 T) \u2192 T (De Morgan's,asks for the truth table for classical logic)\n(A) (F \u2228 T) \u2192 T   \"Some large houses are bigger Than some apartments\"\n(B) (F \u2228 T) \u2192 T   \"Some Houses are bigger than states of all large apartments.\"\n(C) (F \u2228 T) \u2192 T   \"Some large apartments are bigger than non-space houses\"\n(D) (F \u2228 T) \u2192 T   \"Some Houses are greater than any apartment.\"\n```\n\nWe can make another assumption:\n\n```text\nF \u2192 T\n```\nFrom here, we can conclude:\n\n>\n```\nThe best English interpretation of the original proposition is \"Some large houses are bigger than some apartments.\"\n```\n\nThe parentheses around big are just my way of taking emphasis away from them.
