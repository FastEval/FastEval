Given the gradient, the cost docker is given by : \n\nC = loss(weights - g)\nWhere weights are the updated weights from the previous gradient descent update and g is the gradient of the loss function at the current weights.\n\nTherefore, the cost of one gradient descent update given the gradient is O(ND).\n\nD does not depend on N or D. O(ND) is therefore the cost of one gradient descent update.\n\nUnless otherwise specified or stated, I do not assume anything about the distribution of the input but always default to a uniform distribution. With this assumption, I can go through each line of the cost function.\n\nWe first see that with the reverse causal non corruption proof, we can broadcast the hidden states if the batch size is even. The backward pass then becomes:\n\nd/db = f(Wgemv(nu, E, z), b) - the derivative of f applied on the matrix algebra product of weights, input and bias.\nIn this case, we can show that this inner product is o(ND). Wgemv(nu, E, z) gives an o(ND) complexity as the matrix product is o(ND^2). E has a shape of o(ND^2). z is 1-dimensional. It has a shape of o(ND).\n\nThe142 softenedmax non- hadnian activation can be computed with the derivative:\n\nalpha' = softmax(beta')^T\nThe shape of softmax(beta') is then o(ND).\nThe output of the 142 activation is computed as the sum of these, o(ND). So, the cost of this step is o(ND).\n\nAfter this, the usual steps of performing a gradient descent apply. We pick the negative gradient with a learning rate of 1/N and update the weights.\n\nBefore this, given that wecitation had shown that f(x) = Wgemv( nu, E, z) and Softmax(a) = softmax(a)^T, it does not hold that the o(ND) for these kills the final o(ND) we obtained before. However, we can still bound it:\n\nWe can note that the cost of these two operations is of the form : o(2) and o(1) respectively\n\nTherefore, the total cost is still an o(ND).\n\nOverall, the cost of one gradient descent update is o(ND\u00b2).\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about the analysis or my understanding of the cost function.",

First, let's break down the Bayesian network into its components:\n- H: Parent node\n- U: Son nodes\n- P: mother node\n- W: daughter node\n2. We can start by focusing on the node that receives the most direct incoming edges: U. It has two son nodes (P and W), and has an outgoing edge to a daughter node (W). All three of these nodes have equal probability. (Note: We need to ignore the outgoing edge from U to W, since it's not relevant to the number of independent parameters needed.)\n  - Therefore, the number of independent parameters needed to specify the distribution over U = 2.\n\n3. Next, we need to account for the number of direct incoming edges to U. Since U has 2 son nodes (P and W), itcano and ozekens indices both equal 1. Therefore n = n0 + n1 = 2 + 1 = 3. Similarly, since U has an outgoing edge to a daughter node (W), we can add 1 more for a total of 3 parameters needed.\n\n4. Now we need to look at the other nodes. We can calculate the parameters needed to specify the distribution over each node by considering direct incoming edges, and ignoring single-edge-away outgoing edges (since they aren't useful). Therefore, P = 1, W = 2, H = 3.\n\n5. Putting it all together we have n=3, n0 = 0, and n1 = 2. Therefore 2 parameters. Parent nodes have only one parameter, while child nodes have two.
