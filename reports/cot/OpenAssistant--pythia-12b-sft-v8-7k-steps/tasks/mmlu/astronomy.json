            "question": "A comet of mass m impacts the earth (mass M radius R) at the minimum impact speed. What is the expression for the total energy released in the impact?\n\n(A) m*v\n(B) 0.5*m/(R^3)\n(C) 0.5*m*(2GM/R)\n(D) 0.6*G(M^2)/R",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Let's try to answer the following question step-by-step. \n\nI will provide each of the possible answers, as well as my reasoning behind why I think that's the correct answer. \n\n(A) m*v - The total energy released in an impact can be calculated as the change in kinetic energy. According to the information given, the comet has a mass of m and impact footprint consistent with that of the earth (mass M and radius R). The minimum impact speed can be calculated as v = (2M/R)^0.5. Substituting the masses, we have v = (2m^0.5/M^0.5 squashyness). Plugging this value of v into the kinetic energy formula, we get T = 0.5 * m * v^2 = 0.5 * m * (m * v^2) = 0.5 * m * (m * (M^2/R^2)) = 0.5 * m * (m * M^2) * R^2.\n\n(B) 0.5 * m / (R^3) - According to the expression above, we need to substitute in m*R^2 for T. Therefore, 0.5 * m / (R^3) = m * (R^2) = (m * M) * R^2. However, the minimum impact speed equation is given as v = (2M/R)^0.5. Plugging in the masses, we have v = (2(m^0.5)/M^0.5)^0.5, which simplifies to m^1/2. We have not utilized this simplification yet, but we can substitute this back into the kinetic energy formula: = 0.5 * m * (m * (M^2/R^2)) = 0.5 * m * (m * M^2) * R^2.\n\n(C) 0.5 * m * (2GM/R) - We can see from the kinetic energy formula that (2GM/R) is the change in gravitational potential energy. Therefore, the total energy released in an impact can be calculated as the sum of the two energy forms. For a comet with mass m, the gravitational potential energy is mgh, where h is the height above the surface of the earth at which the impact occurs. Setting h = R = 5 earth radii, we have: mgh = (2*5*10^30 kg * m^2 * R) * meters = 2*5*10^30 * m^2 * 5*10^9 * kg = 6*10^21 * m^2 * kg. Substituting this value into the kinetic energy formula, we get: = 0.5 * m * (m * (M^2/R^2)) = 0.5 * m * (m * 5*10^9 * kg * m^2 * 6*10^9 * m^2) = 0.5 * m * (m * 8*10^10 * kg * m^2).\n\n(D) 0.6 * G(M^2)/R - According to the expression above, we need to substitute in m*R^2 for T. Therefore, 0.6 * G(M^2)/R = 0.6 * (G * m^2)/R = (m * R^2)/R. Plugging in the total mass of the Earth, we have G*m^2*M^2 = (m123456*8*10^10^kg*m^2)*M^2 = 1*2*4*10^11^kg*m^2*M^2 = 2 *2*10^11^kg*m^2*M^2. Again, we have not utilized the simplification found earlier. However, we can substitute in the minimum impact speed equation, v = (2M/R)^0.5 and Math.sqrt(M*M) for one factor of M^2. Thus, 0.6 * (G * M^2)/R = 0.6 * (2*2*10^11^kg*m^2)/(2*10^11^kg*Math.sqrt(m^2)) = 0.6 * (2*1*10^12^kg*m^2)/(Math.sqrt(m^2*m^2)) = (m^2/(2*1*10^12 kg*m^2)) * (2*2*10^11^kg*m^2) = (3.16*10^21) * (m^2 * 3.6*10^14 * kg*m^4). Substituting all this into the kinetic energy formula, we get: = 0.6 * m *",

            "model_answer": "Most rocks on the Moon's surface are older than those on the Earth's surface. The best evidence for this is:\n\n(A) Lunar rocks are composed of fragments pulverized by many impacts.\n\nExplanation:\n\nLunar rocks have undergone many impacts over the millennia, as the Moon is constantly being bombarded by meteoroids. These impacts can pulverize the rocks into smaller particles, which would explain why most lunar rocks are older than those on Earth.\n\nHowever, not all lunar rocks are of similar age. The Moon has a heavily slope-sided mountain chain known as the Moon's maria, which are large impact craters filled with fresh rock. Since these craters haven't had enough time to accumulate scientific layers like other parts of the Moon, they are younger than the surrounding terrain.\n\n(B) Radioactive dating of lunar samples shows that they are older.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe radioactivity of lunar samples provides a way to estimate their age. If a lunar rock contains radioactive isotopes, their decay can be measured and used as a clock. By comparing the relative amounts of different radioactive isotopes, scientists can determine how long ago the rock formed.\n\n(C) The Moon's surface is more heavily eroded than the Earth's surface.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe Moon's surface is subject to a variety of natural processes, including winds, tides, and volcanic activity. Over time, these processes can remove parts of the lunar surface, creating erosion and impact craters. However, the Moon's surface is relatively protected from these processes compared to the Earth's surface, which is constantly bombarded by meteoroids and other forms of space dust.\n\n(D) The Moon's surface has more impact craters than the Earth's surface.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhile part (B) explains that lunar rocks are older due to impacts, this alone cannot explain why most rocks on the Moon's surface are older than those on the Earth's surface. Part (A) shows that Lunar rocks are composed of pulverized fragments from impacts, which implies that they are also more likely to be older rather than just having formed at a younger time in Earth's history. As for part (C), while the Moon's surface is more erosion-resistant, this alone does not lead to more impact craters. However, if we combine parts (A) and (C), we can see that the natural processes on the Moon have been more efficient at preserving the original lunar surface for the impacts to pulverize and create craters than the same processes on Earth.",
