            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(A) p = 4\n\nExplanation: \n\nIn the equation 24 = 2p, we can rearrange the terms to get p = 2x for some integer x. However, we cannot simply substitute x for p since it would result in an ambiguous equation.\n\nInstead, we can cross-multiply and simplify to get 4x = 24; dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 12. Therefore, the value of p in 24 = 2p is p = 12.\n\nAnswer: (A) p = 12",

We can spread the remaining $81.00 over as many soccer balls as possible, which suggests we can buy $8$ soccer balls with $90.00\n\nStep 2: if one soccer ball costs $15.60, what price do the last $81.00 need to reach in order to buy $8$ soccer balls?\nTo reach a price of $15.60 for every additional soccer ball, the remainder has to be enough to reach $15.60 multiplied by $8.00, or $120.00. This means the entire $81.00 could buy $8.00 soccer balls, or $8.00 / $15.60 = 5.33 soccer balls, which is not an available amount.\n\nStep 3: since each additional soccer ball costs $15.60, the team can buy at most $8$ soccer balls.

To do this, we'll set up and solve each equation that we have, and see which one gives us the value of t that we're looking for.\n\nFirst, we'll add the cost of the four tickets together: \n\n4t + 4t + 4t + 4t = 112 + 112 + 112 + 112 = 448  \n\nThis means that the cost of one ticket is the same as the total cost for four tickets. So the equation we need to solve is:\n\n4t = 448  \n\nTo solve for t, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 4:\n\nt = 448 / 4  \n\nSimplifying this expression gives us:\n\nt = 112  \n\nSo the cost of one ticket is approximately $28.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n(C) t over 4 = 112; $448",
