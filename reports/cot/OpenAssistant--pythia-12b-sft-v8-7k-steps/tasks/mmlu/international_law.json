So, the State that has jurisdiction over crimes committed on board such vessels in its own territory is the coastal State.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) The coastal State, which usually exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels.",

The UK Constitution includes a number of bills of rights, mainly the Magna Carta and the Human Rights Act. They do not provide the source of all the UK Constitution's power. The sovereign (the monarch or the queen) is the source of all the UK Constitution's power and administers it through ministers (such as ministers for foreign affairs and for\u0435\u043aNN\u043b\u043d\u0430\u043bsecurity). The queen's power is derived from the people and, consequently, is unlimited; she can make and unmake laws, and even do so without the assent of parliament.

            "model_answer": "(A) It means that only States are considered subjects of international law\n\nThe term \"international legal personality\" refers to a legal entity that has been recognized as having the capacity to be subject to and governed by international law. Only States are considered to be international legal persons under international law, and they alone have the legal capacity to create treaties, accede to treaties, and become subject to international law. International legal personality is required for an entity to become a subject of international law and be entitled to the rights and duties under international law.\n\n(B) It means having rights and duties under international law and a capacity to enforce these by or against the relevant actor\n\nAn entity that has international legal personality has the capacity to be subject to and governed by international law, including the right to take part in international legal proceedings and the ability to enforce its rights and duties through the international court system or by argument from either Party to the conflict before the International Court of Justice. International legal personality also grants the entity the ability to be subject to international law and to enforce international legal rights and duties through the relevant actor, which could refer to individual States or international organizations.\n\n(C) It means that an entity may challenge the authority of States\n\nAn entity that has international legal personality does not challenge the authority of individual States as subjects of international law per se, but rather may challenge the authority of a State or international organization that it believes is acting outside its treaty obligations or without due legitimacy. International legal personality does not grant the entity the right to invoke the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice or to engage in coercive action against a State.\n\n(D) It is a term that is meant to denote legal, as opposed, to physical persons under international law\n\nInternational legal personality is a legal construct, referring to the recognition of an entity as having the legal capacity to be subject to and governed by international law, including the ability to engage in international legal proceedings and to be subject to the authority of international courts.
