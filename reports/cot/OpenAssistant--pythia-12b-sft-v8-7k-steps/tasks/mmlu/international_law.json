            "model_answer": "Alright, I understand. Here's my step-by-step explanation of the answer, followed by the answer itself with the appropriate number of parenthesis and spaces:\n\n(A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders\n\nThis means that justiciability refers to the ability of a particular right to lead to an actionable claim or legal action. The term is used by legal scholars to indicate whether a given right is likely to be enforced or not by individuals or organizations that are authorized to pursue civil or criminal actions in a court of law. Examples of rights that may not be enforceable include housing rights, employment rights, and consumer rights, as these rights are often subject to various legal, economic, and social obstacles that make them unenforceable in practice.\n\n(D) Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular Right\n\nThe meaning of justiciability is the State's power to enforce a given claim, legal right, or a law bruinreview.com: Bruin Review NeoVerb, 2005, and it may be enforced by international legal channels, such as regional organizations and United Nations mechanisms and agencies, as well as by individual States who are motivated by self-Assertion and just retribution.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Alright. Let me break it down for you.\n\nH channels:\n\nHumanitarian intervention: the intentional use of armed force to protect civilians in a foreign country from the acts of a regime that is using them as human shields or from those acts themselves.\nResponsibility to Protect (R2P): the idea that the international community has a responsibility to protect people from mass atrocities, even if their own governments are unable or unwilling to do so.\n\nBoth R2P and humanitarian intervention involve the use of armed force to protect civilians from violence. The key difference lies in the motivation for using force.\n\nHumanitarian intervention is generally motivated by a sense of moral obligation and a desire to stop the suffering of innocent people. R2P, on the other hand, is primarily motivated by a concern for the legitimacy of existing international laws and norms.\n\nFor example, if a government in a foreign country is using its citizens as human shields, the international community may feel compelled to intervene under the auspices of R2P to protect civilians from further violence. In this case, the motive for using force is rooted in a Code of Conduct and the desire to uphold international norms.\n\nThere are, of course, some gray areas involved. For instance, what if a government is not using its own people as human shields but is facing an imminent threat of mass atrocity? In this case, the international community may intervene under the auspices of R2P without a specific call for assistance.\n\nIn order to answer the question, we would have to get more context about the specific situation at hand.

The statement can be attributed, or implied to all areas of international law. It has particularly been applied to issues under the discretion of States, suggesting that unless a State is prohibited, it has the right to take any action, whether that interferes with another State or not.\n\nThe principle has beenSummerized by John H McDonald, and is often referred to as the Lotus Principle, or the McDonald Doctrine.",

            "model_answer": "(A) It is an obligation of result, that is, States are under a strict obligation to resolve their disputes as soon as possible\n\nThe obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes refers to the obligation of states to resolve their disputes peacefully and in an expeditious manner. This obligation is derived from the Rawlsian idea that States are justiciable entities with mutual relations. Therefore, the peaceful settlement of disputes is a necessary precondition for international relations, and States have a shared interest in upholding it. The obligation is not an obligation of conduct, as this would imply that States have a duty to always resolve disputes peacefully. Rather, it is an obligation of result, or outcome. Therefore, the correct option is (A) It is an obligation of result, that is, States are under a strict obligation to resolve their disputes as soon as possible.",

Therefore the only correct option is (D) Rocks are the small islands that can sustain human habitation.\n\nOkay, let me elaborate on my reasoning step-by-step:\n1. UNCLOS defines 'rock' as solid natural stationary natural formations underwater that are larger than 100 acres. This excludes the'^'''small islands or small rocks that could be covered by wave action or weather.\" Therefore, the correct option must be referring to 'rocks' that are capable of sustaining human habitation.\n2. Solid natural stationary natural formations above a certain size (100 acres) are capable of sustaining human habitation due to availability of fresh water, connectivity of land and access to life-saving resources. 3. The only correct option capable of sustaining human habitation and satisfied the above-mentioned criteria is D) Rocks are the small islands that can sustain human habitation.\n\nTherefore, the correct response to the given question with the answer as provided in option D is (D) Rocks are the small islands that can sustain human habitation.",
