            "model_answer": "As I have not had any prior experience in public relations, only through common knowledge, let me give you my answer step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: What is public relations?\n\nIn my definition, public relations is all the activities that a company or individual does to shape the way public opinion towards them (whether positively or negatively).\n\nStep 2: The question\n\nWhich common public relations tactic involves sending journalists on visits to appropriate locations?\n\nLooking at the question I can see that we are dealing with a public relations tactic, and one of the options is actually media tour, where a journalist is taken on a tour of the company\u2019s facilities or the organization\u2019s headquarters in order to showcase it to the public.\n\nStep 3: Analysis of the other options\n\nThe other options are media release, press room, and promotional days/weeks, none of which involve sending journalists on tours to appropriate locations, which means that the only option left is media tour.\n\nTherefore my final answer is (A) Media release.\n\nHowever, you can still consider these options if you think I made a mistake in my reasoning.",

            "question": "You are the vice president of public relations for a corporation that produces a well-known brand of food products. In the Albany, New York, market, one of your products has recently been found to have some contamination. While apparently not fatal, it has given a large number of consumers severe stomach cramps and other intestinal problems. The cause has been traced back to your product, which is sold throughout the nation. Your CEO wants to know what you would advise to keep the situation from becoming a public relations disaster. What should you recommend?\n\n(A) Quickly investigate to make certain your product is definitely the cause of the illness.\n(B) Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product.\n(C) Stop sales of the product in the Albany, New York, market and issue a recall for that product.\n(D) Issue a press release to the Albany, New York, market explaining how to treat the symptoms.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\nThe corporation makes well-known food products. One of their products has been found to have contamination. This product is sold throughout the nation.\n\nThe CEO wants to know what the situation is and what should be done. They want to know what the VP of PR recommends. The VP of PR is offered four options: (A) quickly investigate, (B) stop sales throughout the nation and issue a recall for the product, (C) stop sales in the Albany, NY market and issue a recall for that product, and (D) issue a press release to the Albany, NY market about symptoms.\n\nThe VP of PR gives the CEO dozens of the best recommendations he's ever heard. His reasoning:\n\nThe vice president understands the importance of his position and wants to do a great job to make amends for the contamination, but he also wants to protect the corporation's reputation. As the VP, he knows that he has to make a decision fast. He remembers seeing the Grand Canyon once and knows that there is much more to see in New York. However, if the contamination has been found elsewhere, he will take the recommendations that the CEO listed. This also includes telling the CEO that there is nothing he needs to do in Albany.\n\nThe VP chooses (B) stop all sales throughout the nation and issue a recall for the product. Because the company wants to reduce the quantity of the product in circulation, the VP knows that the best way to do this quickly is to shut down sales of the contaminated products. In this way, people who already have the product will know they need to return it or exchange it for a free product. VIPs will also be happy that they did not forget to stop using the product and would not be sharing it with others.\n\nThe VP chooses (B) because it's the best recommendation for both the corporation's business and public's health. Though it will be important for the VP to investigate the contamination, theVP knows the contaminated product has been in the market for a long time. Instead of waiting for the investigation, in this way, the VP chooses the best idea that protects the corporation and those in need quickly.\n\nThe VP chooses (B) to protect both the corporation's reputation and its customers' health. She recommends that the public know how to treat the symptoms of these contamination. By making this recommendation, the VP hopes that this situation can be controlled before many people become sick. The VP also hopes that by expressing her concern and knowledge on the matter, the public will continue to trust her company and its products.",

Here is my step-by-step answer:\n\nWhy should a successful public relations counselor continually review present and future realities for an organization?\n\nA successful public relations counselor continually reviews present and future realities for an organization to fulfill two main purposes:\n\n1. To review the organization's current position with regards to public opinion, media coverage and stakeholder relations. This is important as it permits the counselor to understand the organization's image, how it is perceived by the wider public and what steps should be taken to improve this perception.\n\n2. To anticipate change. To do this effectively, the counselor will need to understand the organizations' past, present and future position and how that position is likely to change. Understanding the potential for change will permit the counselor to anticipate potential future problems before they arise and to develop strategies to mitigate risk and deal with change when it does occur.\n\n(A) to develop a vision statement\n\n(C) to interpret the organization's business plan\n\n(D) to consider the role public relations might play\n\nI will return with the answer shortly.

            "model_answer": "Sure! :)\n\nFirst, let's define the four categories of persuasive crisis communication strategies identified by W. Timothy Coombs.\n\nW. Timothy Coombs has identified the following four categories of persuasive crisis communication strategies:\n\nA ingratiation strategy, in which a company seeks to positively influence consumers' attitudes and opinions by offering favors, exposing them to a company\u2019s products and marketing, or providing financial rewards as a result of their ) experience with the company.\nB downplaying crisis, which occurs when a crisis is \u201cdownplayed\u201d or fails to receive as much attention as other events. This strategy seeks to downplay the significance of a crisis by focusing on less threatening topics and shelving long-term planning.\nC distancing, in which a company attributable to the crisis and uses this strategy to separate itself from the issue by creating a barrier between the company and the public. This includes exaggerating, ignoring, or denies the crisis and tries to distance itself from social responsibility.\nD none of the above, which states there aren\u2019t any persuasive crisis communication strategies identified by Coombs.\n\nNow, let's answer the question:\n\nWhich of the following is NOT one of the four categories of persuasive crisis communication strategies identified by W. Timothy Coombs?\n\nA ingratiation, B downplaying, C distancing, D none of the above.\n\nLet's look at each of the strategies and find out which option matches with them:\n\nA ingratiation: This strategy involves offering favors, exposing consumers to a company\u2019s products and marketing, or providing financial rewards to consumers as a result of their experience with the company (Coombs, 2002). Since we are asking about the strategy that is not present in this list, it means that A ingratiation is NOT one of the four categories of persuasive crisis communication strategies identified by Coombs.\nB downplaying: This strategy occurs when a crisis is \u201cdownplayed\u201d or fails to receive as much attention as other events (Coombs, 2002). Downplaying a crisis means discontinuing or delaying the permeanttimization of risks and responsibilities. Since we are asking about the strategy that is not present in this list, it means that B downplaying is NOT one of the four categories of persuasive crisis communication strategies identified by Coombs.\nC distancing: This strategy involves separating consumers from a crisis by creating a barrier between the company and the public (Coombs, 2002). C distancing means creating the appearance that a company is not responsible for, or cannot influence an event or crisis (Coombs, 2002). Since we are asking about the strategy that is not present in this list, it means that C distancing is NOT one of the four categories of persuasive crisis communication strategies identified by Coombs.\nD none of the above: This strategy means there are none of the four identified by Coombs (Coombs, 2002). Since none of the strategies in questions is present in this list, it means that none of the strategies in questions is NOT one of the four categories of persuasive crisis communication strategies identified by Coombs.\n\nIn summary, none of the strategies in questions have been identified by Coombs and therefore none of the strategies in questions are NOT one of the four categories of persuasive crisis communication strategies identified by W. Timothy Coombs.\nThe answer is none of the strategies in questions.",
