            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can follow that. Here is my step-by-step reasoning:\n\nLooking at the options, none of them are associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's. This is because there is no concrete evidence to suggest a decreased risk. Of course none of the options are a guaranteed increased risk either, but increasing age is the main risk factor. However, there is some evidence to suggest that intellectual activity and social interaction may decrease your risk. Increasing fish intake may also decrease your risk although if it isn't your cup of tea then avoid might be a better word. Conversely though, having a strategy for memory rehabilitation such as a mental active activity such as card or board games has been shown to decrease risk as well. The only factor listed here that has been shown to have any decrease in risk is marital status. Married people seem to have a lower risk factor of developing Alzheimer's.\n\nI am assuming that by \"decreased risk\", you mean a lower frequency in the population, which is a pretty common term. So I will output the following:\n(D) Being married\n\nSince none of the barriers listed above are insurmountable, I have very little reason to worry about it. Most should not worry about Alzheimer either. As always, major life events such as divorce and death will take a bigger toll on one's mental health than a retirement community.\n\nNow, that said. If you are spending time alone, feeling lonely, having trouble with decision-making and/or I should be worried too about/.\n\nPlease consult a doctor.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can explain my reasoning step-by-step and provide the answer below:\n\nThe first step is to identify the correct statement that corresponds with the perspective that development is embedded in history. As the question asks what is not true, it can be concluded that the perspective being described must be false.\n\n(A) Change can always occur regardless of age - This is the incorrect statement. Development is not permanent and unchanging. Yes, changes can occur, but they are not inherent or universal aspects of development. Instead, they are influenced by historical and cultural factors as well as various internal and external forces.\n\n(B) Sociocultural conditions must always be considered - This is not necessarily true. While cultural contexts can play a significant role in shaping development, they are not the sole determinant. Other factors such as economic, political, and technological contexts also shape Development.\n\n(C) Development in any particular areas (e.g., social) is tied to development in other areas (e.g., cognitive) - Correct statement. Development is interconnected and interdependent across various areas of the individual's life, including social (e.g., relationships, community engagement), cognitive (e.g., reasoning, problem-solving), and physical (e.g., health) areas. Each area contributes to the overall development of the individual.\n\n(D) Some characteristics change with age while others do not - Incorrect statement. All characteristics and aspects of development are dynamic and change over time. For example, the ability to learn and adapt may improve with age, while the ability to maintain stable relationships or engage in traditional customs may decline.\n\nAfter examining the possible perspectives on development that can be drawn from the embedded perspective, it is clear that (B) Sociocultural conditions must always be considered is the correct statement. This perspective emphasizes that societal, cultural, and political contexts have a profound impact on the various stages of human development, from childhood to adulthood, and throughout the life cycle.",
