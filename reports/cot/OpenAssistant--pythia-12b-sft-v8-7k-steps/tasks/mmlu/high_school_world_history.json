By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

During this period, global commerce played a vital role in the exchange of cultural ideas and goods. The Justinian plague in the 6th century and repeated Mongol invasions in the 13th century partially interrupted the Silk Road and forced many cultures to adapt to thei r local climate. The Renaissance was a period of great cultural diffusion in Europe, which was partially spurred by the abolishment of the Mongol empire and the temptation of trade with the resulting resource boom. Qouestion (C) is incorrect as the climatic optimum did not directly affect the development of gunpowder weapons, which were diffused from China through Chinese silk.

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . .

The events depicted could have affected only Koreans or they could have affected Americans as well.\n\nStep 3: It can be inferred from the passage that the events depicted were related to Koreans because they deal with what Colonel Bonesteel did to prevent the Soviets from taking over all of Korea when they were considering how to surrender to prevent the American troops from arriving in Korea. If this did not affect Koreans, then it is unlikely there would be an inference to it affect Koreans in the passage.\n\nStep 4: The events depicted may have affected Americans. Colonel Bonesteel was trying to prevent the American troops from arriving in Korea and thereforeffecting the lives of Americans that had placed their lives at risk to come help the Koreans.\n\nStep 5: However, the direct affect on Americans is not stated in the passage. Therefore, we cannot determine how it affected the lives of Americans.\n\nStep 6: Without being explicit in the passage, we cannot determine which affects the event depicted actually had on Koreans.

Captains of European ships were able to capture or purchase enslaved Africans from various parts of Africa and brought them to the West Indies and other European colonies where they were used as a labor force.\n\nThe close trading relationship between Sub-Saharan Africans and European powers was crucial to the slave trades and helped to sustain population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. European merchants provided African rulers with the firearms and other equipment necessary to consolidate their power, while African rulers provided European merchants with a market for their slaves.

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",

On justifying the massacre, it can be argued that according to the second passage, the massacre can be seen as a natural reaction to British colonial oppression in India.
