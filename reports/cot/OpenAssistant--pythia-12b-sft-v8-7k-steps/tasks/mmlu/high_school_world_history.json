            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nGunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China\nIn Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "I think this passage is most closely aligned to large-scale question (D) about the medieval climatic optimum affecting the process of cultural diffusion. This is because the passage discusses how the climatic conditions and the availability of resources in Western Europe in the 1200s through the 1400s affected the development and use of gunpowder weapons by Chinese rulers facing attack from nomadic tribes. It suggests that the presence of a warm and stable climate and abundant resources made it possible for Western European societies to develop and adopt new technologies, including the use of gunpowder weapons, that were not suitable for the Chinese opponents. On the other hand, the passage implies that the climatic conditions played a role in shaping the strategies and tactics of warfare in Europe, as governments sought to use new technologies to gain the advantage in sieges and competitive battles. By focusing on these specific aspects of the medieval climate, the passage tends to downplay other factors, such as political or economic ties, that might have influenced the diffusion of new technologies and warfare practices between Europe and China. In short, while the passage does not directly address the sharing of technology or military superiority, it provides insight into the ways in which the changing climate influenced the development of new technologies and warfare strategies in early modern Europe, particularly in Western Europe.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nBonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt. Paul C.

As you read it, Korea was divided into a northern part controlled by the Soviets, and a southern part controlled by the American and other forces. While Soviet forces had withdrawn, establishing the current KC piece of North Korea.\nAs the author describes, Jung Yak-yong, also known as angangang, usingGeorge Orwell's book \"1984\" said \"The three candidates for control of Korea under a decolonised American rule were the three imperialisms--America, Russia, and China--: America was out, Russia was in; and China would be in if Russia left, so that the Soviet Union would have a free hand in Manchuria\".\nSo given that option was not feasible and as the chances of war with the United States increases, he predicted that the war would eventually reach into, and the United States would regain control of, part of present day South Korea. However he also predicted that the balance of power would remain close with the coming of a \" bloc of division\" with the Soviet Union on one side with a \"bloc of division\" including America on the other, with a \"block of division\" with China opposing the first two.\n\nAs for the effect of the story on Koreans as a whole, that was more nuanced. There was initial support for  American efforts. However that enthusiasm in North Korea turned to optimism about the possibility that America would not re-establish control, and be replaced by a Chinese dominated North East Asian sphere of influence. However Jung was critical of American efforts, in part that they continued to display Korean forced into ajsond Allied occupation by the Soviets. But foremost that the division of Korea kept the potential for deterrence between North and South weak.",

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",
