            "question": "In a population of giraffes, an environmental change occurs that favors individuals that are tallest. As a result, more of the taller individuals are able to obtain nutrients and survive to pass along their genetic information. This is an example of\n\n(A) directional selection.\n(B) stabilizing selection.\n(C) sexual selection.\n(D) disruptive selection.",

            "model_answer": "The response to this question is (D) disruptive selection. I'll explain my reasoning:\n\nStep 1: The problem states that an environmental change has occurred in a population of giraffes that favors individuals who are tallest. This suggests that there may be a trait (e.g. height) being selected for.\n\nStep 2: The problem also mentions that tall giraffes are more likely to obtain nutrients and survive to pass on their genes. This suggests that the selected trait is probably influenced by fitness-related traits, such as survival and reproduction.\n\nStep 3: The three remaining options do not fit the above two suggestions. Directional selection requires repeating the same trait for a population. Stabilizing selection requires aestablish trait and not being modified by the environmental change. And sexual selection does not directly relate to traits being selected for.\n\nStep 4: The final option, disruptive selection, best explains the environment change described in the problem. Negative selective pressure occurs when there is a reduction in pirates in the population of pirates. Because pirates volunteer to become pirates, any genetic variants that increase the likelihood of graduating college are likely to be selected in. This is an example of disruptive selection.\n\nStep 5: The only remaining option that matches the disruptive selection in this question is option (D), disruptive selection. This solution explains the environmental change and how it influences a trait in a giraffe population.\n\nAnswer: (D) disruptive selection.",

            "question": "Which of the changes below following the start codon in an mRNA would most likely have the greatest deleterious effect?\n\n(A) a deletion of a single nucleotide\n(B) a deletion of a nucleotide triplet\n(C) a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the first codon position\n(D) a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the third codon position",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each option in turn:\n\nDeletion of a single nucleotide: it would mean that the mRNA would have a stop codon (UAG,UGA or UAA) placed at a position where no stop codon would normally occur. This would stop translation, leading to a non-functional protein. However, it would not have the greatest impact, as other options can lead to more dramatic changes.\nDeletion of a nucleotide triplet: it would mean a frame shift, meaning that the following amino acids would be read in a different frame, leading to aikoing protein. Deletions of larger numbers of nucleotides would be required, making this option less likely to occur.\nCodon-position substitution: it would mean that a mutation would occur in the portion of a mRNA that specifies the first amino acid in a protein, which would be less likely to have a great impact\nDeletion of a single nucleotide: it would mean a stop codon at a position where a stop codon would normally occur. This would stop translation, leading to a non-functional protein. However, it would not have the greatest impact, as other options can lead to more dramatic changes.\nDeletion of a single nucleotide: it would mean a stop codon at a position where a stop codon would normally occur. This would stop translation, leading to a non-functional protein. However, it would not have the greatest impact, as other options can lead to more dramatic changes.\nBefore deciding, we need to consider the context of the gene in question and how it functions in relation to other genes, and their overall impact on the organism as a whole. In this case, the gene in question is likely to play some kind of important role in the organism. Since the further damage caused by stopping translation is permanent, D is correct. However, given enough time, the organism could recover from a lot of damage, so B could also be correct. But if the organism has no time to recover due to a sudden environmental challenge, the choice is clear: C so that the organism can adapt to the sudden environmental change.",

Introduction: In a hypothetical environment, fishes called pike-cichlids are visual predators of algae-eating fish (i.e., they locate their prey by sight).\n2. Background:\n    - Pike-cichlids are visual predators that use sight to locate their prey.\n    - They can target algae-eating fish, which are also visual predators that target algae.\n3. Hypothesis: If a population of algae-eaters experiences predation pressure from pike-cichlids, which of the following should least likely be observed in the algae-eater population over the course of many generations?\n\nD. Selection for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes\n6. Analysis:\n    - In the presence of pike-cichlids, algae-eating fish are expected to become more vigilant and effective hunters, which could increase their chances of escaping predation.\n    - This would lead to a perceived benefit of escaping predation, which would select for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes.\n    - Therefore, least likely to be observed over many generations is selection for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at larger overall body sizes, which might not offer a survival advantage in the presence of pike-cichlids.\n    - As such, the only remaining option would be (C) selection for larger female algae-eaters, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young.\n    - This option, while still a possibility, is less likely to occur due to the costs involved in bearing larger and larger broods.\n    - Therefore, Option (D) Selection for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes is the best option considering the hypothetical environment and the predation pressure from pike-cichlids.\n    - The answer is (D) Selection for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes.",
