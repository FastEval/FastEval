            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following memoir.\nNot only did he expect all persons of distinction to be in continual attendance at Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of those of inferior degree; at his lever, his couches, his meals, in the gardens of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers in general were allowed to follow him), he used to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped him[;] he saw everybody. If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.",

Based on the information, it seems that the duke, who was a member of the French nobility, is biased against King Louis XIV.\n\nOne possible explanation for this bias is that the duke is a prominent member of the French aristocracy, and as such, he may have had certain expectations and priorities that were not met by King Louis's policies. Additionally, the duke's household and interactions with the king were closely monitored by Louis XIV's administration, which may have led to any dissatisfaction or opposition being noticed and punished.\n\nTherefore, while option (A) and (D) could also be explanations for the bias, they do not provide clear evidence that supports them compared to the other options.\n\nTo sum up, the best explanation for the bias found in the document is (B) - the duke is biased against King Louis XIV because of his suppression of the aristocracy. This explanation is supported by King Louis XIV's policies, which aimed to consolidate power and centralize control, which could have clashed with the duke's expectations and interests as a member of the aristocracy.",

When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.
