We know that Elizabeth woke up at 6am, Sarah saw her near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 8am to 9am, Jessica saw her at the gym from 9am to 3pm, Betty saw her at the theater from 3pm to 7pm, and James saw her at a yoga studio from 7pm to 8pm.\n\nThe amusement park was closed after 8pm. We need to find out between what times Elizabeth could have gone there. Since we know that Elizabeth was at the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the gym, the theater, and the yoga studio, it means she was present at those locations for at least some of the time between 8am and 8pm (her waking time). That means that between those two periods, Elizabeth could have gone to the amusement park.\n\nHowever, we cannot assume that Elizabeth went straight to the amusement park from her waking time to the closing time and did not go to any other location in between. So, we need to find a time when Elizabeth was not present in the places listed. We know that Sarah watched her near the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Jessica saw her at the gym, Betty saw her at the theater, and James saw her at the yoga studio. Those are all locations except the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the gym, the theater, and the yoga studio. So, we can eliminate those locations as possible places Elizabeth could have gone to.\n\nTherefore, the only possible answer is (A) 8am to 9am.",

(B)\n        Jason saw Leslie waiting at the airport from 11am to 6pm. (C)\n        David saw Leslie attending class at the school from 6pm to 10pm. (D)\n\nNext, we can combine the times as shown below:\n\n        Leslie woke up at 5am          (A)\n        Richard saw Leslie buying a phone at the electronics store from 5am to 7am. (B)\n        Jason saw Leslie waiting at the airport from 11am to 6pm. (C)\n        David saw Leslie attending class at the school from 6pm to 10pm.\n\nNow, we need to find the times that Leslie could have gone to the clothing store. We can subtract the time Leslie spent at each place from the list of combining times:\n\n        Leslie waited at the airport from 6pm to 10pm     (D)\n        Leslie went to the clothing store                (C)\n\nTherefore, the time Leslie could have gone to the clothing store is:\n\n        Leslie waited at the airport from 6pm to 10pm\n\nThe answer in the form of a hint is:\n\n        S",

If they went immediately, between 0 and 5\nb. If they spent half an hour walking, between 5 and 10\nc. If they spent half an hour driving, between 10 and 15\n2. Jason saw Ashley buying lunch at the deli between 11am and 1pm, Ashley could have gone to the bookstore immediately after that or spent about 1 hour driving\n3. Emily saw Ashley driving to the water park between 1pm and 3pm, she can't tell the exact time, so let's calculate the time Ashley could have been at the bookstore:\n subtract the time Ashley spent driving, 1h, from the total time: 5 hours\n between 3pm and 5pm is the only logical possibility, so let's investigate it:\n if Ashley went to the bookstore immediately, they would be back for Emily by 7:30pm\n if Ashley spend 1 hour driving, they would still be back for Emily by 6:30pm\n if Ashley spent 2h, they would still be back for Emily by 5:30pm\n so the only solution is the option (B): 11am to 1pm, between 1 and 2: 30 minutes is the only possible times Ashley could have been at the deli to buy lunch\n4. Kimberly saw Ashley stretching at a yoga studio between 3pm and 6pm, they can go to the deli before that, so we check:\n if Ashley went to the deli immediately after stretching, they would be back for Kimberly by 6:30pm\n otherwise, between 4:30 and 5:30pm (30 minutes), they could go to the deli, come back, and still be able to drive straight to the water park\n between 5:30 and 6pm (30 minutes) is ruled out because they couldn't pour water",
