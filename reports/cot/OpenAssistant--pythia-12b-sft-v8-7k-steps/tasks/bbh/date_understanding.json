Therefore, 1 year after that date, we find it to be on Mar 20th, 2021.\n\nWe can simplify this question by instead asking for the date in (DD/MM/YYYY). We can use Tuesday, 20th March, 2020 as our reference date. [Correction as pointed out by the comments, Jane quit on Mar 20th]  Since Tuesday, 20th March, 2020 is the first day of the year, we can say that 1 year after that date will be on Tuesday, 20th March, 2020.\n\nWe can also calculate the yeardifference directly:\nOne year after Thursday, 13th March, 2020 is Friday, 14th March, 2020.\nSo the date in DD/MM/YYYY one year after Thursday, 13th March, 2020 would be (D/M/Y)/(13/3/2020) = (29/13/2020) = 20/02/2021 or in theGiven string (D/M/Y), ((20/02/2021) = Thursday, 20th February and Friday, 21st of February 2021.\n\nLet\u2019s proove it:\nTen days before Friday, 14th March, 2020 is Wednesday, 13th March, 2020.
