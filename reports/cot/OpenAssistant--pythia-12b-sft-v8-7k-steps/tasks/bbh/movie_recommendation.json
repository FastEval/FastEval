The film \"Schindler's List\" and, to a slightly lesser extent, \"The Silence of the Lambs\", have \" educational\" themes about the Holocaust and murder mysteries, respectively, that Orlando does not have. Similarly, \"Guilty of Romance\" and \"Tombstone\" both depict debauchery, whereas \"Forrest Gump\" deals with pure, naive love that is closer to the target movie \"The Silence of the Lambs\".\n\nStep 5: Braveheart has an \"naive\" theme of sorts.
