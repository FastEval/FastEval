However, in this case, the sentence \"(A) You are mistaken when you say that he should have just let them get away for assaulting him\" has a sarcastic tone.\n\nThe use of the word \"mistaken\" suggests that the statement is not meant to be taken literally. It is adegruoted from a hypothetical situation where a person is mistaken for thinking that assaulting someone is justifiable.\n\nThus, the sarcastic tone is the use of \"(A) You are mistaken\" which implies that the speaker knows that the statement is not true.

Ask anybody: If you can ask several people separately and get different answers, it's likely that the statement is sarcastic and the different responses are playground humor.\n\n3.

This statement is likely sarcastic.\n- Works at a McDonald's has made me an amazing chef: Factors 1-3 above suggest this is likely sarcastic as well, given the nature of the speaker and their actions.\n\nTherefore, the most likely option is that this statement is sarcastic.",

In this case, the statement starts with thean expression of admiration for the person's abilities and strengths in a sober state, and then Jestically contrasting it with his or her idiocy when he is drunk. This suggests that the speaker is not being entirely serious in their praise and is attempting to mock or belittle the person in some way.\n\nStep 2: From the same language used previously, I inferred that the speaker's intention is to criticize the person's potential for establishing healthy relationships when they are under the influence.\n\nStep 3: To determine the literal meaning of the language more precisely, I checked the cultural and socio-political climate of the time period to which the sentence is attributed.\n\nStep 4: With the time period already determined, I would check to see which political pundits common in said time would clearly be sarcastic, as they would know better, however they would sarcastically praise this described person.\n\nStep 5: After these steps, it is clear that statement (A) is satirical.\n\nStep 6: Families choose a dating partner carefully. He is not suitable for compatibility, family background, occupation, tastes, social position; therefore he chooses a woman like her.\n\nStep 7: Family selection clearly. probably families choose the woman, who is with the good material. Let's call her A.\n\nStep 8: That not drunk, but lived with good companion with A. Therefore tries A, until she is no longer attractive.

Not a bad one...\n\nStatement (B) is not sarcastic, because it does not mention any critical intention towards Drunk Dating, but rather is a compliment to the persons capacity to find a partner if they find themselves alone and without means.\n\nStep 10: While statement (B) is not the most perceive that drunk dating is nor, enjoyable. It does notruce way for many more serious dating partners for those who purely want to get married. While statement (B) is a well thought out, well explained thesis that, even if slightly exaggerated has several parts that I like and want to preserve.\n\nStep 11: Therefore, (B) is not sarcastic",

This is because the statement is presenting the illegal action as achievable but only as long as you are aware that it is illegal. Therefore, it is a sarcastic statement.",

            "correct_answer": "(B)",
            "model_answer": "(A) You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the elephants, that woefully endangered species\n\nExplanation:\nWhen we say sarcastic things, they often have the opposite meaning compared to what we actually mean. So, option (A) sounds like a sincere expression of gratitude, but there is a bit of sarcasm conveyed in the words \"you're welcome my dear friend.\" \"Elephants\" could also be a pun on the name of the infamous African browser GNOME, elephant, a pun which would also further increase the sarcasm in the doublespeak.\n\n(B) You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the trolls, that woefully endangered species\n\nExplanation:\nThe word \"trolls\" is a term used to describe internet users known for their provocative and controversial behavior. This phrase does not have the sarcastic tone that option (A) has. Instead, it implies a more friendly nod to the person being thanked. This idiom falls under the category of \"compliment 101\" and would not be considered sarcastic.\n\nAnswer: (A)\n\nThe answer with the word \"sarcastic\" in it is: (A) and the answer without the word \"sarcastic\" is: (B).\n\n(Note: in real life, one would need to clarify the number of elephants that the person is feeding, as well as what they are feeding them with.)",

            "model_answer": "() Statement A is not sarcastic. Statement B which is \"Without the river there's no water and no electricity. Blocking it is such a terrible move!\" is sarcastic.\n\nExplanation:\nThe statement \"Blocking it is such a smart move!\" is a sarcastic exaggerated quote to convey a meaning opposite to the speaker which is to say it is such a bad idea to block a river. Specifically it implies that blocking a river to service a building is definitely a bad idea and people that suggest the contrary want to make you waste a lot of money and are representing a viewpoint which is lacking common sense.",

            "model_answer": "(A) That's only about $0.15 per mile for a van, perfectly reasonable fuel costs \n\nTo determine if A is sarcastic, we need to consider the context in which it was said. If A were genuinely accurate and not sarcastic, there would be no reason to not include the cost of the fuel as a separate line item with a much higher cost per mile. The context in which A was said suggests that it is sarcastic. That's because the impression is given that the providing of this realistic, low cost fuel for the van is an exaggeration, aexample of a speaker being dishonest with some ulterior motive. Similarly, the mention of a \"Reasonable\" cost serves to highlight that it is not reasonable. Given the impression that A is sarcastic, it seems more likely that it is sarcastic.",
