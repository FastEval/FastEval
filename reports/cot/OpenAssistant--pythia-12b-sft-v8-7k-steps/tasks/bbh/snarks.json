I will proceed to answer step-by-step:\n\n(A) He's a generous person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need:\nIn this statement, the word \"generous\" implies that the person being referred to is giving something away, specifically their time and money, which can be perceived as selfish given the nature of the charity stream. However, the fact that they are \"trying to promote\" such a stream suggests that they themselves believe in its legitimacy and relevance. Hence, there is a hint of sarcasm in this statement, as it's likely that the person being referred to is not as generous as they seem.\n(B) He's a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need:\nIn this statement, the word \"terrible\" implies that the person being referred to is doing something awful, specifically promoting an illegitimate charity stream. However, the fact that they are \"trying to promote\" such a stream suggests that they themselves believe in its legitimacy and relevance. Hence, there is a hint of sarcasm in this statement, as it's likely that the person being referred to is not as terrible as they seem.\n\nHence, the answer as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else is: (B).",

Saying this statement would mean that she does not accept depression as an illness or as a permanent state of mind.\nSo this answer is very unlikely to be correct.\n\n(B) Hey just be happy that you won't be depressed anymore : \nThe statement here is ironic, as the reality is depressed people do not need to be told to be happy. A person who is depressed already knows how to 'be happy' (this is a very stretched and exaggerated claim). She would rather prefer people not tell people who are depressed that they will not be depressed anymore. This statement is meant to belittle what depression truly constitutes as an illness.\n\nIn conclusion, option A is less sarcastic.\n\n---\n\nA = (N)\n\nBut if you think the second statement is involves more sarcasm, you should point it out and I will give my best guess.",

Statement (A): Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it okay\nWhat does this statement mean? It means that being racist is a casual, lighthearted hobby and yet it is still socially acceptable and thus \"okay.\" This statement seems to suggest that racism is not a serious or harmful issue in modern society.\n\n2. Statement (B): Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it toxic\nWhat does this statement mean? It means that being racist is not only toxic but also serious and harmful. It suggests that racism is a dangerous and divisive force that needs to be addressed and eliminated.\n\nNow let's consider each option and evaluate them based on the given criteria:\n('Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it okay')\n\n1. Statement (A): This option suggests that racism is not a serious issue and is insteada harmless hobby. Since racism is widely considered to be a serious issue, this option is not a good fit.\n2. Statement (B): This option suggests that racism is not only harmful but also serious and harmful. Since racism is widely considered to be a serious issue, this option is a good fit.\n\nBased on the given criteria, I believe Statement (B) is the better option.

            "model_answer": "Certainly.  Let's start with the following introduction:\n\nQ: Can you help me with a sarcastic riddle?\n\nStep 1: Understanding the context of the riddle\nThe riddle presents the choice between two options: (A) Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build carriages instead, and (B) Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build lightrail instead.\n\nStep 2: Identifying the tone and context of the riddle\nAs the riddle is presented as if it is a statement realized by a character, the tone and context are most likely humorous or ironic. A sarcastic riddle aims to convey a clear meaning whilst preserving the overall absurdity and nonsensical nature of the statement.\n\nStep 3: Analyzing each option and determining if it is sarcastic\nBoth options generate the same impression, namely, a reluctance to change and a preference for established, but possibly faulty or inefficient, means of transportation.  Since it is unreasonable to expect significant transportation innovation or discontinuation, option (A) employing a new and distinct means of transport (carriages) is more plausible. Therefore, the most likely interpretation of this option is that\u2014while tacitly acknowledging the existence of trams\u2014it suggests an alternative mode of transportation that avoids tramules.\n\nStep 4: Calculating the probability of either option\nDividing both options equally, it is likely that neither means of transportation would be deemed suitable, as both seem equally inefficient. Perhaps the answer is not any of the two options; it could well be the same as the character's opinion or, more generally, the subject of the riddle.\n\nStep 5: Formulating an answer and presenting it\nBased on the context and the conveyed tone, therefore, the most probable answer to the sarcastic riddle \"Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build carriages instead\" is (A): Yeah.\n\nThe answer is (A), followed by a final pause (Italics asAnswers).\n\nThe reasoning utilized in the answer involved understanding and evaluating the substance of both options, settled on the most plausible interpretation, and calculated the probability  of both292/spacePrograms ending to be equal.\n\nThe answer is summarised as a single letter.\n\nPublisher or  Italics asAnswers): Yeah.",

The phrase \u201con their terms\u201d is commonly associated with a direct, straightforward approach, while the placement of \u201con your terms\u201d indicates that the speaker expects the target to change their own style.\nStep 5: Therefore, option (A) is sarcastic in that it is ironic, and its mechanism involves the speaker directly contradicting the expectedcy outcome.\nStep 6: The sarcastic nature of the statement allows for multiple interpretations, both of which end in the same outcome. In one sense, the sarcastic meaning could be socially rejecting the idea of surrendering to higher odds. It could also suggest that the goal is to win through unconventional methods rather than blatant superiority. Therefore, these interpretations fall in the range -1 to -2 in terms of sarcasm.\nStep 7: Therefore, option (A) is a statement which conveys the sarcastic meaning of a direct contradiction.
