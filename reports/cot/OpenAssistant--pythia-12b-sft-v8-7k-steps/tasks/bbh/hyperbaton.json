In tougue-modifying compounds in English, the adverb tends to come before the adjective in the compound, so this order is possible.\nHowever, since the adjective grey is modified by the adjective good, it is the good which governs the understood meaning of grey, and not the other way around. Therefore this sentence is incorrect.\nBy the same analysis, the following orders are also unacceptable:\n(A3) Grey Indian good pyramidal cloth computer\n(A4) Good Indian grey pyramidal cloth computer\n\nTherefore only order (A1) remains. The correct answer is:\n\n(A1) Good pyramidal grey Indian cloth computer\n\nIf you want to express the question directly in logical notation you can use the following implications:\n(A1) `good < grey` `pyramidal cloth Indian` `computer`\n(A2) `good < grey` `grey < Indian` `cloth computer`\n\nThus, only (A1) is acceptable.\n\nYou can also use this notation to rigorously derive the answer. Here's how:\nProverbial wisdom from married linguistics: If something sounds correct, it probably is!\n\nFirst of all, some words can be substituted for other words without changing the meaning.\nFor example in grey, one the adjective used for Magenta, while in computer, one can substitute one of the substitution register for GeneralPurposeRegister.\n\nLooking at the facts, both (A1) and (A2) is manageable. However, pros are insistend on using good.\n\nTherefore (A1) is more suitable.\nYou can check the answer below:\n\nGood pyramidal grey Indian cloth computer",

In this case, the adjective is describing the \" tiny\" Eygptian typing \"square\". This is a positive quality; it is not bad or unpleasant. Putting \"terrible\" first, before the noun phrase, is the correct way to write these words in this order. \nOption B:\n\n\"new\" comes before \"tiny\" because the wieder new refers to the adjective \"terrible\", in this case a negative feature.

Therefore, it is not the subject.\n normal: ( normal ) means \"normal\" / \"normal-sized\"\n size: ( size ) means \"size\"\n paper: ( paper ) means \"paper\"\n white: ( white ) means \"white\"\n good: ( good ) means \"good\"\n\nStep 3: Identify possible adjective order\n\nAccording to the given sentences, the only applicable adjective is \"normal-size\". So, we need to determine the correct order for this adjective.

            "correct_answer": "(A)",
            "model_answer": "(A) enormous yellow Egyptian driving computer.\n\nExplanation:\nTo determine whether the adjective order in the two options is correct, we need to consider groups of words that act as units (also called noun phrases or phrases of predication). For option (A), the appropriate group is \"enormous yellow Egyptian driving computer\". Because \"enormous\" and \"yellow\"\u00e4rdes near one another and act as a single noun phrase, the correct adjective order should be \"yellow enormously\".\n\nFor option (B), the appropriate group is \"driving yellow enormous Egyptian computer\". Here, \"driving\" is a combined adjective/noun, as it groups with \"yellow\" to make a single noun phrase \"driving yellow\". However, \"driving\" still has to be the more upstream adjective because it groups with \"enormous\" instead, making another noun phrase \"enormous yellow\". Consistent with the correct order, we then place \"yellow\" as the final adjective. So the correct order is yellow enormously.\n\nGiven the correct adjective order is yellow enormously, the phrase \"yellow enormous Egyptian computer\" makes no sense because yellow is an adjective and \"egyptian\" is a noun that means \"pertaining to Egypt\" or \"of or characteristic of Egypt\". Without more context, it is impossible to determine what the correct meaning of a sentence with these words is, so neither option A nor option B is completely unacceptable but only Except as an Attested noun. We cannot prove which of the two alternatives is the correct one, but given the context it is more likely that yellow is a prior adjective and \"(C) huge Egyptian yellow driving computer\" would be more realistic.",

            "model_answer": "The midsize tan computer has the correct adjective order of \"silly tan midsize computer\". My reasoning is as follows:\nThe adjective \"silly\" is used to describe the computer, and because it is followed by the word \"midsize\", it is clear that the computer is described in a positive or neutral way. The adjective \"tan\" is used to describe the computer, and because it is followed by \"midsize\", it also conveys a meaning of positivity. Therefore, the sentence should describe a computer that is both silly and tan, which leads to the correct conclusion that the computer is midsize.",

Therefore the final answer is the correct option. \"Ridiculous\" is an adjective from the list. The correct order of colors is green, blue, red and black. Green is followed by blue and red. Black is an outline color and not a list of adjectives. Therefore the weakest color is grey. There are no other options. Therefore the final answer is (G).",
