We are given two statements: the peaches are more expensive than the apples, and the mangoes are the cheapest. To satisfy these statements, we can conclude that:\n\n- If the peaches were the second-most expensive, then we would have W > V, which contradicts the assumption (A). Therefore, the second-most expensive fruit must be the apples.\n- If the mangoes were the cheapest fruit, then we would have W = V-B, where B is the price of the mangoes. Substituting the given value of B, we get W = V-B = (V-3). However, this contradicts the initial assumption that the fruit stand sells peaches for the most expensive fruit. Therefore, the mangoes are not the cheapest fruit.\n\nStep 3.
