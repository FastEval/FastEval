            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that!\n\nStep 1: Ensure the statements are logically consistent within each paragraph\nThe statements are consistent. If Mel finishes above Ada, then Ada must finish below Mel. Similarly, if Mya finishes below Ada, Ada must finish above Mya. This gives us three equal possibilities:\n(A) Ada finished last\n(B) Mel finished last\n(C) Mya finished last\n\nStep 2: Assign a letter to each possibility\nWe can't say anything about the order of finishing without more information. So we can't know the order until someone finishes. We can't determine the order only based on the descriptions alone, so we need to know someone has finished.\nStep 3: considered Ada, Mel, and Mya\nWe know Mel finished above Ada and Mya finished below Ada. Therefore, either Ada finished above Mel and below Mya, or Mya finished below Mel and above Ada. But we can't determine the order between Ada and Mya, since we don't know for sure if either finished before the other.\nStep 4: All letter possibilities must be considered.\nSo let's consider letter possibilities:\n(A) Ada finished last\n(B) Mel finished last\n(C) Mya finished last\n\nStep 5: Determine the answer\nStep 2 and 4 tell us we can't determine the order until someone finishes, so we must know the order before the person finishes. Therefore, we can't assign letters to the order before someone finishes. And we can't determine the order based on the descriptions alone.\nStep 6: All possible order 4\nWe can write out all possible orders ofAda, Mya, and Mel, which are (A), (B), (A), (C), (B), (A), (C), (A), (B), (C).\nThese give us nine total order possibilities, since we have 3 objects and 4 possible orderings.\nStep 7: Determine most likely order\nSince it's a golf tournament, we can assume it's a stroke play format. If this is true, then we can determine the likely order by comparing each possibility to one another.\nStep 8: Compare orderings\nAda finished first and then Mya and Mel, order (A):\n* Ada finished first and Mel finished second (a<b): nope, Ada finished first means Ada finished last\n* Ada finished first and Mel finished last (a<b): nope, Ada finished last means Ada finished first\nAda finished last (a>b): nope, Ada finished first means Ada finished last\n* Ada finished last (a>b): Ada finished last\nMel finished second and then Mya and Ada: order (B):\n* Mel finished second and Ada finished first (a<b): Mel finished first and Ada finished second (b<a) is true\n* Mel finished second and Ada finished last (a<b): Ada finished last\n* Mel finished second and Ada finished first (a>b): Ada finished first\nStep 9: Summary\nThat's why the most likely outcome is Ada finished last. Either way (A), (B), or (C) is a possibility based on the given statements alone.\n\nAnswer: (A) Ada finished last.",
