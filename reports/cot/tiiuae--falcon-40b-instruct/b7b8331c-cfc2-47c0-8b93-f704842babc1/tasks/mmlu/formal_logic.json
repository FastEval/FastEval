            "model_answer": "I will now explain my reasoning step-by-step.\n\n1. The given sentence states that a person is considered to have lived with you for all of the present year if the person was born or died in the present year and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive.\n\n2. To symbolize this sentence in PL, we need to use the following variables:\n\n- B: the person was born in the present year\n- D: the person died in the present year\n- H: your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive\n- L: the person lived with you for all of the present year\n\n3. We can use the following formulas to represent the given sentence:\n\n- B \u2228 D: the person was born or died in the present year\n- L \u2283 B \u2228 D: if the person lived with you for all of the present year, then the person was born or died in the present year\n- L \u2283 H: if the person lived with you for all of the present year, then your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive\n\n4. We can combine the above formulas to get the final formula:\n\n- (B \u2228 D) \u2022 H \u2283 L: if the person was born or died in the present year and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive, then the person lived with you for all of the present year\n\n5. Therefore, the best symbolization of the given sentence in PL is:\n\n- (B \u2228 D) \u2022 H \u2283 L\n\n6. The final line should contain the answer as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else. The answer is:\n\n- (B \u2228 D) \u2022 H \u2283 L",
