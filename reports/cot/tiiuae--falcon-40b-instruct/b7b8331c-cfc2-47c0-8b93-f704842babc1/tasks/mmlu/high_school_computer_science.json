It is an essential part of software development and maintenance. It helps programmers understand the program's purpose, functionality, and structure. It also helps other programmers who may work on the program in the future.\n\nProgram documentation should be updated whenever changes are made to the program. This is because changes to the program may affect its functionality, structure, or purpose. Therefore, it is essential to keep the documentation up-to-date to ensure that it accurately reflects the current state of the program.\n\nProgram documentation is useful during initial program development and also when modifications are made to existing programs.
