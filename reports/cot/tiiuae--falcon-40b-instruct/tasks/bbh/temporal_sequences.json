Here's why:\n\nFrom the provided information, we know that Jason could have gone to the movies before 10am, but that doesn't seem very likely. It's unlikely because most theaters open at around 10am or 11am.

However, we also know that Jennifer saw Jason walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 6pm to 7pm. Therefore, we can infer that Jason didn't go to the movies during that time, either.\n\nSince Jennifer saw Jason walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 6pm to 7pm, we can infer that he didn't go to the movies before then.

Similarly, Betty saw Sarah driving for only an hour between 2pm and 3pm, which could potentially mean that she was only out for that amount of time. We can assume that it only took her a few minutes to buy the cookies and return to her car. Additionally, as it would not fit well with the timeline, we can assume that she spent no more than an hour at the mall.

Samantha also saw him at the electronic store but was unable to see him buying the phone. Thus, we can infer that Andrew arrived at the store around 9am or 10am. \n\nMoreover, Richard saw Andrew buying the phone between 8am and 10am which could be a possibility as Samantha saw Andrew at the store from 10am to 2pm. Therefore, Andrew is certainly available between those times which could be a possibility as Michael saw Andrew reading at the library which suggests that Andrew could have been at the art studio.\n\nOn the other hand, there could be another interpretation that Andrew could have been at the art studio at 4pm to 6pm as Michael saw him at the library from 3pm to 4pm which is before Sarah saw Andrew buying lunch from 4pm to 6pm. So, Andrew could have gone to the art studio but was unable to see him partly due to the time zone differences.\n\nGiven this information, there could be three possible outcomes. Andrew is certainly available between 8am and 10am as Samantha saw Andrew at the store from 10am to 2pm. Andrew could have been at the art studio between those times which could be a possibility as Michael saw Andrew reading at the library which suggests that Andrew could have been at the art studio. Or it could be that Andrew was at the art studio between 4pm to 6pm as Michael saw him at the library from 3pm to 4pm which is before Sarah saw Andrew buying lunch from 4pm to 6pm.\n\nBased on the given information and possible outcomes, we can infer that Andrew could have gone to the art studio between 8am to 10am which is the most likely possibility.
