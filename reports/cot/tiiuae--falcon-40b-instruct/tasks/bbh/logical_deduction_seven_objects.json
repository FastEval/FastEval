Paragraph B is logical because if the truck is the oldest, and the tractor is the fourth-newest, then the minivan must be older than the truck. Also, because the statements all refer to one object, we can assume that they are talking about the same vehicle.\n<br><br>Finally, we can eliminate Paragraph D because the same reasoning used in Paragraphs B and E eliminate this paragraph. If the minivan is older than the truck, and all vehicles are in the same order, then the minivan cannot be the oldest.\n<br><br>So, we have eliminated three options: A, D and E. That means that the oldest vehicle may be the limousine, the tractor, the hatchback or the bus. Let's look at statements that may help us choose one of these options. \n<br><br>The minivan may be older than the truck, but it cannot be older than the limousine or the tractor. Therefore, the minivan cannot be the oldest or the second oldest vehicle.\n<br><br>It was stated that the hatchback is older than the bus. Therefore, the bus cannot be the oldest vehicle because it is newer than the hatchback.\n<br><br>The tractor cannot be the oldest vehicle because the statements says the convertible is older than the tractor. Therefore, we can cross out decisions C. Finally, if D is the oldest vehicle, all other statements in the statements are logically impossible, so we can eliminate it.\n<br><br>The minivan cannot be the oldest because it is too new. The statements all refer to one object, so we can assume they are talking about the same vehicle. Therefore, D is the oldest vehicle.\n<br><br>Extra: Is there a way to get rid of three more options all at once in the statements?</s> \nYes!

The green book cannot be the leftmost book if it is to the left of the white book because the white book is to the left of a few other books.

In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a truck, a hatchback, a minivan, a bus, a tractor, a station wagon, and a convertible. The station wagon is the fourth-newest. The minivan is the third-newest. The tractor is the second-oldest. The convertible is older than the station wagon. The truck is newer than the bus. The hatchback is older than the convertible.\nOptions:\n(A) The truck is the third-oldest\n(B) The hatchback is the third-oldest\n(C) The minivan is the third-oldest\n(D) The bus is the third-oldest\n(E) The tractor is the third-oldest\n(F) The station wagon is the third-oldest\n(G) The convertible is the third-oldest",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer to the question is option (E). Here is a step-by-step explanation of why the answer is (E):\n\n1. The paragraph states that the seven vehicles are a truck, a hatchback, a minivan, a bus, a tractor, a station wagon, and a convertible.\n2. The paragraph also states that the station wagon is the fourth-newest and the tractor is the second-oldest.\n3. Since the station wagon is the only vehicle that has its age explicitly stated as being after the tractor, it follows that the tractor must be the third-oldest.\n4. Therefore, option (E) is the correct answer. Answer is (E).",

            "correct_answer": "(C)",
            "model_answer": "To deduce the correct order of the seven golfers in the tournament, we will need to use the given statements and their logical relationships to work backwards and eliminate possibilities until we reach a satisfying answer.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate any golfers who finished above or below each other within their statements. For example, Ada finished above Rob, so we know that Ada did not finish in the order a, b, c, d, e, f, or g. Similarly, Eve finished a, b, c, d, e, f, or g. And Mel also finished a, b, c, d, e, f, or g. So we know that each of these golfers finished a particular order.\n\nNext, let's look at the relationships between the remaining golfers. The statement \"Mel finished above Eli\" means that Mel did not finish below Eli - so a, b, c, d, e, f, or g is not Mel's order. Additionally, the statement \"Mel finished above Dan\" means that Mel did not finish below Dan - so a, b, and c are not Mel's order. Similarly, the statement \"Dan finished above Mel\" means that Dan did not finish below Mel - so d, e, f, a, b, c, or g are not Dan's order. And \"Dan finished above Eli\" means that Dan did not finish below Eli - so d, e, a, b, c, or f are not Dan's order.\n\nNow, we have eliminated all the possible orders for Mel and Dan - but what about Rob and Ada? The statement \"Rob finished above Ada\" means that Rob did not finish below Ada - so c, d, a, b, f, or e are not Rob's order. And the statement \"Ada finished above Rob\" means that Ada did not finish below Rob - so b, d, a, c, f, or e are not Ada's order.\n\nSo we have eliminated all the possible orders except for d, e, or f for Rob, and b, c, or d for Ada.\n\nFrom the remaining orders, it is clear that Rob finished above Dan - so d, a, b, c, or e are not Rob's order. And \"Dan finished above Rob\" means that Dan did not finish below Rob - so c, d, a, b, f, or e are not Dan's order. So we know that rob finished either b, a, or c and dan finished either f, b, or a.\n\nUsing these order possibilities, we can deduce that Eve finished a, Mel finished b, Ada finished c, Rob finished d, and Dan finished f.",
