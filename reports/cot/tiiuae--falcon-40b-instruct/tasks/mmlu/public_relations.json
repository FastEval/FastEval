Ingratiation: Your goal is to create goodwill towards the company and increase understanding of the situation from your audience. You will explain how you plan to resolve the crisis, so you appear trustworthy and transparent.\n\n2. Downplaying: Your goal is to minimize the perception of the crisis and the negative impact it may have on your business. You will try to paint a picture that the crisis isn't as severe as it seems.\n\n3. Distancing: Your goal is to distance your company from the crisis, and deflect blame and responsibility from the company onto others. You will try to make the crisis appear to be something you have no control over, and deflect blame and punishment from the audience or media.\n\n4. Nonexistence: Your goal is to pretend the crisis doesn't exist, and you will attempt to eliminate all signs of the crisis from any communication channels or media.\n\nNow answer the question: Which of the four is NOT one of the crisis communication strategies identified by Coombs?\n\nAssistant: Once you have identified the answer, you can output it.\n\nThe correct answer is D) nonexistence.",
