            "model_answer": "For the given set of weights of 300 milligrams, the mean is 300 with standard deviation (100*0.002)/7 = 0.287. Using the formula z = (x - \u03bc)/\u03c3, and given that the weight of the sample is approximately normally distributed with mean and standard deviation as stated, we find that the standard normal deviate is 0.285. For the hypothesis that the mean of the population is 300, we require P(z > 0.285) = P(t > 1.54). Using invertible cumulative distribution functions or tables, this is approximately 2.575%, which is the P-value of the test.",

However, regarding the explanation of the correct answer you wanted, the correct answer (D) options states that outliers are significantly different than the other observations in the data set. An outlier is an observation that is unusually distant from the rest of the data, making it an extreme value. By definition, an outlier differs significantly from the rest of the data in the sense that they might be either very large or very small in value when compared to the rest of the data. This significant difference can be caused by various reasons such as systematic errors in the data recording process or, more commonly, the existence of a small number of extreme values in the data set.",

However, based on the given information, the confidence interval presented by the principal suggests that 95% of the families in the school have an income between $35,095 and $45,005. Therefore, the confidence interval does not directly compare with the actual average income per family of her students, but rather provides an estimated range of possible incomes for the families within the school.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, I will need to differentiate between Type I and Type II errors. Type I error is when a null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected, leading to a rejection of the true null hypothesis. A Type II error is when a null hypothesis is not rejected, despite it being false. With that said, let's start by considering the original experiment. If the null hypothesis is falsely rejected, that would be a Type I error, so the probability of a Type I error would decrease by having twice as many experimental units for each treatment. Additionally, since the null hypothesis is actually correct, the probability of a Type II error will also decrease because there is less chance of mistakenly not rejecting the null hypothesis. Therefore, answer (B) is the correct one.",

            "model_answer": "Good job! Your answer is option D! The height of a woman who is one standard deviation above the mean height of all women is more unusual, because the standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the data is around the mean and one standard deviation is a relatively small difference between a data point and the mean compared to two standard deviations. Therefore, the one standard deviation height difference between the two individuals makes the female more unusually tall.",
