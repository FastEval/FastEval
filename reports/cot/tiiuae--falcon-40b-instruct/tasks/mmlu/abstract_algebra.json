Then Q(x) is an extension of Q of degree 4.\n\n<p>To prove this, let d be the degree of the given field extension Q(sqrt(2),sqrt(3),sqrt(18)) over Q. Then x^n is an expression for a root of the polynomial f(x) over Q (where f(x) is the product of the equations x^2 - 2 = 0 and either x^3 - 2sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3) = 0 or x^3 + 2sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3) = 0).</p>\n\n<p>If x^3 - 2sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3) = 0, then the coefficient of x^3 is x^3 - 2sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3), which is x^n. If x^3 + 2sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3) = 0, then the coefficient of x^3 is x^3 + 2sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3), which is x^n. Therefore, d >= 4, and hence the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2),sqrt(3),sqrt(18)) over Q is at most 4.</p>\n\n<p>If d is 4, then Q(x) is an extension of degree 4. For example, let Q(x) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)). Then Q(2) + Q(3) = Q(sqrt(9) - 3sqrt(2) - 3sqrt(3) - sqrt(18) + (3-2-3)sqrt(2) + (3-2+3)sqrt(3)) = Q(sqrt(9) - 3sqrt(2) - 3sqrt(3) - sqrt(18)). Also, Q(3) + Q(2) = Q(sqrt(18) + (3+2+2)sqrt(18)). This shows that the elements of Q(x) are algebraically independent over Q.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2),sqrt(3),sqrt(18)) over Q is 4.</p>",

First, we need to express the coefficients of each polynomial as integers in the same ring modulo 8 (since 8 is a prime number and every prime number has exactly two non-zero non-common prime divisors with respective multiplicative orders, i.e., z^2 = z).\n\nWe get:\n\n    g(x) = {0, 103 },\n    f(x) = {Temperature,101 }\n\nNow, we need to find the gcd of the two polynomials modulo 8, which is 1. Therefore, the multiplicative order of 103 modulo 8 is 1, and the multiplicative order of Temperature modulo 8 is also 1, hence\n\n    gcd(Temperature,103) = 1.\n\nSince we have the multiplicative orders ofTemperature and 103 modulo 8, we can factorize the polynomial g(x) into:\n\n    g(x) = (Temperature)(x - 1) = x + Temperature - 1\n\nSimilarly, we can factorize f(x) into:\n\n    f(x) = (4)(x - 1) = 4x + 3 - 1\n\nTherefore, the product of the two given polynomials in the given polynomial ring can be expressed as:\n\n    g(x)*f(x) = 4 Temperature - 5 * 4x - 3 + 1 * 2 Temperature - 1 * (Temperature) - Temperature - 1\n    = 4 Temperature - 5 * 8x - 3 + 1 * 2 Temperature + Temperature + 1\n    = 32 Temperature - 10 Temperature - 80 + 32 Temperature - 32\n\nWe can factorize the expression further to simplify it:\n\n    32 Temperature - 40 = 282 - 40\n    (Temperature) + Temperature + 1 = 282 - 40\n    (Temperature)^2 + 1 = 282 - 40\n    Temperature^2 - 40 = 282 - 41\n    Temperature^2 - Temperature = 282 - 42\n    Temperature - 21 = 281 - 42\n    Temperature - 15 = 280 - 42\n    Temperature = 282 - 42.\n\nFinally, we can express the product as:\n\n    g(x)*f(x) = (4 Temperature - 5) * 8x - 3.\n\nAssistant: Is there anything else I need to do before outputting the final answer?\nTemperature = 282 - 42\n\nYes, we need to convert the answer into a single letter using the normal form modulo 8 since we have expressed the coefficients as multiples of 8. Additionally, we need to convert the final polynomial back into standard form.\n\nTemperature = 282 - 42\nf(x)Temperature - 5\n\nConverting the product back into standard form, we get:\n\n    f(x)Temperature - 5 = 4 Temperature - 5.\n\nTemperature = 282 - 42\nf(x)Temperature - 5 = 4 Temperature - 5\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B).",

Thus, a ring homomorphism is one-to-one if and only if any element of the source ring that is not an element of the ideal is mapped to an element of the target ring that is not an element of its ideal.
