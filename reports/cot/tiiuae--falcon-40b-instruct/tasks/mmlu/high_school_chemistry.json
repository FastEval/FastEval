            "model_answer": "(I apologize for the delayed response) I am an AI language model and do not have access to calculators or applications, however, I will try my best to assist you with the given question. \n\nLet's start by defining the formula for partial pressure of gases in a sealed rigid container. The formula for partial pressure of a gas in a mixture is described as follows:\n\n`P_i = (ni / n)` \nwhere:\n\n- P_i is the partial pressure of the gas i in the mixture \n- ni is the number of moles of gas i in the mixture \n- n is the total number of moles of gas in the mixture \n\nWe also know the total pressure of the gases in the container, which is equal to:\n\n`P_total = n(R / V) / N` \nwhere:\n\n- P_total is the total pressure of the gases \n- n is the total number of moles of gas in the mixture \n- R is the universal gas constant \n- V is the volume of the container \n- N is the number of moles of gas per liter (which is the same as ni) \n\nAssuming that the gases are in equilibrium and have equal volumes, we can simplify the formula for partial pressure of gas in a mixture:\n\n`P_i = (P_total / N)` \nwhere:\n\n- P_i is the partial pressure of the gas i in the mixture \n- P_total is the total pressure of the gases in the container \n- N is the number of moles of gas per liter \n\nTherefore, to calculate the partial pressure of nitrogen, we can substitute P_i with the total pressure in the given problem and P_total with the total pressure in the gas formula.\n\n`P_i = (P_total / N)` \n\n`P_i = (2 atm / N)`  \n \n`P_i = (2 / 3) atm`  \n \n`P_i = 1.33 atm`\n\nThus, the answer is A - 1.33 atm.",
