            "model_answer": "Let's start by analyzing the first statement. Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators because it uses all the data points to accurately reflect the underlying distribution. Moreover, it respects the data that has a lower magnitude in the process of computing the mean. It is also an unbiased estimator because it correctly represents the true mean of the data set. Therefore, linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all the unbiased estimators.\n\nMoving on to the second statement, while the coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative in theory, it is not true in practice. The coefficients learned by AdaBoost can be negative if the algorithm does not see enough positive samples for a particular class. For example, if a dataset contains only negative instances of class A and positive instances of class B, the algorithm may assign a negative coefficient to the weak classifier for class A, which contradicts the statement. Therefore, statement 2 is false.\n\nBased on the information provided, Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False. Therefore, the final answer is (A).",

This may be true because RoBERTa has been pre-trained on approximately 100 billion words from the Common Crawl dataset, while BERT was initially trained on the English Wikipedia corpus, which has a size of approximately 2 billion words.\n\nStatement 2 could be true because the tanh activation function was commonly used in deep neural networks before the ReLU function gained popularity in 2010. However, it is not clear whether the same was applicable in ResNeXts in 2018. Therefore, the answer could be either True or False, based on the availability of reliable information about the use of tanh activation function in ResNeXts in 2018.

This is because when using a kernel function like the linear or polynomial kernel, the amount of slack or margin in the decision boundary can be different for each input example. This slack is the difference between the Hungarian assignment and the actual data-label pair. \n\nStatement 2 is also correct because as the complexity of the kernel function increases, it is more likely to capture the subtle differences between the input examples. However, it is still possible for the support vectors to change slightly, especially if the input data contains outliers or noise. \n\nIn conclusion, both statements are true, and the answer is (A).",
