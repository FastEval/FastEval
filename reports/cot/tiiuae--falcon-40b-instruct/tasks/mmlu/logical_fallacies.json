            "question": "A valid disjunctive syllogism has a major premise that:\n\n(A) includes two or more alternatives\n(B) classifies subjects\n(C) affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent\n(D) leads to a valid conclusion",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Here are the steps to come to the answer:\n\n1. Suppose the major premise has no alternatives. Then it directly affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent, which is not classifying and does not lead to a valid conclusion. So, (B) is false.\n\n2. Suppose the major premise includes only one alternative. This means it contains a single conclusion and implies a single antecedent. But if the antecedent is true, then the conclusion is also true. Since syllogisms are about classifications and conditional reasoning, a single conclusion and antecedent combination is not a valid disjunctive syllogism. So, (A) is false.\n\n3. Suppose the major premise includes two or more alternatives. This means it contains disjunctions, i.e., two or more mutually exclusive alternatives that cannot occur simultaneously. So we can use our inference rules to transform the disjunction into an implication.\n\n4. If the major premise is true, then one disjunct is true and the others are false. Therefore, if the disjunction is true, then at least one disjunct is true. Otherwise, some disjunct might be false. However, the minor premise is a universal statement that applies to all members of the class in question, and since disjunctive syllogisms are about symmetry, each disjunct should be symmetric in order to form a disjunctive syllogism. Here's a counterexample:\n\nFalcons have feathers.\n\nCorvids do not have feathers.\n\nThis implies that all corvids are birds and all birds are non-feathered.\n\n5. So, disjunctive syllogisms have the following rule: Let f be the antecedent of a major disjunctive proposition in a valid disjunctive syllogism. Then, one and only one disjunct in the proposition f is true. This means that the major disjunctive proposition f is composed of at least three disjuncts.\n\n6. By inference symmetry, if f is disjunctive, so are its disjuncts. Let f be disjunctive. Suppose one disjunct of f is true. Then the other disjuncts are false. Now suppose that someone tries to support the conclusion that the other disjunct is true by saying that one disjunct is true. This argument can work only if the other disjunct is an odd number of propositions. Otherwise, some disjunct might be false. However, the minor premise is a universal statement that applies to all members of the class in question, and since disjunctive syllogisms are about symmetry, each disjunct should be symmetric in order to form a disjunctive syllogism.\n\n7. Suppose the other disjunct is an odd number of propositions. Then the other disjunct has between one and n-1 disjuncts (where n is the number of disjuncts in the proposition). If one disjunct of the proposition is true, then no other disjunct is true. Therefore, by logic and symmetry, the proposition is true only if at least one disjunct is true. By inference symmetry, if f is disjunctive, so are its disjuncts. Since at least one disjunct is true, then by inference symmetry, each disjunct is true.\n\n8. If the proposition includes only two disjuncts and one disjunct is true, then the other disjunct is false. Therefore, no conclusion can be justified by an antecedent which contains only two disjuncts. For instance, the following proposition is incorrect:\n\nIf someone is a bird, they are either a crow or a swallow.\nCorvids and swallows are both birds.\nTherefore, crows are swallows.\n\nCorvids are not swallows, and swallows are not crows. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\n9. If f contains only two disjuncts, one disjunct is false. Therefore, the other disjunct cannot be false. Now suppose that one disjunct is false. Then at least one other disjunct is false. Now suppose that one disjunct is false. Then at least one other disjunct is false. Therefore, there are no true disjuncts. Thus, at least one of the disjuncts is true. Therefore, at least one of the disjuncts is true.\n\n10. If f contains three or more disjuncts and the proposition f is disjunctive, so are its disjuncts. Let f be disjunctive. Suppose one disjunct of f is true. Then the other disjuncts are false. Now suppose that someone tries to support the conclusion that the other disjunct is true by saying that one disjunct is true. This argument can work only if the other disjunct is an odd number of propositions. Since at least one disjunct is true, then by inference symmetry, symmetry requires that each disjunct be true.\n\n11. So, there are two possible cases: f contains odd or even number of disjuncts. If f contains an odd number of disjuncts, then at least one disjunct is true. By logic and symmetry, the proposition is true only if at least one disjunct is true. By inference symmetry, if f is disjunctive, so are its disjuncts. Let f be disjunctive. Suppose one disjunct of f is true. Then the other disjuncts are false. Now suppose that someone tries to support the conclusion that the other disjunct is true by saying that one disjunct is true. This argument can work only if the other disjunct is an odd number of propositions. If the other disjunct is odd, then each disjunct is true. Therefore, by inference symmetry, the proposition is also true. Since at least one disjunct is true, then by inference symmetry, symmetry requires that each disjunct be true.\n\n12. So, there are two possible cases: f contains odd or even number of disjuncts. If f contains an odd number of disjuncts, then at least one disjunct is true. Since at least one disjunct is true, then by inference symmetry, each disjunct is true. If f contains even number of disjuncts, then no conclusion can be justified by an antecedent which contains only two disjuncts. For instance, the following proposition is incorrect: If someone is a bird, they are either a crow or a swallow. Corvids and swallows are both birds. Therefore, crows are swallows.</s> \nIn order to answer the question, what answer can be directly outputted without going through step-by-step logic and without any additional information?</s> \nOne possible answer is:\n\nA valid disjunctive syllogism has exactly three disjuncts composed of a major conclusion and multiple premises.

The fallacy of style over substance occurs when a speaker presents an idea in a manner that sounds persuasive or well crafted, without providing actual evidence for the claim. It is commonly seen in advertising or political speeches, where the speaker manipulates language or imagery for the purpose of appealing to the emotions or desires of the audience, without addressing the merits of the argument itself. It can be tempting to listen to a speaker who uses this fallacy, as they may seem convincing and appear to have a great deal of insight into the subject. However, it is important for both speakers and audience members to be critical of the substance of an argument, regardless of how it is presented. Focus should be on the evidence provided, the logic of the argument, and the claims being made, rather than how well-crafted or persuasive a specific statement may be.",

Identify the relevance fallacy: First, make sure to identify the relevance fallacy in order to avoid its consequences. Double-checking the relevance and plausibility of evidence can help prevent mistakes in a logical argument.\n\n2. Be careful about accepting prior biases: Be aware of your own biases and try to avoid accepting them as facts. It is always best to double-check the source and credibility of information before accepting it as a truth.\n\n3. Avoid sin of relevance arguments when possible: Avoid making relevance arguments to avoid falling into the sins of relevance sin of relevance arguments when possible.\n\n4. Be open to learning and revising: Good arguments are made with a willingness to understand and potentially revise one's own beliefs. Allow for the possibility of changing one's mind if the evidence insists.\n\n5. Utilize rhetoric effectively: Finally, make sure that arguments are composed of logically sound content so that they are persuasive to the intended audience.
