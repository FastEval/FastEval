            "model_answer": "Let's begin. The time required to read a single block of data from disk under version 1 will be represented by t1. For 1,000 bytes of data, t1 = 25 + 8 + 1 + 5 (10) = 39 msec. The time required to read a single block of data from disk under version 2 will be represented by t2. For 4,000 bytes of data, t2 = 25 + 8 + 1 + 7(10) = 42 msec. The ratio r2/r1 will be the ratio of time required in version 2 to time required in version 1. To compute r2/r1, we need to calculate the time required to read a single block of data from disk under version 2, then find the time required to read that same block of data from disk under version 1. This can be done by dividing t2 by t1. Thus, r2/r1 = t2/t1 = 42/39 = 1.1 approximately.

            "model_answer": "The key to answering this question is understanding the notion of maximum independent set (MIS) in undirected graphs. The MIS is the largest set of nodes in an undirected graph such that no two nodes in the set are connected by an edge. In this case, since there is at most one edge between any pair of nodes, the degree of each node is either exactly 1 or 0. This means that every edge is in one of the maximum independent sets that may exist in the graph. Therefore, we can compute the MIS at most once and check if it is consistent with any of the possible graphs in the given collection. We can do this as follows:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Let's find the number of nodes with in-degree 1, which we will denote by n1. This gives us the number of edges in the maximum independent set that may exist in the graph. Note that n1 \u2264 10 since there are at most 10 nodes and hence exactly 10n1 - 10 = 60 edges in the graph.\n\n<ol>\n<li>For each graph at most 10 nodes exist with in-degree 1. Let's call this graph G. We know that the number of disconnected components in G is at most 1, since at most one node has in-degree 1. We can define the number of node degrees as d(G) = (n1 - 1) + x, where x is the average in-degree of nodes between 1 and n. Hence, we have d(G) \u2264 m. This gives the following inequality:\n\n10 d(G) \u2264 10m holds for each graph G with n1 \u2264 10.\n\nSince G has in-degree 1 on all nodes, it is possible that G has exactly at most m = 6 neighbors for each node. This means that we may have disconnected components. However, G can be further constrained by the fact that it has an average in-degree exactly 4 (since 16m at most \u2264 10). Hence, G must have the maximum possible number of nodes with in-degree 1, which is 9.\n\n<li>Plugging n1 = 9 into the average in-degree constraint gives us:\n\n16m = 18 >= 10. \n\nThis gives the following inequality:\n\n10 d(G) \u2265 10m holds for each graph G with n1 > 1.\n\nTherefore, the number of independent sets is given by n = d(G) + 1, and we may have disconnected components.\n\n<ol>\n<li>Let's do some more algebraic manipulation on the average in-degree constraint to determine possible values of m. Let's denote the number of nodes with in-degree 1 as x.\n\n16 x = d(G) + (n - x) = 10m + (n - x) where x \u2264 n.\n\nSince G has in at most an m = 10 edge, we have:\n\n4 d(G) + (10m - 17) = 22 + x giving the following inequalities:\n\n4 d(G) \u2264 10m + x, \n4 d(G) \u2265 10m - 17,\n10 d(G) \u2264 10m, \n10 d(G) \u2265 10m + 17.\n\n<li>The maximum possible value of m is 10, which gives us that the number of independent sets is given by\nn = d(G) + 1 = m = 10.\n\nThe maximum possible value of m is 10, which gives us that the number of independent sets is given by\nn = d(G) = m = 6.\n\nThe maximum possible value of m is 8, which gives us that the number of independent sets is given by\nn = d(G) + 1 = m = 8.\n\nThe maximum possible value of m is 7, which gives us that the number of independent sets is given by\nn = d(G) + 1 = m = 7.\n\nThe maximum possible value of m is 4, which gives us that the number of independent sets is given by\nn = d(G) + 1 = m = 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.](/sci/tex-pre-filters/stackoverflow39.svg#_itc000idm)",
