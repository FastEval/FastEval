Using this information, we can derive that to obtain the reflecting line through the point X, we must find a point that is perpendicular to the side with endpoints (X,Y). Since the reflecting line is mapped to the left of P by X', we can conclude that the slope of the side opposite the larger slope is positive. Therefore, P' should be mapped to the left of P such that its leftmost point is a vertex. Therefore, the intersection point of the two sides joined by vertex Y should be located below Y in order to conform with the positive slope of X' opposite the larger slope. Consequently, vertex Y will be on the left side of the perpendicular line that passes through Y. Therefore, the equation of the line is y=mx+b, where m is X'Y/|X'|.\n\nUsing the scale factor of (4x-3y,3y-4x,y-x), we can obtain the following equation:\n\nX'Y/|X'| = (4x-3y)(-2-3y) = -2-3y(-4+y) = -8+12y = 4y+12\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line is y=mx+b, where m=4 and b=12. Plugging in the endpoints of the side opposite the larger slope (-4,1) and (2,-4), we obtain:\n\ny=mx+b = 12x - 0.75\n12x = -84.75 \n- x = 7 \nTherefore, vertex Y will be located at (\u2013x,y). Substituting the values of x and y, we obtain vertex Y as (7,-1).",

            "model_answer": "Can you please explain your reasoning step-by-step?\n\nSure, here are my steps:\n\n1. Let's start by thinking about the line segment $(0,5)$ that connects $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$. According to the problem statement, this line segment is above the curve $y = f(x)$ for all values of x between $(-2,0)$ and $2,0)$. This means that for any $x$ between $(-2,0)$ and 2,0), the point $(x,f(x))$ lies below $(0,5)$.\n2. Since $f$ is strictly convex, the slope must increase as you go from negative to positive values of x. This tells us that the slope of the line segment is less than the slope of the curve. The slope of the line segment is the ratio of vertical and horizontal distances: $m = 5-\\frac{5-(-2)}{0-(-2)} = -5$, which means that the line segment is quite steep.\n3. Now let's consider the slope of the curve. If we take a small interval around 0, the curve looks almost flat, so the slope in this case is close to 0. But for larger values of x, the slope is quite steep. We can use the fact that the slope of the curve is the same for small changes in x to estimate the slope in a larger interval. Since $f(x)$ increases to infinity as x approaches $2$ from below, we can estimate the slope in this interval as the limit of the slope in smaller intervals. This tells us that the slope is quite large if $x$ is close to 0, and rapidly decreases as $x$ increases.\n4. Combining steps 2 and 3, we can estimate the slope of the curve around the midpoint $x=1$. If $f(x)$ is close to either endpoint, the slope is virtually infinite, so the estimate is unstable. We can assume that the slope is approximately linear in this neighborhood, with slope $-5$ near $0$ and slope $0$ near 2. This estimate tells us that the slope of the line segment is less than the slope of the curve in this neighborhood, so the curve must be below the line segment for all values of $x$ between $0$ and 2.\n5. The function $f(x)$ is continuous, so it can't jump up or down between 0 and 2. If it starts above the line segment at 0, it must stay above the line segment for all values of $x$ between 0 and 2. So if $f(0)$ is less than 0, the function can't have value 5 at 1. We can thus eliminate answer choices (B) and (D).\n6. Now let's estimate the slope of the curve again. For small values of x, the function $e^{-ax}$ is a good approximation of the shape of the curve, so the slope must increase approximately linearly with x until the curve reaches the vertical asymptote at x=0. If we take a small interval around 0, the curve looks almost flat, so the slope in this case is close to 0. But for larger values of x, the slope is quite steep. We can use the fact that the slope of the curve is the same for small changes in x to estimate the slope in a larger interval. Since $f(x)$ approaches $\\infty$ as $x$ approaches 2 from below, we can estimate the slope in this interval as the limit of the slope in smaller intervals. This tells us that the slope is quite large if $x$ is close to 0, and rapidly decreases as $x$ increases. Combining steps 5 and 6, we can see that the slope of the line segment is quite large if $x$ is close to 0, and decreases as $x$ increases. Since the slope of the curve is increasing as $x$ increases, we see that the two slopes must cross somewhere between 0 and 2. If the slope of the curve lies between the negative slope of the line segment (i.e. $f(0)$ is negative), then the curve must cross the line segment from below. Conversely if the slope of the curve lies between the positive slope of the line segment (i.e. $f(0)$ is positive or zero), then the curve must cross the line segment from above. Thus we can eliminate answer choices (C) and (A).\n7. Since the curve crosses the line segment from above, the value $f(1)$ must be positive. We know that $f(0)$ is positive, so $f(1)$ must be greater than 2 or greater than 5, since $f(x)$ is increasing. Thus the answer is (7).\n\nThe range of possible values for $f(1)$ is thus $(-\\infty,2) \\cup \\{7\\} \\cup \\{9\\} \\cup \\{10\\}$.",

To prove it, we can start by noticing that the prime factorization of $1200$ is:\n\n$$\n1200 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1\n$$\n\nTherefore, any positive integer $n$ that is a factor of $1200$ must be divisible by at least one of the prime factors $2, 3$ or $5$.\n\nIf $n$ is divisible by $2$, then it must also be either a multiple of $3$ or a multiple of $5$. If $n^2$ is a factor of $1200$, then $n$ must also be a factor of $500$ or a factor of $600$. However, $500$ is the largest triangle number that is also a perfect square, so it cannot be a factor of $1200$. Therefore, $n$ can only be a factor of $600$. Since $600$ is divisible by $2$, it is also divisible by $3$, and so $n$ must be divisible by $6$. This gives us a total of $500$ factors that are multiples of $6$ and are also divisible by $3$. Therefore, the applicable prime would be $3$, and the prime factorization of $1200$ would be $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1$. Since the total number of factors for $1200$ that are divisible by $3$ is equal to the number of factors for $1200$ that are divisible by $3$ and are also divisible by $6$, the number of factors for $1200$ that are divisible by $3$ should be $150$.
