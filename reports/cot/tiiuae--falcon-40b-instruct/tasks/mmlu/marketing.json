            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Let's go through this reasoning step by step. One way to narrow down the answer is to think about the significant economic and industrial developments during those times. The late 1800s were marked by the consumption of mass-produced goods, the transition from a rural to an urban economy, and the emergence of national advertising. While the marketing industry was in its infancy during this period, it wasn't yet a fully formed profession.\n\nIn the early 1900s, the marketing function began to gain importance and sophistication. With the rise of modern advertising agencies, large-scale industrial production, and rapid urbanization, corporations began to recognize the need for coordinated consumption. This led to the development of market research, advertising campaigns, and the early use of standardized marketing models. Nevertheless, the economy remained largely focused on consumption rather than production.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the production period was in full swing. The focus shifted to increasing productivity and reducing costs, as companies tried to compete in the increasingly global economy. Mass production enabled widespread consumption, which added to the momentum of the new profession of marketing. The marketing function developed further during this period, as companies began to rely more on market research and advertising to reach consumers.\n\nThe Second World War slowed down the pace of economic growth and the marketing industry. However, in the decades that followed, the transition from a production to a consumption-based economy accelerated. Companies began to focus on consumer demand and brand differentiation, rather than simply seeking to maximize output. The marketing profession continued to grow and evolve, incorporating new research techniques, tools, and technologies.\n\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the production period did not end in the late 1800s but rather transitioned into consumption in the early 1900s and beyond. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).",

The other factors are (A) the level of tangibility, (B) performance-value, and (C) variations in supply and demand.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Firstly, it is necessary to know the various types of conditioning. \n\nClassical conditioning: It is a type of behaviorism where an object (an existing stimulus) is paired with a previously existing stimulus (unconditioned stimulus) resulting in a new learned response which is called a conditioned stimulus.\n\nOperant conditioning: It is also a type of behaviorism where a person/animal learns a new stimulus as a low or high probability to an existing behavior. Hence, it is a reinforcement-based conditioning.\n\nSocial learning: It is also known as observational learning, where people learn through observing others. It not only includes the observation, but also the rectification of the observed behavior.\n\nBehavioural learning: It is a type of learning where low or high probability is attributed to an action of an object (an existing stimulus) resulting low or high probability to an existing behavior. Hence, it falls between operant conditioning and classical conditioning.\n\nNow, given the question, \" Providing free samples of perfumes (scent) in magazines is an example of which of the following?\", it is necessary to apply the given information to analyze the question.\n\nBeing an \"example\", it is necessary to form a relationship with the various types of learning listed above. As the question contends to the \" free samples of perfumes\" which could be a monetary stimulus as samples low or high probability. Hence, it could be classified as \" behavioural conditioning\". However, low or high probability is attributed to an action of an object (an existing stimulus) resulting low or high probability to an existing behavior. Hence, it could also be classified as operant low or high probability learning. Moreover, the audience (magazine readers) is not taking part explicitly in this action. Hence, it can be classified as classical conditioning.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate answer would be: (D) Behavioural learning low or high probability.",
