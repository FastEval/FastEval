            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what leverage effect means in finance. Leverage effect refers to the exposure an investor has to changes in the performance of an underlying asset. If leverage is positive, a change in the asset value will have a larger impact on the investor's return than if leverage is negative.\n\n\nIn this context, if there were a leverage effect in practice, it would mean that changes in the asset values in the model accounted for leverage. Therefore, the news impact curve of such a model would reflect leverage, which would depend on the amount of leverage in the system.\n\n\nA positive leverage effect means that investors are exposed to large changes in asset values for positive/negative changes in asset value of the same magnitude. Therefore, a news impact curve reflecting leverage would rise quickly for negative disturbances and less quickly for positive disturbances relative to the same magnitude.",

The asymmetric adjustment implies that historical high return observations will tend to be followed by low return observations in the next period, whereas the reverse is true following high return observations. This is captured in the conditional squared returns.\n\n- The leverage effects can also be captured in the GARCH(1,1) model by introducing the sensitivity parameter. A positive sensitivity implies that large return observations will tend to be followed by large return observations in the near future, whereas the reverse is true following small return observations, capturing the leverage effect.\n\n- Finally, the GARCH(1,1) model allows for volatility clustering or the phenomenon where periods of high volatility are followed by periods of low volatility. This is captured by the squared covariance adjustment introduced in the model.\n\nPutting everything together, the correct features of financial asset return time-series that can be captured using a standard GARCH(1,1) model are asymmetric adjustment, long-range dependence and short-memory in the return time-series, asymmetric adjustment, the sensitivity parameter, and volatility clustering.",
