            "model_answer": "Before answering the question, I would like to start by noting that all three of the given options could plausibly be the comma-separated values representing the range of valid values for a single token. However, given comma separation under double quotes is usually interpreted as three separate tokens, my output is assuming the range comma separation under double quotes is meant to convey three separate tokens as well. Here are my step-by-step explanations for each option, followed by the final answer.\n\n(A) No: The double quotes representing the range of valid values for a single token are likely not in the correct format for this answer, as \"presenteeism\" is not a valid token. It could, however, represent a larger token with \"presenteeism\" as a substring. Therefore, I cannot be sure which part of the answer belongs to this specific option.\n\n(B) No: This option is not a valid token, as the range comma separation under double quotes is meant to convey three separate tokens, but this option has only one.\n\n(C) Yes: This is the correct answer. The tokens within double quotes indicate the valid values, and this is a valid token. \"Work-play\" is a combination of \"work\" and \"play,\" a common term used to describe the balance between work life and leisure activities. This could lead one to infer that \"work-play balance\" is the comma-separated values representing the range of valid values for a single token, but again, given comma separation under double quotes is usually interpreted as three separate comma-separated values representing the range of valid values for a single token, the correct answer is \"work-play balance.\"\n\n(D) No: This option is not a valid token, as the currency of \"work\" is activity comma separation under double quotes representing the range of valid values for a single token is meant to convey comma separation under double quotes representing the range of valid values for a single token, but this option has one.",

            "model_answer": "<p>Let\u2019s start by defining what power, resources, and asymmetric information are and how they intersect with business-CSO collaborations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Power:</strong> Power refers to the ability to control, influence or adapt the behavior of others.</li>\n<li><strong>Resources:</strong> Resources are the capabilities that increase the ability to create value for other stakeholders.</li>\n<li><strong>Asymmetric information:</strong> Asymmetric information usually occurs when one party knows more than the other party does, resulting in one party making decisions that may not be in the best interest of the other party.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, let's apply this understanding to business-CSO collaborations and how power, resources, and asymmetric information can impact them. These collaborations are formed when businesses partner with civil society organizations (CSOs) to address social or environmental issues. As such, power imbalances may be present between the two collaborators, with businesses often having more power and resources than the CSOs.</p>\n\n<p>If this power imbalance is not managed effectively, then businesses may take advantage of the partnership to maximize their own interests while minimizing the interests of the CSOs. The CSOs may also feel hoodwinked or co-opted by the businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, if asymmetric information is present in the relationship, the business may be able to increase its own profits at the expense of the CSOs and their stakeholders, which would not be in their best interests. This could be by controlling the information the CSOs receive about the relationship or the business's core activities, or even withholding it from them altogether.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, business-CSO collaborations can be limited and risky due to power imbalances, asymmetric information, and insufficient resources for CSOs. To mitigate these risks, businesses and CSOs must work together to establish clear, and equitable agreements, reduce asymmetric information, identify and address power imbalances, and ensure sufficient resources are allocated to CSOs to allow them to effectively influence and hold businesses accountable for their actions.</p>",

            "question": "Although corporate profit maximization is not directly prescribed by major normative theories to which normative theory is it most similar?\n\n(A) hedonistic utilitarianism\n(B) preference utilitarianism\n(C) The Categorical Imperative\n(D) ethics of care",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "<p>Explanation:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Profit maximization can be seen as a means to achieve hedonistic utilitarianism. This is because profit maximization increases happiness for stakeholders and shareholders, who are making more money. This in turn makes them feel good and happy, which is the ultimate goal of hedonistic utilitarianism.</li>\n\n<li>On the other hand, preference utilitarianism also values happiness, but it takes a different stance on achieving it. Instead of seeking profit, preference utilitarians focus on maximizing pleasure for individuals. However, this can ultimately lead to the same outcome as profit maximization in terms of overall happiness.</li>\n\n<li>The Categorical Imperative is not compatible with profit maximization because it focuses on moral duty. It is concerned with our conduct rather than the pursuit of personal interests. This means that making money is not necessarily good, regardless of the consequences. </li>\n    \n<li>Ethics of care, like hedonistic utilitarianism, places a high emphasis on the well-being of individuals. However, it also values interdependence and relationships. Therefore, it is less about maximizing profit for stakeholders and more about creating ethical and fair business practices. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In conclusion, profit maximization is most similar to hedonistic utilitarianism. Both theories place a high value on individual happiness and endorse practices that increase overall happiness. However, other normative theories such as preference utilitarianism, The Categorical Imperative, and ethics of care have different perspectives on the matter.</p>",

The bracketed piece of information appears to indicate that the regulation has a broader scope than just CSOs interacting with businesses, as it extends to the actual operations and processes of those businesses.
