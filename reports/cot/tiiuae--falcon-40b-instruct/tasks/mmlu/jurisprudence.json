            "model_answer": "As an AI language model, I do not have first-hand experience of the 20th century. However, based on my research, I can suggest that the revival of natural law in the 20th century may have been influenced by a combination of several factors, including the erosion of traditional sources of moral authority, such as religion, cultural traditions, and the authority of nation-states, coupled with the emergence of new forms of governance and the challenges posed by rapid social, economic, and technological changes. Additionally, the atrocities committed during the two world wars, the Holocaust, and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki brought about a renewed sense of outrage and condemnation of the dehumanizing features of modernity, prompting a reexamination of the traditional ethical and legal frameworks and the search for alternatives, including the revival of natural law. The exact contribution of each factor, however, may depend on a more nuanced and complex analysis of the historical, social, and intellectual contexts in which natural law developed.",

            "model_answer": "Good analysis! It's important to realize that the answer to this question may not be straightforward, but you're on the right track. Let's begin by defining each of these schools of thought. \n\nThe Law and Economics School of thought suggests that legal rules should mimic institutional forms that exist in the market and promote market efficiency. The goal of legal decision-making is to eliminate market inefficiencies and promote economically rational behavior. (A)\n\nThe Critical Legal Studies School of thought rejects the notion that law and markets should be aligned since law consistently serves the interests of the powerful and perpetuates inequality. (B)\n\nThe Historical School of thought emphasizes the importance of tradition, custom, and precedent in understanding institutional forms of legality. It emphasizes the role of societal expectations and shared understandings of fairness in shaping legal institutional forms. (C)\n\nFinally, the Natural Law School of thought emphasizes the moral dimension of law and argues that legal institutions should rest on a conception of human nature. It claims that natural law provides objective and universal moral standards for evaluating legal institutions. (D)\n\nSo now we can answer the question. The school that believes that promoting market efficiency should be the central goal of legal decision-making is the Law and Economics School of thought.",

The historical development of capitalism has been attributed to a specific legal framework that emerged in England, called the 'propertarian ethic'. This legal framework allowed for the accumulation of property, which was essential for capitalist production. Weber's legal and historical research sought to identify and explain these features, and his theoretical model of 'law and economy' sought to analyze how law shapes economic development.",
