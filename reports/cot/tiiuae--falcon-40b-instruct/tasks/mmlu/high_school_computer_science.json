            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand how large data sets are typically processed in programming. Generally, two main approaches are used:\n\n- Batch processing: where the data is loaded into memory, processes, and then the output is written to a file or database.\n- Stream processing: where the data is read or written one block at a time.\n\nIn terms of how memory, storage, and processing time affect the program's ability to process large data sets, it depends on the specific characteristics of the data being processed. If the data set is large and doesn't fit into memory, then batch processing may not be feasible. Similarly, if the data is not accessible in one go (e.g. due to network bandwidth or access time constraints), then stream processing may be preferred. So answer (D) (\"How much storage space the program requires as it runs\") could potentially affect the program's ability to process large data sets in some cases, but overall, it is less important than the first three considerations of how long the program takes to run, how many programming statements it contains, and how much memory it requires.",
