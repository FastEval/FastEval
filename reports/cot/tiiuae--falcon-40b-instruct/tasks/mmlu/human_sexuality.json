            "model_answer": "Sociobiologists believe that there are more males than females with paraphilias because...\n(A) paraphilias guarantee survival of the species (B) evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli (C) of left brain/right brain differences between the genders (D) male brains are better developed than are female brains\nAssistant:\nThe Sociobiology view suggests that paraphilias evolved to increase reproductive success. When males have less common and more variable sexual preferences, they are competing with each other over a wider range of mates, and thus exert more evolutionary pressure on the competing males. This results in the selection of more unusual sexual behaviors than would be the case otherwise. The reason more males than females have paraphilias could be that males have less common and more variable sexual preferences. This is supported by the fact that human males produce more testosterone than human females, and testosterone has been associated with sexual deviancy. \n\nCognitive scientists have proposed explanations based on brain structure, dominance and hierarchy. A theory emphasizes the left-right brain and hierarchical view of man's relationship to his own body. This denies the common assumption that feeling and managed damage are the province of the right side...This characteristic plays out classically in the paraphilias. It is a special theory about the brainetic structure of the human female mammal. The theory posits that the male mammal has a feeling sexual managed damage on the right side of the central nervous system.

This could make her feel uncomfortable and pressure to commit before she is ready. In addition, Helen may have experienced hurtful or unreliable relationships in the past that make her hesitant to get too close to someone who seems overly eager for her attention. She may need time to adjust and feel comfortable with the relationship, and may be wary of moving too fast due to past negative experiences.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "OK, let's take this step-by-step. \n\nFirstly, the question is asking us to compare childhood play behavior between Bruce and Chuck, who are both adult men. Research has shown that children\u2019s gender-specific play patterns may be a predictor of their heterosexuality or homosexuality in adulthood. Studies have shown that heterosexual boys tend to demonstrate more male-typical play behavior, and heterosexual girls tend to demonstrate more female-typical behavior. If these patterns hold for Bruce and Chuck as well, we might expect Bruce to have displayed more female-typical behavior as a child. \n\nHowever, there are a few caveats we should consider. Childhood play behavior is influenced by a variety of factors such as environment, opportunity, and culture. Peer pressure can also impact play patterns, so it\u2019s difficult to make a definitive statement based solely on play behavior. Additionally, adult sexuality is more complex than just play patterns, with genetics, environment, and societal pressures all playing a role. \n\nSo, without knowing more about Bruce and Chuck, it\u2019s impossible to make a definitive statement based on play patterns.",
