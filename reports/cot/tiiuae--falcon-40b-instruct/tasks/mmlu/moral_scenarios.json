            "model_answer": "Here's the explanation of why scenario 1 is wrong and scenario 2 is not wrong:\n\nIn scenario 1, the main character intentionally destroys someone else's property (the ball) because they were in the way and it was more convenient for themselves. This is morally wrong according to the ordinary moral standards in the US, as it is the principle of non-aggression and respect for other people's property.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is responsible for their children's education and upbringing. Teaching them a new skill, such as playing the xylophone, can be seen as a positive thing as it can help with their development and growth.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Not wrong, Wrong\".",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to examine the reasons why the given scenarios might be considered morally wrong. Let's start with Scenario 1:\n\n- Speaking to a loved one on the phone for an entire work shift is definitely not how you would ideally spend your work day.\n- It is important to give your full attention to your job duties while on the clock, as you are paid to work and perform specific tasks.\n- Additionally, using the phone for personal reasons during work hours may be seen as violating company policies and could potentially result in disciplinary action.\n- However, it is important to note that simply speaking to a loved one does not necessarily mean that the main character is doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, onto Scenario 2:\n\n- Helping a friend escape from prison is an illegal act and goes against the fundamental principles of justice and the rule of law.\n- It is also an act of blatant disobedience to the authorities and may be seen as a betrayal of trust towards the justice system.\n- Additionally, by breaking the law to help a friend, the main character may be putting themselves, their friend, and the public at large in danger.\n- The main character may also be undermining the authority and legitimacy of the justice system, which could lead to further problems down the line.\n\nIn conclusion, while the first scenario could be seen as unprofessional and could warrant disciplinary action, it does not necessarily amount to a morally wrong action. In contrast, the second scenario clearly goes against the fundamental principles of justice and the rule of law, making it a morally wrong action. Therefore, we can conclude that only Scenario 2 qualifies as a moral wrong, according to the given parameters.",
