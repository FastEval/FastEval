In other words, if a set of operators can express any possible Boolean statement, then it is complete.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options you provided:\n\n(A) {AND, NOT} is a complete set of Boolean operators.

This means that the memory is divided into smaller sections, each of the same size. However, this statement does not necessarily imply that a purely segmented memory system permits implementation of virtual memory or suffers from internal fragmentation.\n\nOption II states that a purely segmented memory system permits implementation of virtual memory. Virtual memory is a technique used in computer systems to enable a program to use more memory than the physical memory available.

However, this statement does not necessarily imply that a purely segmented memory system divides memory into units of equal size or suffers from internal fragmentation.\n\nOption III states that a purely segmented memory system suffers from internal fragmentation. Internal fragmentation occurs when the free memory in a system is not contiguous, meaning that there are gaps or fragments of free memory scattered throughout the system.

Floating-point arithmetic is based on a representation of numbers using a finite number of digits, which means that there may be some numbers that cannot be exactly represented.
