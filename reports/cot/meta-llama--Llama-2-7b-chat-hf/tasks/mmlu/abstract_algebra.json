A factor group is defined as a group that is derived from another group by taking the quotient group, which is a set of cosets of the original group. By definition, a non-Abelian group cannot be Abelian, so any factor group of a non-Abelian group will also be non-Abelian.\n\n statement 2: \"If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\"\n\nTo determine whether this statement is true or false, we need to consider the properties of normal subgroups. A normal subgroup is a subgroup that is invariant under conjugation by any element of the larger group.\n\nIf K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is also a normal subgroup of G. This is because the conjugation action of H on K is inherited from the conjugation action of G on H, so K is invariant under conjugation by any element of G.

Since it has order 15, it can generate all the other elements of the group of the same order. Therefore, there must be at least 8 elements of order 15 in the group, since 8 is the smallest number of elements that can be generated by a single element of order 15.\n\nStatement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nReasoning:\nIf a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, then it must have at least 9 elements of order 15, since 8 is the minimum number of elements that can be generated by a single element of order 15. Therefore, the number of elements of order 15 in the group is at least 16.\n\nAnswer:\nThe correct answer is (B) False, False.\n\nExplanation:\nBoth statements are false.

I'm here to help you with your question.\n\nTo answer your question, we need to carefully examine the statements provided.\n\nStatement 1: \"Every homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphic to a factor group of G.\"\n\nExplanation: A homomorphic image of a group G is a group that arises by applying a linear transformation to G. In other words, it's a group that is obtained by \"pushing\" the elements of G through a linear transformation.\n\nNow, let's consider a factor group of G. A factor group is a group that is obtained by \"pulling\" the elements of G back through a linear transformation.\n\nSo, the question is: are all homomorphic images of G isomorphic to some factor group of G?\n\nThe answer is (A) True, True.\n\nHere's why:\n\nEvery homomorphic image of G is a group that can be obtained by applying a linear transformation to G.

For example, the factor group <a, b | b = a^2> is different from the homomorphic image <a, b | a^2 = 1, b^2 = 1>.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) False, True.\n\nSo, the final answer is (A) True, True.",

Then,\n\n$$(a+b)Q = aQ + bQ \\subseteq Q,$$\n\nsince $a, b \\in R$ and $Q$ is a subset of $R$.\n\nNext, let $q = ar$, where $a \\in R$ and $r \\in Q$.
