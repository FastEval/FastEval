According to the problem, the length of the rectangle is twice its width, so we can set up the equation:\n\nLength = 2 x Width\n\nNext, we are given that the length of the diagonal of the rectangle is $5\\sqrt{5}$. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the area of the rectangle:\n\nArea = Length x Width\n\nSo, we can substitute the value of the length of the diagonal into the area formula:\n\nArea = (5\\sqrt{5}) x Width\n\nNow, we need to find the width of the rectangle. We were given that the length of the rectangle is twice its width, so we can use the equation:\n\nWidth = Length / 2\n\nSubstituting the value of the length of the diagonal into this equation, we get:\n\nWidth = (5\\sqrt{5}) / 2\n\nNow we have the width of the rectangle, so we can find the area of the rectangle:\n\nArea = Length x Width\n= (5\\sqrt{5}) x Width\n= 2500\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) 2500\n\nI hope this helps!
