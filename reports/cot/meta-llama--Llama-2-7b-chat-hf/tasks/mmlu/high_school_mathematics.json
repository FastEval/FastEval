Let's call the width of the rectangle \"w\". Then, the length of the rectangle is twice the width, which is 2w.\n\nThe question also states that the length of the diagonal of the rectangle is $5\\sqrt{5}$. Let's call the length of the diagonal \"d\".\n\nCan you see where this is going? \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThe area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the width. In this case, the length of the rectangle is 2w, and the width is w. So, the area of the rectangle is:\n\nArea = 2w \\* w = 2w^2\n\nNow, the question asks us to find the value of \"w\" in terms of \"d\". Can you see how we can do this? \ud83e\udd14\n\nWe know that the length of the diagonal is $5\\sqrt{5}$, so we can write:\n\nd = 5\\sqrt{5}\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its length and width. In this case, the length of the rectangle is 2w, and the width is w. So, we can write:\n\nArea = 2w \\* w = 2w^2\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of \"d\" into the equation for the area:\n\nd = 5\\sqrt{5}\n\nArea = 2w \\* w = 2w^2\n\nSubstituting the value of \"d\" into the equation for the area, we get:\n\n2w^2 = 5\\sqrt{5}\n\nNow, we can solve for \"w\" by squaring both sides of the equation:\n\n4w^2 = 25\\sqrt{5}\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nw = 5\\sqrt{5}/2\n\nSo, the width of the rectangle is 5\\sqrt{5}/2.\n\nNow, we can find the length of the rectangle by multiplying the width by 2:\n\nLength = 2w = 2(5\\sqrt{5}/2) = 10\\sqrt{5}\n\nSo, the length of the rectangle is 10\\sqrt{5}.\n\nThe final answer is (A) 2500.",

One of its prime factorizations is 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 39. Since 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 and 39 \u00d7 2 = 78, we can see that 6 and 78 are indeed factors of 392.

To find the answer, we need to find the values of $n$ that are factors of $1200$.\n\nA factor of a number is a number that divides that number without leaving a remainder. In other words, if a number $a$ is a factor of $n$, then $a$ divides $n$ without leaving a remainder.\n\nSo, to find the values of $n$ that are factors of $1200$, we need to find all positive integer values of $n$ that divide $1200$ without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet's start by finding the factors of $1200$. A quick way to find the factors of a number is to list all the multiples of that number. So, the factors of $1200$ are:\n\n* $1 \\cdot 1200$\n* $2 \\cdot 600$\n* $3 \\cdot 400$\n* $4 \\cdot 300$\n* $5 \\cdot 240$\n* $6 \\cdot 180$\n* $7 \\cdot 144$\n* $8 \\cdot 120$\n* $9 \\cdot 108$\n* $10 \\cdot 90$\n\nAs we can see, there are 10 factors of $1200$.\n\nNow, let's see how many of these factors are also squares. A square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, $4$ is a square because it can be expressed as $2^2$.\n\nOf the 10 factors of $1200$ we found earlier, only $4$ and $8$ are squares. So, the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $n^2$ is a factor of $1200$ is:\n\n(A) 42\n\nThe remaining options, $(B)$, $(C)$, and $(D)$, do not correspond to any integer value of $n$ that is a factor of $1200$.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n(A) 42",

The probability of getting a 6 on the fifth roll, given that a 6 was rolled on the first four rolls: 1/2 (since there is only one possible outcome left)\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 rolls. Let's define \"at most 2 rolls\" as the event where a 6 is rolled on either the first or second roll, or on the first and second rolls.\n\nUsing the formula for conditional probability, we can calculate the probability of the event \"at most 2 rolls\" as follows:\n\nP(at most 2 rolls) = P(first roll) P(second roll | first roll) + P(first roll) P(second roll | first roll and first roll) + ... + P(first roll) P(second roll | first roll and first roll and first roll)\n\nwhere the \"or\" operator is used to indicate that the event can occur on either the first or second roll.\n\nLet's calculate each term in the sum:\n\nP(first roll) = 1/6\nP(second roll | first roll) = 1/5\nP(second roll | first roll and first roll) = 0 (since the die is fair and the outcome of the second roll is independent of the first roll)\n...\nP(second roll | first roll and first roll and first roll) = 0 (same reason as above)\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the formula and simplify:\n\nP(at most 2 rolls) = (1/6) \u00d7 (1/5) + (1/6) \u00d7 (1/4) + ... + (1/6) \u00d7 (1/2)\n= (1/6) \u00d7 (1/5) + (1/6) \u00d7 (1/4) + ... + (1/6) \u00d7 (1/2)\n= 5/648\n\nSo, the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 rolls is (5/648). \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThe final answer is (A).",
