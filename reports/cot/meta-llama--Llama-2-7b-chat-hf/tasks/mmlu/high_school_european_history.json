According to the passage, Huxley translated the term \"Protoplasm,\" which is the scientific name of the substance of which he was speaking, by the words \"the physical basis of life.\" This suggests that Huxley understood life as something that is made up of physical matter, rather than a force that works through matter.\n\n(B) Huxley did not argue that life is an essentially philosophical notion. While he may have had some philosophical ideas about the nature of life, the passage does not suggest that this was his primary focus.\n\n(C) Huxley did not suggest that life is merely a property of a certain kind of matter. Rather, he argued that life is made up of specific chemical substances, such as carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds.\n\n(D) It is not possible to infer from the passage that Huxley argued that life is a supernatural phenomenon. While he may have had some metaphysical ideas about the nature of life, the passage does not suggest that he believed life to be inherently supernatural.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Life is made up of specific chemical substances.",

This suggests that there was a lack of coherence and consistency in the religious beliefs and practices of ancient Rome, with different groups holding different beliefs and values.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible answers to the question.\n\n(A) In ancient Rome, religious worship was decentralized and tended to vary with one's social position.\n\nThis answer does not accurately represent Gibbon's interpretation of the state of religious worship in ancient Rome. While it is true that religious worship in ancient Rome was not centralized and varied across different social groups, Gibbon's quote suggests that the various modes of worship were also considered equal and true by different groups, regardless of their social position.\n\n(B) In ancient Rome, religious worship was the source of much social tension and turmoil.\n\nGibbon's quote does not support this answer. While it is true that religious tensions and conflicts existed in ancient Rome, Gibbon's quote implies that the various modes of worship were seen as equal and true by different groups, rather than being the source of social tension and turmoil.\n\n(C) In ancient Rome, religious worship was homogeneous and highly centralized.\n\nThis answer is inconsistent with Gibbon's quote, which suggests that the various modes of worship in ancient Rome were diverse and decentralized. While it is true that there was a dominant form of worship in ancient Rome, which was polytheistic, Gibbon's quote does not suggest that religious worship was highly centralized or homogeneous.\n\n(D) In ancient Rome, religious worship was revolutionized by the introduction of Christianity.\n\nGibbon's quote does not address the introduction of Christianity and its impact on religious worship in ancient Rome. While it is true that Christianity played a significant role in shaping religious beliefs and practices in ancient Rome, Gibbon's quote focuses on the diversity and decentralization of religious worship in ancient Rome, rather than its revolutionization by a single religion.\n\nTherefore, the best answer to the question is (C) In ancient Rome, religious worship was decentralized and diverse, with different modes of worship being considered equal and true by different groups.",

In this letter, Voltaire is expressing his thoughts on the disaster and his views on religion, science, and philosophical beliefs. While it is true that Voltaire was an accomplished writer and thinker, it is not accurate to say that he was an accomplished scientist. While he may have had some knowledge of science, he was not a professional scientist in the classical sense.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because while some Enlightenment intellectuals were accomplished scientists, it is not a characteristic that can be applied to all Enlightenment intellectuals.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because while Enlightenment intellectuals did use new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets, they did not limit themselves to these methods alone.\n\nOption (C) is closer to the truth, but it is not the only characteristic of Enlightenment intellectuals. While some Enlightenment thinkers did reject religion altogether and adopt atheism as their credo, many others continued to hold religious beliefs while still advocating for reason, science, and intellectual freedom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues. This option is supported by Voltaire's statements in the letter, where he argues that scientific discoveries should lead to a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the correct answer to your question!",

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him.

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.

To answer your question, I will explain my reasoning step-by-step:\n\nThe differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts can be best accounted for by Option (D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.\n\nLet me explain why:\n\n Option (A) De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery is unlikely, as the account of De las Casas was written in 1542, long after the transatlantic slave trade had begun. While it is true that De las Casas argued for the abolition of slavery, there is no evidence to suggest that he fabricated his accounts of the treatment of the natives by the Spaniards to support the slave trade.\n\n Option (B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings is possible, as Columbus was a prominent figure in the Spanish colonization of the Americas and may have presented a favorable image of himself and his men. However, the language used in both accounts is unusually harsh and critical of the Spaniards, suggesting that De las Casas may have been motivated by a desire to expose the truth about their actions rather than merely promoting himself.\n\n Option (C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions is unlikely, as the account of De las Casas describes the initial interactions between the Spaniards and the natives as violent and destructive, with the natives being killed or enslaved. While it is possible that Columbus's men may have been more benevolent in their interactions with the natives, there is no evidence to support this claim.\n\nOption (D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas is the most plausible explanation for the differences between the accounts. De las Casas was a Spanish bishop who had ordained himself to fight for the rights of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. He had witnessed firsthand the atrocities committed by the Spaniards against the natives and was appalled by their actions. It is likely that he wrote his account with the goal of influencing the Spanish government to change their policies and treat the natives with respect and dignity.\n\nIn conclusion, the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts can be best accounted for by the fact that De Las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.",
