Here we go:\n\nLet's break down the question:\n\n* \"Ms. Perez drove a total of 40 miles in 5 days.\" This means that the total distance Ms. Perez drove is 40 miles.\n* \"She drove the same number of miles each day.\" This implies that Ms. Perez drove the same distance every day.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) 5: This is the total number of days Ms. Perez drove, but it doesn't take into account that she drove the same distance each day.\n\n(B) 7: This is not a possible answer because the question states that Ms. Perez drove the same distance each day. Therefore, the daily distance must be a multiple of 5 (the number of days).\n\n(C) 8: This is not a possible answer because the question states that Ms. Perez drove the same distance each day, and 8 is not a multiple of 5.\n\n(D) 9: This is not a possible answer because the question states that Ms. Perez drove the same distance each day, and 9 is not a multiple of 5.\n\nNow, let's calculate the possible answer:\n\nMs. Perez drove 40 miles in 5 days, which means she drove 8 miles per day (40 miles / 5 days = 8 miles per day).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 5.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n(A) 5",
