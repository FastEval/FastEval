However, I can offer some explanations for each of the options provided:\n\n(A) 8am to 9am: This option assumes that Jessica went to the beach after stretching at the yoga studio and before taking photos near the Eiffel Tower. However, as I mentioned earlier, there is no direct evidence to support this assumption.\n\n(B) 12pm to 3pm: This option assumes that Jessica went to the beach after fixing their computer at the electronic store and before watching a movie at the theater.
