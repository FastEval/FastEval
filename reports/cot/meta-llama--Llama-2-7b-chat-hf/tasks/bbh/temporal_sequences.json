We know that Sarah went to the art studio, but we don't have an exact time for when she went. However, we do have some clues that can help us narrow down the possible times.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the clues one by one:\n\n1. Sarah woke up at 9am.

(This tells us that Sarah was at the bike shop between 9am and 12pm, which means she couldn't have gone to the art studio during this time.)\n3.

Based on the information provided, the only possible time when Sarah could have gone to the art studio is between 6pm and 10pm.

Therefore, we can eliminate Option (A).\n\nOption (B): 6pm to 8pm\nWe know that Hannah went to the garden from 6pm to 8pm. This means that she could have gone to the park between 6pm and 8pm. Therefore, we can choose Option (B).\n\nOption (C): 8pm to 9pm\nWe know that Lisa saw Hannah sitting on a rooftop from 8pm to 9pm.

Between what times could they have gone?\n\nFirst, we know that Sean woke up at 5am.\nSecond, we know that James saw Sean watching a movie at the theater from 5am to 6am. This means that Sean was not at the basketball court during this time.\nThird, we know that David saw Sean buying cookies at a bakery from 6am to 7am. This means that Sean might have gone to the basketball court after buying cookies, but we don't know for sure.\nFourth, we know that Sarah saw Sean working out at the gym from 7am to 9am. This means that Sean was not at the basketball court during this time.\nFifth, we know that William saw Sean attending class at the school from 11am to 2pm. This means that Sean was not at the basketball court during this time.\nSixth, we know that Richard saw Sean taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 2pm to 4pm.
