At the start of the semester, they each buy one new book: Alice gets Hound of the Baskervilles, Bob gets The Odyssey, and Claire gets Catch-22.\n\nYou've listed three options for the book that Alice has at the end of the semester: (A) Hound of the Baskervilles, (B) The Odyssey, and (C) Catch-22.\n\nTo determine the correct answer, let's follow the trading sequence you've described:\n\n1. Claire and Alice swap books.\n2. Bob and Claire swap books.\n3. Alice and Bob swap books.\n\nAfter each of these trades, Alice's book could potentially be any of the three options listed. So, let's analyze each possible outcome:\n\n1. If after trading with Claire, Alice ended up with The Odyssey, then at the end of the semester, she would have (B) The Odyssey.\n2. If after trading with Bob, Alice ended up with Catch-22, then at the end of the semester, she would have (C) Catch-22.\n3. If Alice started the semester with Hound of the Baskervilles and ended up with it after trading with Bob, then at the end of the semester, she would have (A) Hound of the Baskervilles.\n\nSince we cannot determine the exact book that Alice has at the end of the semester based on the information provided, the correct answer is (A) Hound of the Baskervilles.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) Hound of the Baskervilles",

Alice, Bob, and Claire are friends who trade books. They each buy one new book at the start of the semester. Then, they start trading their books with each other.\n\nStep 2: Let's identify the possible combinations of book trades that can happen between Alice, Bob, and Claire. We have three people and three books (The Great Gatsby, Frankenstein, and Ulysses). We can create six different combinations:\n\n* Alice-Bob: Alice gives her book to Bob, and Bob gives his book to Alice.\n* Alice-Claire: Alice gives her book to Claire, and Claire gives her book to Alice.\n* Bob-Claire: Bob gives his book to Claire, and Claire gives her book to Bob.\n* Alice-Bob-Claire: Alice gives her book to Bob, who then gives his book to Claire.\n* Bob-Alice-Claire: Bob gives his book to Alice, who then gives her book to Claire.\n* Claire-Alice-Bob: Claire gives her book to Alice, who then gives her book to Bob.\n\nStep 3: Now that we have identified the possible combinations, we can determine the final book that each person will have at the end of the semester.\n\nFor each combination, we can apply the following logic:\n\n* If Alice and Bob trade books, Alice gets Bob's book and Bob gets Alice's book.\n* If Alice and Claire trade books, Alice gets Claire's book and Claire gets Alice's book.\n* If Bob and Claire trade books, Bob gets Claire's book and Claire gets Bob's book.\n* If Alice, Bob, and Claire trade books, they each get one of the remaining two books.\n\nUsing this logic, we can determine the final book that each person will have at the end of the semester for each possible combination:\n\n* For Alice-Bob: Alice has Frankenstein, Bob has Ulysses, and Claire has The Great Gatsby.\n* For Alice-Claire: Alice has Ulysses, Claire has Frankenstein, and Bob has The Great Gatsby.\n* For Bob-Claire: Bob has The Great Gatsby, Claire has Ulysses, and Alice has Frankenstein.\n* For Alice-Bob-Claire: Alice has Frankenstein, Bob has Ulysses, and Claire has The Great Gatsby.\n* For Bob-Alice-Claire: Bob has The Great Gatsby, Alice has Ulysses, and Claire has Frankenstein.\n* For Claire-Alice-Bob: Claire has The Great Gatsby, Alice has Ulysses, and Bob has Frankenstein.\n\nNow, let's output the answer to the question:\n\nThe final book that Alice will have at the end of the semester is (A) The Great Gatsby.",
