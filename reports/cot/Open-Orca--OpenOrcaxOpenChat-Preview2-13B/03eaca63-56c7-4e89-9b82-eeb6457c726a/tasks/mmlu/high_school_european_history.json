The people considered all modes of worship in the ancient Roman world as true.\n2. The philosopher considered all modes of worship as equally false.\n3. The magistrate considered all modes of worship as equally useful.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options.\n\n(A) In ancient Rome, religious worship was decentralized and tended to vary with one's social position.\n- This answer states that religious worship was decentralized, which means that it did not have a single central focus or authority. However, the quote does not mention the social position of the people or magistrates influencing their perception of religious worship.\n\n(B) In ancient Rome, religious worship was the source of much social tension and turmoil.\n- The quote does not describe religious worship as the cause of social tension and turmoil. Though Gibbon mentions the various viewpoints of the people, the philosopher, and the magistrate, he does not suggest any significant conflict or turmoil stemming from these views.\n\n(C) In ancient Rome, religious worship was homogeneous and highly centralized.\n- This answer contradicts Gibbon's statement about the various modes of worship in the ancient Roman world being considered true, false, or useful by different groups. It also contradicts Edward Gibbon's interpretation presented in his quotation from The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\n\n(D) In ancient Rome, religious worship was revolutionized by the introduction of Christianity.\n- Given the context provided in the quote, this option is not relevant to the specific question since the quote deals primarily with the ancient Roman world before the advent of Christianity.\n\nBased on the information from the quotation, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n(A) In ancient Rome, religious worship was decentralized and tended to vary with one's social position.",

One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds.

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.",

The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\n(A) De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n(C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n(D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.",
