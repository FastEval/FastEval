            "question": "One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\n(B) admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\n(C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n(D) inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",

            "question": "A state statute provides: \"Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. \" Violation of the statute is made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found\n\n(A) not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(B) not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(C) guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n(D) guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.",

            "question": "A taxpayer was notified by the government that her individual income tax was underpaid by $1,012. 69. The taxpayer retained an attorney to represent her in contesting the assessment. During the preparation of his client's case, the attorney suggested that it might be a good idea if the taxpayer hired an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement for the year in question. Following the attorney's advice, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, who prepared a financial statement, which the attorney referred to at trial. During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testif' about statements that the taxpayer made to him. The accountant's proposed testimony is\n\n(A) inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n(B) inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.\n(C) inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.\n(D) admissible as an admission.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is:\n\n(A) inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\n\nExplanation:\nThe accountant's proposed testimony is about statements made by the taxpayer (the client) to the attorney, which are considered confidential under the attorney-client privilege. This privilege protects the confidential communication between the client and the attorney, and means that the accountant's testimony would be inadmissible due to this protection.",

The resident filed a complaint in federal district court alleging the unconstitutionality of the authenticating requirement. Which of the following, if established, is the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticating requirement?\n\n(A) The resident's petition contained a large number of false signatures.\n(B) A similar authenticating statute was held to be constitutional in another state the previous year.\n(C) The authenticating requirement was necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n(D) Two other candidates had successfully petitioned to have their names included on the ballot.",

            "question": "A defendant was angry at his friend for marrying the defendant's former girlfriend. As the friend was painting his house one afternoon, the defendant fired a shot from his gun at him. Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter. The defendant is subsequently charged with the first-degree murder of the daughter. The relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are as follows:Section 169: Murder in the first degree is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170: Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. Which of the following, if established, would provide the defendant with his best defense?\n\n(A) He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.\n(B) He intended only to wound the friend.\n(C) He was unaware of the elements of malice.\n(D) The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the best defense for the defendant, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter: Since the defendant fired his gun at the friend, it could be argued that he didn't intentionally target the daughter. However, the fact that he shot at his friend with a gun indicates a lack of caution and recklessness that might still make him guilty of the daughter's death.\n\n(B) He intended only to wound the friend: Similarly to option A, even if the defendant intended to only hurt the friend, he still fired at a logical place given that they were standing in the while painting a house. This still presents a risk of harm to others in the vicinity.\n\n(C) He was unaware of the elements of malice: This option suggests the defendant didn't know that he had to intend to take away someone's life in advance. However, this doesn't provide a defense in most jurisdictions as the defendant's intent to kill must be present as a prerequisite for first-degree murder.\n\n(D) The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend: This option presents a possible defense as negligence could be seen as the absence of intent, especially if it can be demonstrated that the defendant didn't intend to take the life of another human being.\n\nTaking these explanations into account, the best defense for the defendant would be:\n\n(D) The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.",

            "question": "The accused made a confession to the police, but his defense attorney needs to find out if the confession is admissible. In which of the following situations would a confession be inadmissible?\n\n(A) The defendant's statement was involuntary.\n(B) The defendant's statement was voluntary.\n(C) The defendant was not in custody when the statement was made.\n(D) The statement was not made in response to a known police interrogation.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine if the confession is inadmissible, we should examine the conditions for each situation:\n\n(A) If the defendant's statement was involuntary, it could be inadmissible because an involuntary confession refers to a confession obtained through coercion, duress, or without adequate understanding. This might be the case if the accused did not understand their rights, the questioning was excessively harsh or coercive, or they were tired, confused, or otherwise compromised.\n\n(B) If the defendant's statement was voluntary, it would likely be admissible. A voluntary confession means that the accused willingly gave the confession without coercion, duress, or undue influence.\n\n(C) If the defendant was not in custody when the statement was made, it could be inadmissible. Generally, a non-custodial statement waived their right to remain silent, as not being in custody does not automatically invoke the right to an attorney or the right against self-incrimination.\n\n(D) If the statement was not made in response to a known police interrogation, it could be inadmissible. The statement is considered involuntary if it is not made in response to a known police interrogation, as it lacks the connection to the ongoing criminal proceedings against the accused.\n\nBased on these reasons, the inadmissible situations would be (A) involuntary confession, (C) the defendant being in non-custody when the statement made, and (D) the statement not made in response to a known police interrogation. The correct answer is therefore:\n\n(A)Hutter's Volkswagen confession was inadmissible because it was involuntary.",

            "question": "A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order\n\n(A) valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\n(B) valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\n(C) invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\n(D) invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the following is not a warrantless search exception, we will analyze each one individually:\n\n(A) Cold pursuit: A cold pursuit is when law enforcement officers continue to track a suspect or follow up on a lead without having an arrest warrant for that specific individual. Although this may seem like an exception to warrantless searches, a cold pursuit rarely leads to a search without a warrant.\n\n(B) Incident to a lawful arrest: This exception allows a law enforcement officer to perform a search when a suspect is under arrest. This is considered a warrantless search because the officer suspects that the individual is involved in criminal activity. This exception is well-established and justified.\n\n(C) Plain view: This exception allows a law enforcement officer who is in plain sight of the object to seize the object if it is in plain view, without a search warrant. This exception is considered valid in cases where an officer comes across incriminating evidence accidentally during a legal surveillance or operation.\n\n(D) Stop and frisk: Stop and frisk is when a law enforcement officer briefly stops a suspect for questioning and uses a limited pat-down to determine if the suspect has weapons or other contraband. This is a legal procedure in certain circumstances and does not constitute a warrantless search.\n\nAfter considering each exception, we can conclude that the warrantless search exception that is not valid is:\n\n(A) Cold pursuit",

If the shopper asserts a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort, the plaintiff will\n\n(A) prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.\n(B) prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.\n(C) not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\n(D) not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.",

            "question": "A man who was separated but never divorced from his first wife, married another woman and lived with her as husband and wife. The man and his purported second wife bought a home together as tenants by the entirety. They lived there together for a few years, when the man was accused and convicted of killing his purported wife. He was given a life sentence. The decedent's estate brought a quiet title action to declare the property forfeited to the decedent on the basis that a murderer cannot benefit from his crime. The trial court awarded the property to the estate. The man appealed from his prison cell. Under the common law, will the appellate court affirm the trial court's decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home?\n\n(A) Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\n(B) Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\n(C) No, the court will as a policy matter recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common.\n(D) No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(B) Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\n\n(Explanation: The man was not separated nor divorced from his first wife when he married his purported second wife, which means he was a bigamist. A bigamist cannot hold or transfer property in good faith or with valid title. So, for the home to not have been marital property with his first wife, it would mean that upon purchase, the home was solely owned by the decedent. The court could then argue that the ill-gotten gains doctrine applies under these circumstances. Therefore, the appellate court affirming the trial court's decision and stripping the man of all ownership rights in the home makes sense.)",
