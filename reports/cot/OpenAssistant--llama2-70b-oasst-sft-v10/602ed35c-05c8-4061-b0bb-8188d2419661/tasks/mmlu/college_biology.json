            "model_answer": "To find the complementary sequence to the given DNA strand, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. The given DNA strand has the sequence 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032.\n2. The complementary sequence will have the opposite orientation, so it will start with 3\u2032 and end with 5\u2032.\n3. To find the complementary base for each position, we need to use the base-pairing rule: A pairs with T (or U in RNA), C pairs with G, and G pairs with C.\n4. Starting from the 3\u2032 end, we can write down the complementary sequence as follows:\n\n   3\u2032 G _ _ _ \n\n5. The first base in the given sequence is C, so its complementary base is G.\n\n   3\u2032 G G _ _ \n\n6. The second base in the given sequence is G, so its complementary base is C.\n\n   3\u2032 G G C _ _ \n\n7. The third base in the given sequence is A, so its complementary base is T (or U in RNA). However, since this is a DNA sequence, we will use T.\n\n   3\u2032 G G C T _ _ \n\n8. The fourth base in the given sequence is T, so its complementary base is A.\n\n   3\u2032 G G C T A _ _ \n\n9. The fifth base in the given sequence is T, so its complementary base is A.\n\n   3\u2032 G G C T A A _ _ \n\n10. The sixth base in the given sequence is G, so its complementary base is C.\n\n   3\u2032 G G C T A A C _ _ \n\n11. Finally, we need to reverse the sequence to get the complementary sequence in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 orientation:\n\n   5\u2032 C A A T G C G G 3\u2032\n\nComparing this sequence with the given options, we can see that it matches with option (D):\n\n(D) 5\u2032 CAA TCG 3\u2032\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\n(D)",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through each statement and evaluate its correctness based on our knowledge of the Golgi apparatus in eukaryotic cells.\n\n(A) It is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum.\nThe Golgi apparatus is an organelle that processes and packages molecules, such as proteins and lipids, for secretion or use within the cell. It is located in the cytoplasm and is composed of flattened sacs called cisternae. The cis face of the Golgi apparatus is the side that faces the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while the trans face is the side that faces the plasma membrane. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\n(B) It is typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face.\nThe Golgi apparatus is indeed associated with small secretory vesicles, which are involved in the transport of molecules out of the cell. These vesicles are typically found near the trans face of the Golgi apparatus, not the cis face. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n(C) Its composite flattened cisternae are continuous with one another.\nThe Golgi apparatus is composed of a series of flattened sacs called cisternae. These cisternae are not continuous with one another, but rather are connected by small channels. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n(D) Glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs prior to the protein's entry into its lumen.\nGlycosylation is the process of adding sugar molecules to proteins and lipids. In the Golgi apparatus, proteins and lipids are modified, including glycosylation, as they move through the cisternae. However, glycosylation of secretory proteins typically occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum before the protein enters the Golgi apparatus. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nBased on our evaluation of each statement, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) It is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\n(A)",

Therefore, antibiotics can interfere with peptidoglycan synthesis.\n\n(B) Protein synthesis: Protein synthesis is a crucial process for all cells, including bacterial cells. Antibiotics can target bacterial protein synthesis, such as by binding to the ribosome and inhibiting translation.

Antibiotics like fluoroquinolones can target DNA synthesis by inhibiting DNA gyrase or topoisomerase, enzymes involved in DNA replication and transcription. Therefore, antibiotics can interfere with DNA synthesis.\n\n(D) Reverse transcriptase: Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of DNA from RNA templates, such as in the process of retroviral replication.
