            "question": "Which of the following is LEAST self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry?\n\n(A) United States\n(B) Japan\n(C) France\n(D) United Kingdom",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the given options is least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry, we need to consider the availability and abundance of natural resources in each country.\n\n(A) United States: The United States is known for its abundant natural resources, including coal, oil, natural gas, and minerals. It is one of the largest producers of oil and natural gas in the world and has vast reserves of coal. Additionally, the United States has a large agricultural sector and is a major producer of food.\n\n(B) Japan: Japan is a resource-poor country and relies heavily on imports to meet its energy and raw material needs. It has limited domestic resources, including coal, oil, and natural gas, and must import the majority of its energy needs from other countries. Japan also has a small agricultural sector and relies on imports for much of its food.\n\n(C) France: France has some natural resources, including coal, oil, and natural gas, but its reserves are relatively limited. It is a net importer of energy and relies heavily on nuclear power for its electricity generation. France also has a significant agricultural sector and is a major producer of food.\n\n(D) United Kingdom: The United Kingdom has limited natural resources, including oil and natural gas, and relies heavily on imports to meet its energy needs. It has a small agricultural sector and is a net importer of food.\n\nBased on this information, Japan (B) is the least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry, as it relies heavily on imports for both energy and food.",

            "question": "When a new fashion design is introduced globally, the information initially travels through a process known as\n\n(A) contagious diffusion\n(B) relocation diffusion\n(C) innovative diffusion\n(D) hierarchical diffusion",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what each of these terms mean:\n\n(A) Contagious diffusion: This is a type of diffusion where a new idea or innovation spreads rapidly and widely through a population. It is often used to describe the spread of diseases or rumors.\n\n(B) Relocation diffusion: This is a type of diffusion where a new idea or innovation spreads through a population as people move from one location to another. It is often used to describe the spread of cultural practices or technologies.\n\n(C) Innovative diffusion: This is a type of diffusion where a new idea or innovation spreads through a population as people adopt it and adapt it to their own needs and preferences. It is often used to describe the spread of new technologies or business practices.\n\n(D) Hierarchical diffusion: This is a type of diffusion where a new idea or innovation spreads through a population from the top down, starting with the most influential or powerful individuals or groups and then spreading to others. It is often used to describe the spread of new ideas or policies within an organization.\n\nNow, let's think about how new fashion designs are typically introduced and spread globally. Fashion designers often introduce new designs through runway shows, fashion magazines, and online platforms. These designs are then adopted and adapted by fashion-forward individuals, who may share them with their friends and followers on social media. As more people see and adopt the new designs, they spread rapidly and widely through the population.\n\nBased on this understanding, the process through which new fashion designs are introduced globally is most closely aligned with:\n\n(A) contagious diffusion",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation.\n\nMyrdal's theory of cumulative causation is a framework for understanding how economic development can be self-reinforcing, leading to a widening gap between regions that are initially advantaged or disadvantaged. According to this theory, regions that start with certain advantages (such as access to resources, markets, or infrastructure) tend to attract more investment, labor, and capital, which further increases their advantages and leads to even more growth and prosperity. On the other hand, regions that are initially disadvantaged tend to lose out on investment, labor, and capital, which further exacerbates their disadvantages and leads to stagnation or decline.\n\nNow let's examine each of the statements:\n\n(A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.\nThis statement suggests that trade leads to a more equal distribution of wealth between regions, which is not consistent with Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation, which predicts that regions with initial advantages will continue to benefit at the expense of regions with initial disadvantages.\n\n(B) The core will always dominate the periphery.\nThis statement is consistent with Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation, which suggests that the core (advantaged) regions will continue to benefit at the expense of the periphery (disadvantaged) regions.\n\n(C) Growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery.\nThis statement is also consistent with Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation, which suggests that the growth and prosperity of the core regions comes at the expense of the periphery regions.\n\n(D) Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade.\nThis statement is consistent with Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation, which suggests that regions with initial advantages will continue to benefit as they attract more investment, labor, and capital.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation is:\n\n(A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.",

World cities are global centers of economic activity and often serve as headquarters for many large corporations.\n\n(B) World cities are well connected to secondary-level world cities.\nThis statement is also true. World cities are typically well-connected to other major cities around the world, both directly and through secondary-level cities.\n\n(C) World cities contain many offices of multinational organizations.\nThis statement is true as well. World cities often host the headquarters or regional offices of international organizations, such as the United Nations or the World Bank.\n\n(D) World cities are found only in the northern and western hemispheres.\nThis statement is false. World cities are located in various parts of the world, including the southern and eastern hemispheres.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through each option and evaluate whether it fits the description of \"the concentration of production activities and people spatially to benefit everyone.\"\n\n(A) The substitution principle refers to the idea that as the price of one good increases, consumers will substitute it with another good. This doesn't fit the description of spatial concentration of production and people.\n\n(B) Deglomeration refers to the process of dispersing or spreading out production activities and people. This is the opposite of concentrating them spatially.\n\n(C) Agglomeration refers to the concentration of production activities and people in a specific location, which can lead to benefits such as economies of scale, increased competition, and better access to resources and infrastructure. This fits the description given in the question.\n\n(D) Infrastructure refers to the physical systems and structures that support a community or economy, such as transportation, communication, and energy networks. While infrastructure can facilitate the concentration of production activities and people, it is not the process of concentration itself.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) agglomeration.",

Periphery countries are typically less economically developed and have a lower standard of living compared to core countries. They often rely heavily on agriculture, mining, and other primary economic activities.\n\nNow let's examine each of the answer choices:\n\n(A) Primary activities: These are activities related to the extraction and production of raw materials, such as agriculture, mining, and forestry. Given that periphery countries often rely heavily on these activities, this option seems like a strong possibility.\n\n(B) Secondary activities: These are activities related to the manufacturing and processing of goods, such as factories and assembly plants. While periphery countries may have some secondary activities, they are typically less developed in this area compared to core countries.\n\n(C) Tertiary activities: These are activities related to services, such as retail, healthcare, and education. While periphery countries do have tertiary activities, they often have a smaller service sector compared to core countries.\n\n(D) Quaternary activities: These are activities related to knowledge-based services, such as research, consulting, and information technology.
