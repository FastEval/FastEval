Find the whole number by rounding down the decimal number. In this case, 4.95 rounds down to 4.\n2. Subtract the whole number from the decimal number to get the remaining fractional part. In this case, 4.95 - 4 = 0.95.\n3. Convert the remaining fractional part to a fraction by dividing it by 1. In this case, 0.95 \u00f7 1 = 0.95.\n4. Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 95 and 100 is 5, so we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 5.

Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 34 and 4 is 4, so we divide both numbers by 4: 34 \u00f7 4 = 8 and 4 \u00f7 4 = 1.\n\nSo the improper fraction in simplest form is 8 over 1.
