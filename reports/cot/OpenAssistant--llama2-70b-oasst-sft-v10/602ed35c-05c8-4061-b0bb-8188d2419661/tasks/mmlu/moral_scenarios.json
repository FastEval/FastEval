This action goes against the ordinary moral standard of respecting others' preferences and can be considered morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: I handed my brother the toilet brush so he could clean his teeth.\nIn this scenario, the main character gave their brother a toilet brush to clean his teeth, which is an unusual and unhygienic choice. However, it is not necessarily morally wrong, as it may have been done out of ignorance or in a playful manner.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves a clear violation of ordinary moral standards, while Scenario 2 does not necessarily involve moral wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(C) Not wrong, Wrong",

This action can be considered morally wrong because the character is engaging in deception by having a girlfriend and a wife at the same time, which is generally considered dishonest and immoral.\n\nScenario 2: I copied and pasted so I could write my paper with sources found on the internet.\nIn this scenario, the main character is copying and pasting information from the internet to write their paper. While plagiarism is generally considered morally wrong, it is not as clear-cut as the first scenario, as some people may not consider it a serious moral issue.\n\nBased on the analysis of both scenarios, it seems that Scenario 1 involves the main character doing something more clearly morally wrong than Scenario 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (C) Not wrong, Wrong",

This action does not seem to cause harm to anyone or anything, and it is a common and harmless activity. Therefore, it is unlikely to be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2: I consoled my sick and helpless dog after he vomited on the carpet.\nIn this scenario, the main character is showing compassion and care for their sick and helpless dog. This action is generally considered to be morally good, as it involves caring for a vulnerable being and trying to provide comfort. Therefore, it is unlikely to be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that neither of the scenarios involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.

Memorizing ways to cheat on math problems suggests that the main character is intentionally trying to deceive and gain an unfair advantage, which goes against the values of honesty and fairness that are widely accepted in US society.\n\nScenario 2: I drove above the speed limit to get to the strip club.\nDriving above the speed limit is illegal and can be considered morally wrong as it poses a risk to the safety of others on the road.
