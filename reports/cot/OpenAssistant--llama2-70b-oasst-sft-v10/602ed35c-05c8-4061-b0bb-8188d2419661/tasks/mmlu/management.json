            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what key management skills are typically involved in planning.\n\nPlanning is an essential part of management, and it requires several key skills to be effective.

Analytical skills: The ability to analyze data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on that analysis.\n3. Communication skills: The ability to effectively communicate plans, ideas, and information to others.\n\nNow let's examine the options provided:\n\n(A) Conceptual skills: As mentioned earlier, conceptual skills are important for planning.\n(B) Analytical skills: Analytical skills are also important for planning, as they help managers make data-driven decisions.\n(C) IT and computing skills: While IT and computing skills can be useful in certain management roles, they are not a key management skill specifically related to planning.\n(D) Communication skills: Communication skills are crucial for planning, as they allow managers to effectively convey their plans and ideas to others.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n(C) IT and computing skills",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each of the given options:\n\n(A) Team culture: This type of culture focuses on collaboration and cooperation among team members to achieve a common goal. While workers' acceptance of change may be present in a team culture, it is not the defining characteristic.\n\n(B) Collaborative culture: Similar to team culture, a collaborative culture emphasizes working together and sharing ideas and resources. Acceptance of change may be more likely in a collaborative culture, but again, it is not the defining characteristic.\n\n(C) Group culture: This type of culture refers to the shared values, norms, and behaviors of a group of people. Workers' acceptance of change could be a part of a group culture, but it is not the defining feature.\n\n(D) Collective culture: A collective culture places emphasis on the group as a whole, rather than on individual achievements or desires. In a collective culture, workers are more likely to accept change if it is seen as beneficial for the group, rather than just for themselves.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n(D) Collective culture",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what a corporate social responsibility (CSR) framework is. CSR refers to the way a company takes responsibility for its impact on society and the environment. A CSR framework typically includes policies and practices that address issues such as environmental sustainability, human rights, labor standards, and community involvement.\n\nNow let's examine each of the given options:\n\n(A) Retaining the status quo: This option suggests maintaining the current state of affairs without making any changes. However, CSR frameworks are designed to address social and environmental issues, which often require companies to make changes to their practices. Therefore, this option is not a characteristic of a CSR framework.\n\n(B) Understanding society: This option suggests that a CSR framework involves understanding the needs and concerns of society. This is indeed a characteristic of a CSR framework, as companies need to understand the social and environmental impacts of their operations in order to address them effectively.\n\n(C) Harnessing diversity: This option suggests that a CSR framework involves leveraging the benefits of diversity. While diversity can be an important aspect of CSR, it is not a defining characteristic of a CSR framework.\n\n(D) Building capacity: This option suggests that a CSR framework involves building the ability of an organization or community to address social and environmental issues. While building capacity can be an outcome of CSR efforts, it is not a defining characteristic of a CSR framework.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n(A) Retaining the status quo",

While he did write about the importance of specialization and organization in economic production, he is not primarily associated with bureaucratic structures.\n\n(D) Mary Parker Follett: Follett is a management theorist who wrote about the importance of collaboration and group dynamics in organizations.

An acquisition is the process of one company buying another company, typically with the intention of integrating the acquired company's operations and assets into its own business.\n\nNow let's evaluate each of the given options:\n\n(A) Two equal partners decide to work together.\nThis option describes a collaboration or partnership between two equal partners, but it does not involve one company buying another. Therefore, this is not an acquisition.\n\n(B) Two equal partners share resources.\nThis option also describes a collaboration or partnership between two equal partners, with the added detail that they are sharing resources. Again, this does not involve one company buying another, so it is not an acquisition.\n\n(C) Two unequal partners join together.\nThis option describes a situation where two unequal partners come together, but it does not specify how they are joining together. It is possible that this could be an acquisition if one partner is buying the other, but it is not clear from this option alone.\n\n(D) Two unequal partners become one after a buyout.\nThis option clearly describes an acquisition, as it involves one company buying another and the two partners becoming one entity.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Two unequal partners become one after a buyout.",
