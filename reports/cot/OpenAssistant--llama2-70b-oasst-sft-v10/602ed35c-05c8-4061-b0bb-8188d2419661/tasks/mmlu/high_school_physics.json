            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\nI. The ball's speed is zero at the highest point.\n\nThis statement is false. When a whiffle ball is tossed straight up and reaches its highest point, it still has some upward velocity due to the initial toss. Even though the velocity is decreasing as the ball rises against gravity, it does not become zero until the ball reaches the highest point and starts falling back down.\n\nII. The ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point.\n\nThis statement is true. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity over time. At the highest point, the ball's velocity is momentarily constant (not changing), so the rate of change of velocity is zero, and therefore, the acceleration is zero.\n\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\n\nThis statement is false. Due to air resistance, the ball will experience a drag force that opposes its upward motion, causing it to slow down as it rises. However, when the ball falls back down, it is falling with the force of gravity and the drag force acting in the same direction, so the net force is greater, and the ball falls faster than it rose. Therefore, the time it takes for the ball to fall back down is less than the time it took to rise to the highest point.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) II only",
