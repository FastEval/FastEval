            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to look at the available evidence on the relationship between bariatric surgery and the reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that bariatric surgery can lead to significant improvements in type 2 diabetes in obese individuals. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2017 found that bariatric surgery was associated with a 40% to 80% reduction in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in obese individuals.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the exact reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of surgery, the patient's age, and the presence of other health conditions.\n\nBased on the available evidence, the answer to the question is:\n\n(A) 80-90%",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's examine each statement and evaluate its accuracy based on scientific evidence:\n\n(A) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations.\n\nStudies have shown that replacing saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can lead to a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations. This is because n-6 PUFAs can compete with saturated fatty acids for incorporation into cell membranes, leading to a decrease in the proportion of saturated fatty acids in the membranes and a subsequent reduction in plasma triglyceride levels.\n\n(B) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol.\n\nMonounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are generally considered to have a neutral or slightly beneficial effect on LDL cholesterol levels. Some studies have shown that replacing saturated fatty acids with MUFAs can lead to a modest reduction in LDL cholesterol levels, while other studies have shown no significant effect. Therefore, this statement is not entirely accurate.\n\n(C) Consumption of soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant increase in LDL cholesterol.\n\nSoluble dietary fiber and plant stanols/sterols are known to have cholesterol-lowering effects. They can bind to bile acids in the intestine and prevent their reabsorption, leading to a decrease in cholesterol levels in the blood. Therefore, this statement is not accurate.\n\n(D) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with decreased LDL and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations.\n\nReplacing saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate can lead to a decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, but it can also lead to an increase in plasma triglyceride levels. This is because carbohydrates are quickly digested and absorbed, leading to a rapid increase in blood glucose levels. The body responds by producing insulin, which promotes the storage of glucose as glycogen in the liver and muscles. When the capacity for glycogen storage is exceeded, the excess glucose is converted into fatty acids and stored as triglycerides in the liver and adipose tissue. Therefore, this statement is partially accurate.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct statement is:\n\n(A) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations.\n\n(A)",

All of the compounds listed are found in plant-based foods, and they are all types of phytonutrients. Phytonutrients are natural chemicals found in plants that have various health benefits.\n\n(C) They are all vitamins: Vitamins are essential nutrients that the body needs in small amounts to function properly.

In general, however, reheating canned vegetables is not likely to cause significant losses of vitamin C.\n\n(C) Losses of vitamin C are much higher for most canned fruits than those for canned vegetables\n\nThis statement is generally true. Canned fruits are typically more acidic than canned vegetables, and acidic environments can accelerate the degradation of vitamin C. Additionally, canned fruits are often heated for longer periods during the canning process, which can also contribute to the loss of vitamin C.\n\n(D) Losses of vitamin C in canned foods during storage at ambient temperature tend to be small\n\nThis statement is also generally true. While vitamin C can be lost during the canning process, losses during storage at ambient temperature are typically small. However, it is important to note that the length of time a canned food is stored can also affect the amount of vitamin C that is lost.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Losses of vitamin C are much higher for most canned fruits than those for canned vegetables",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's examine each statement and evaluate its correctness based on our knowledge of gastro-intestinal absorption.\n\n(A) The absorption of glucose is associated with sodium uptake.\nThis statement is correct. The absorption of glucose in the GI tract is facilitated by a process called secondary active transport, which involves the co-transport of glucose and sodium ions across the intestinal epithelial cells. This process is mediated by a transporter called SGLT1 (sodium-glucose co-transporter 1).\n\n(B) Fructose is absorbed more rapidly than glucose.\nThis statement is incorrect. Fructose and glucose are absorbed at similar rates in the GI tract. Fructose is absorbed by a different transporter called GLUT5, which is also present in the brush border membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. Although fructose absorption is not directly coupled to sodium uptake like glucose absorption, it still occurs efficiently in the small intestine.\n\n(C) Galactose and fructose are absorbed by the same transporter at the brush border membrane.\nThis statement is incorrect. As mentioned earlier, fructose is absorbed by the transporter GLUT5, while galactose is absorbed by a different transporter called GLUT2. Although both transporters are present in the brush border membrane, they are responsible for the absorption of different sugars.\n\n(D) Most water absorption along the GI tract occurs in the colon.\nThis statement is incorrect. The majority of water absorption in the GI tract occurs in the small intestine, particularly in the jejunum and ileum. The colon does play a role in water absorption, but it is primarily responsible for the absorption of electrolytes and the formation of feces.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most correct statement about absorption from the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract is:\n\n(A) The absorption of glucose is associated with sodium uptake.\n\n(A)",
