            "model_answer": "To determine which of Swift's segments are required to be separately disclosed in its December 31 year 2 financial statements, we need to consider the significance of each segment's revenue and profit (loss) relative to the total revenue and profit (loss) of the company.\n\nSegment A has revenue of $42,000 and profit of $12,000. Segment B has revenue of $121,000 and profit of $65,000. Segment C has revenue of $14,000 and a loss of $3,000. The total revenue for the company is $177,000 and the total profit is $74,000.\n\nWe can calculate the percentage of total revenue and profit (loss) for each segment as follows:\n\nSegment A:\nRevenue percentage = (Segment A revenue / Total revenue) x 100 = (42 / 177) x 100 = 23.7%\nProfit percentage = (Segment A profit / Total profit) x 100 = (12 / 74) x 100 = 16.2%\n\nSegment B:\nRevenue percentage = (Segment B revenue / Total revenue) x 100 = (121 / 177) x 100 = 68.3%\nProfit percentage = (Segment B profit / Total profit) x 100 = (65 / 74) x 100 = 87.8%\n\nSegment C:\nRevenue percentage = (Segment C revenue / Total revenue) x 100 = (14 / 177) x 100 = 7.9%\nProfit percentage = (Segment C loss / Total profit) x 100 = (-3 / 74) x 100 = -4.0%\n\nAccording to the significance of revenue and profit (loss), we can see that:\n\nSegment A has a revenue percentage of 23.7% and a profit percentage of 16.2%.\nSegment B has a revenue percentage of 68.3% and a profit percentage of 87.8%.\nSegment C has a revenue percentage of 7.9% and a profit percentage of -4.0%.\n\nSince both the revenue and profit (loss) percentages for Segment A are greater than 10%, it is considered a reportable segment and must be separately disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nSegment B also has both revenue and profit (loss) percentages greater than 10%, so it is also considered a reportable segment and must be separately disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nSegment C, however, has both revenue and profit (loss) percentages less than 10%, so it is not considered a reportable segment and does not need to be separately disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) A and B only.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through each option step-by-step and evaluate whether it is a right that a holder of a public corporation's cumulative preferred stock is always entitled to:\n\n(A) Conversion of the preferred stock into common stock:\nCumulative preferred stock typically does not have a conversion feature that allows it to be converted into common stock. This is because preferred stock is a separate class of stock that has different rights and characteristics compared to common stock. Therefore, this option is not a right that holders of cumulative preferred stock are always entitled to.\n\n(B) Voting rights:\nPreferred stock generally does not have voting rights, as voting rights are typically associated with common stock. However, there may be some limited circumstances where preferred stockholders have voting rights, such as in the case of a major corporate action that requires approval by all shareholders. Nonetheless, voting rights are not a standard right for holders of cumulative preferred stock.\n\n(C) Dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid:\nCumulative preferred stock is called \"cumulative\" because any unpaid dividends accumulate over time and must be paid before common stockholders can receive dividends. This means that if a corporation does not pay dividends in a particular year, the unpaid dividends become a liability that must be paid to preferred stockholders before any dividends can be paid to common stockholders. Therefore, holders of cumulative preferred stock are always entitled to dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid.\n\n(D) Guaranteed dividends:\nWhile cumulative preferred stock does provide a priority for dividend payments, it does not guarantee that dividends will be paid. A corporation may not have sufficient earnings or cash flow to pay dividends, in which case preferred stockholders may not receive any dividends. Therefore, holders of cumulative preferred stock are not always entitled to guaranteed dividends.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid.",
