            "model_answer": "To estimate the number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Estimate the number of households in the United States.\n2. Estimate the average number of movies watched per household per year.\n3. Multiply the two estimates to get the total number of movies watched.\n\nStep 1: According to the United States Census Bureau, there were approximately 128 million households in the United States in 2021.\n\nStep 2: It's difficult to determine an exact average number of movies watched per household per year, as it varies depending on factors such as age, income, and access to streaming services. However, for the sake of estimation, let's assume an average of 10 movies watched per household per year.\n\nStep 3: Multiplying the number of households by the average number of movies watched per household, we get:\n\n128 million households * 10 movies/household = 1.28 billion movies\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) 2,000,000,000",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to estimate the amount of ice wasted by Americans each year and then calculate the energy contained in that ice.\n\nStep 1: Estimate the amount of ice wasted\nLet's assume that the average American wastes 100 grams of ice per day (this is just an estimate, the actual amount may vary). There are approximately 300 million Americans, so the total amount of ice wasted by Americans each year would be:\n\n100 g/day * 300 million Americans * 365 days/year = 10.95 * 10^9 kg/year\n\nStep 2: Calculate the energy contained in the ice\nThe energy contained in ice can be estimated using the formula:\n\nE = m * c * \u0394T\n\nwhere E is the energy (in joules), m is the mass of the ice (in kg), c is the specific heat capacity of ice (2.19 J/g\u00b7\u00b0C), and \u0394T is the change in temperature (in \u00b0C).\n\nAssuming that the initial temperature of the ice is 0 \u00b0C and the final temperature is the ambient temperature (let's say 25 \u00b0C), we have:\n\n\u0394T = 25 \u00b0C - 0 \u00b0C = 25 \u00b0C\n\nSo the energy contained in the ice wasted by Americans each year would be:\n\nE = 10.95 * 10^9 kg/year * 2.19 J/g\u00b7\u00b0C * 25 \u00b0C = 6.22 * 10^11 J/year\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) 6*10^11 J",
