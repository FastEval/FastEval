            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through each option and evaluate its relevance to the study by Brown & Harris (1978) on depression.\n\n(A) women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support\nThis option suggests that the study found a relationship between women's stress levels and their social support. While social support is an important factor in mental health, it is not mentioned in the question that the study specifically focused on women's stress levels.\n\n(B) self-reported depression is highest amongst men and the relatively affluent\nThis option states that the study found that men and relatively affluent individuals have the highest self-reported depression rates. However, this option does not align with the known fact that women generally have higher rates of diagnosed depression than men.\n\n(C) men and women have fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression\nThis option suggests that the study found similar levels of diagnosed depression in men and women. This statement is in line with the known fact that women have higher rates of diagnosed depression than men, but it does not specify any specific factor that might contribute to this difference.\n\n(D) men are more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles\nThis option proposes that the study found that conventional gender roles make men more vulnerable to depression. While gender roles can have an impact on mental health, this option does not align with the known fact that women generally have higher rates of diagnosed depression than men.\n\nBased on the evaluation of each option, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n(C) men and women have fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's examine each option and determine if it is considered a new form of community.\n\n(A) Ethnic communities are groups of people who share a common cultural background, language, and history. They have existed for centuries and are not considered a new form of community.\n\n(B) Gay villages are areas in large cities where a significant number of LGBTQ+ people live and socialize. These communities have formed in response to discrimination and a desire for a sense of belonging. They are considered a relatively new form of community.\n\n(C) Sociological communities refer to groups of people who share common interests, values, and social norms. These communities can be formed by unpopular lecturers or any other group of people with shared interests. They are considered a new form of community.\n\n(D) Virtual communities are online groups of people who share common interests, hobbies, or goals. They have become more prevalent with the rise of the internet and social media and are considered a new form of community.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n(A) ethnic communities",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what the embourgeoisement thesis is. The embourgeoisement thesis is a theory in sociology that suggests that the working class is becoming more like the middle class in terms of values, lifestyle, and social status.\n\nNow let's examine each of the answer choices:\n\n(A) This option suggests that capitalists are being replaced by salaried managers. While this might be a trend in some industries, it is not the central idea of the embourgeoisement thesis.\n\n(B) This option states that the affluent working class is adopting middle-class values and ways of life. This is consistent with the idea of embourgeoisement, which suggests that the working class is becoming more like the middle class.\n\n(C) This option talks about the deskilling of white-collar occupations due to new technologies. While this might be a trend in some industries, it is not directly related to the embourgeoisement thesis.\n\n(D) This option suggests that the class structure has fragmented and there are no longer any distinct social classes. While the embourgeoisement thesis does suggest some blurring of class boundaries, it does not suggest that distinct social classes no longer exist.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) the affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life",

However, Weber's ideal types are based on the motivations behind the action, not the emotions associated with it.\n\n(C) effective: This term refers to the outcome or result of an action, rather than the motivation behind it.

The Office for National Statistics reports that the number of drug-related deaths in England and Wales has increased in recent years, and drug use is now a problem across all age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\n(B) The most commonly used recreational drug is Ecstasy:\n\nAccording to the Home Office's Drug Misuse: Findings from the 2019/20 Crime Survey for England and Wales, the most commonly used recreational drug in Britain is cannabis, followed by cocaine and ecstasy. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\n(C) Teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys:\n\nThe Home Office's Drug Misuse: Findings from the 2019/20 Crime Survey for England and Wales reports that overall, men are more likely to have used drugs than women. However, the gender gap has narrowed in recent years, and there is evidence to suggest that teenage girls are now more likely to experiment with drugs than teenage boys.\n\n(D) Despite a series of moral panics, the use of illegal drugs is very rare:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the number of drug-related deaths in England and Wales has increased in recent years, and drug use is now a problem across all age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds.

While this could be a factor, it does not seem to be the main focus of the study.\n\n(C) \"exciting gadgets like the hoover and electric iron were invented\" - This option implies that technological advancements made housework easier and more appealing to men. While technology may have played a role, it is unlikely to be the primary factor in the study's findings.\n\n(D) \"they were unemployed or both partners worked full time\" - This option suggests that men did more housework when they were not working or when both partners had full-time jobs.
