He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&\u2026[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&\u2026.\nOne day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&\u2026.She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&\u2026.We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.\"\n\"Well, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide to him, \"when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?\"\n\"I am still of my first opinion,\" answered Pangloss, \"for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis.\"\nVoltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759\nCandide's statement that \"everything always happens for the best\" can be seen as a reflection of the Enlightenment belief that\n\n(A) society can be perfected if you apply the scientific method to it\n(B) a people without a strong central authority are doomed to live in a state of nature\n(C) the only purpose of a government is to secure the rights of life, liberty, and property\n(D) only free markets can lead nations to wealth and happiness",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nFirst we must remark that the cosmos is spherical in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one may say that Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos was based on\n\n(A) observation and induction\n(B) ancient textual authority\n(C) experimentation\n(D) deduction from first principles",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos, let's examine the passage step-by-step:\n\n1. The passage begins by stating that the cosmos is spherical in form, and provides several reasons why this is the case. These reasons include the perfection and completeness of the spherical form, the fact that heavenly bodies appear to be spherical, and the tendency of fluid bodies to assume a spherical shape.\n\n2. The passage then moves on to discuss the spherical nature of the Earth, noting that it presses from all sides upon its center, despite the presence of mountains and valleys.\n\n3. Finally, the passage considers the possibility of movement in the universe and the position of the Earth in relation to the heavens. It acknowledges that the majority of authors believe the Earth is stationary at the center of the universe, but suggests that this question is not yet settled and should be carefully considered.\n\nBased on this analysis, Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos seems to be based on:\n\n(A) observation and induction - The passage provides several reasons for the spherical shape of the cosmos, including observations of heavenly bodies and the behavior of fluid bodies.\n\n(D) deduction from first principles - The passage also employs logical reasoning to deduce that the spherical form is the most complete and well-suited to contain and preserve everything in the universe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) observation and induction and (D) deduction from first principles.",

            "model_answer": "To answer the question, let's analyze the passage step-by-step:\n\n1. The passage is from the Edict of Nantes, issued by Henry IV of France in 1598.\n2. The edict aims to establish peace and forget the past troubles between the Catholic and Protestant (Reformed) religions.\n3. It orders the restoration of the Catholic religion in all places where it was interrupted and allows Protestants to live and practice their religion freely without being molested or compelled to do anything against their consciences.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can infer the following:\n\n- Henry IV was trying to establish peace between Catholics and Protestants, which suggests that there was religious conflict in France prior to 1598.\n- The edict does not explicitly state Henry IV's personal religious beliefs.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) prior to 1598, France was stricken with religious conflict",
