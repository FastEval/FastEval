            "model_answer": "To determine the most strongly reflected wavelength, we need to consider the phenomenon of interference. When light passes through the oil layer and then the water layer, it experiences two reflections: one at the oil-water interface and another at the water-air interface. The combination of these reflections can lead to constructive or destructive interference, depending on the wavelength of light.\n\nLet's consider the thickness of the oil layer to be d = 500 nm. The refractive index of oil is n1 = 1.5, and the refractive index of water is n2 = 1.33.\n\nWhen light passes through the oil layer, it experiences a phase shift of:\n\n\u03c61 = 2\u03c0nd/\u03bb\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength of light.\n\nSimilarly, when light passes through the water layer, it experiences a phase shift of:\n\n\u03c62 = 2\u03c0n2d/\u03bb\n\nThe total phase shift experienced by the light is the sum of \u03c61 and \u03c62:\n\n\u03c6_total = \u03c61 + \u03c62\n\nFor constructive interference, the total phase shift should be an integer multiple of 2\u03c0, i.e., \u03c6_total = 2\u03c0m, where m is an integer.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \u03c61 and \u03c62 into \u03c6_total, we get:\n\n\u03c6_total = 2\u03c0(m/n1 + m/n2)d/\u03bb\n\nSimplifying this expression, we have:\n\n\u03c6_total = 2\u03c0m(n1 + n2)/n1n2d/\u03bb\n\nNow, we need to find the wavelength \u03bb for which the total phase shift is an integer multiple of 2\u03c0. Rearranging the above equation, we get:\n\n\u03bb = (2\u03c0m(n1 + n2)/n1n2d)\n\nSince m is an integer, we can see that the wavelength \u03bb that satisfies this condition is inversely proportional to the product of the refractive indices (n1n2).\n\nComparing the given options:\n\n(A) 500 nm\n(B) 550 nm\n(C) 600 nm\n(D) 650 nm\n\nWe can see that the wavelength that corresponds to the lowest value of n1n2 is 500 nm.

So, if the temperature is lower by 3%, the speed of sound will also be lower by 3%.\n\nLet's assume that the original speed of sound at 20\u00b0C is v. Then, the new speed of sound at the lower temperature will be (1 - 0.03)v = 0.97v.\n\nThe length of the pipe is L, and the frequency of resonance is f. The relationship between these variables is given by the formula:\n\nv = 2Lf\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to get f in terms of v and L:\n\nf = v/(2L)\n\nNow, we know that the original frequency of resonance at 20\u00b0C is 440 Hz, and the original speed of sound is v. We also know that the new speed of sound is 0.97v. We can plug these values into the formula for f to find the new frequency of resonance:\n\nf_new = (0.97v)/(2L)\n\nf_new = 0.485v/(2L)\n\nSince we know that the original frequency of resonance was 440 Hz, we can set f_new equal to 440 Hz and solve for v:\n\n440 = 0.485v/(2L)\n\nv = (440 * 2L) / 0.485\n\nv = 976L / 0.485\n\nNow that we have the original speed of sound in terms of L, we can find the new speed of sound using the formula:\n\nv_new = 0.97v\n\nv_new = 0.97 * (976L / 0.485)\n\nv_new = 950.4L / 0.485\n\nWe can now plug the new speed of sound back into the formula for f to find the new frequency of resonance:\n\nf_new = v_new/(2L)\n\nf_new = (950.4L / 0.485)/(2L)\n\nf_new = 475.2 / 0.2425\n\nf_new = 2000 / 1.2125\n\nf_new = 1648.8 Hz\n\nHowever, this frequency is not listed as one of the answer choices.
