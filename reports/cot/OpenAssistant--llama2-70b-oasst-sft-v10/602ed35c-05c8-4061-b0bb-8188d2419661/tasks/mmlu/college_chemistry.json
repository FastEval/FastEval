            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what optical isomerism is and how it relates to complexes containing achiral ligands.\n\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a non-superimposable mirror image, also known as an enantiomer. In the case of coordination complexes, optical isomerism can occur when the ligands around the metal center are different and can be arranged in different ways, leading to different spatial orientations of the ligands.\n\nNow let's examine each of the given statements:\n\n(A) Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\nThis statement is false. Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism even if all four ligands are not identical. In fact, square planar complexes can display optical isomerism when two of the four ligands are different, leading to two possible enantiomers.\n\n(B) Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\nThis statement is also false. Tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism when the four ligands are different, leading to two possible enantiomers.\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\nThis statement is true. Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different, leading to two possible enantiomers.\n\n(D) Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\nThis statement is false. Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism when any two of the six ligands are different, leading to two possible enantiomers.\n\nBased on the above explanations, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the number of allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. The atomic number (Z) of manganese (Mn) is 25, and the mass number (A) of the 55Mn nuclide is 55.\n\n2. The number of protons in the nucleus of a manganese atom is 25, and the number of neutrons in the nucleus of the 55Mn nuclide is 55 - 25 = 30.\n\n3. The total number of energy levels in an atom is given by the formula: n = 2(Z + 1)\n\n4. Substituting the value of Z for manganese (25), we get: n = 2(25 + 1) = 2(26) = 52\n\n5. However, we need to consider that the 55Mn nuclide has 30 neutrons, which means that some of the energy levels are occupied by neutrons.\n\n6. To find the number of energy levels available for protons, we need to subtract the number of neutrons from the total number of energy levels: n_protons = n - N\n\n7. Substituting the values of n and N (number of neutrons) for the 55Mn nuclide, we get: n_protons = 52 - 30 = 22\n\n8. Since the number of protons in the nucleus of a manganese atom is 25, we need to subtract this number from the number of available energy levels for protons to find the number of allowed energy levels: n_allowed = n_protons - Z\n\n9. Substituting the value of Z for manganese (25) and n_protons (22), we get: n_allowed = 22 - 25 = -3\n\nSince the number of allowed energy levels cannot be negative, this means that all energy levels are occupied in the 55Mn nuclide, and there are no allowed energy levels available.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(E) None of the above",
