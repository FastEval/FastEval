However, as research progressed, it became clear that this estimate was too high.\n\nCurrent estimates for the number of human protein-coding genes are in the range of 19,000-20,000 (option B). This estimate is based on more accurate and comprehensive sequencing of the human genome and the identification of functional protein-coding genes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) 19,000\u201320,000",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the most common mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that causes cystic fibrosis.\n\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. The CFTR gene is responsible for producing a protein that helps regulate the movement of salt and water in and out of cells. A mutation in this gene can cause the protein to be defective, leading to the symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\n\nThe most common mutation in the CFTR gene that causes cystic fibrosis is known as the delta F508 mutation.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided and use our knowledge of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and body mass index (BMI) to determine which of the given options is most accurate.\n\nGWAS are studies that look for associations between common genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and traits like BMI. Heritability refers to the proportion of variation in a trait that can be explained by genetic factors, and twin and family studies have estimated that the heritability of BMI is greater than 50%.\n\nDespite this high heritability, it has been observed that known SNPs explain only a small proportion of the variation in BMI. According to various GWAS studies, the proportion of variation explained by known SNPs is estimated to be around 5-10%.\n\nGiven this information, we can eliminate options (B) and (D) as they suggest an even smaller proportion of variation explained by SNPs than what is generally observed. Between options (A) and (C), the latter is closer to the estimated range of 5-10%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(C) only 13%",

If PKU is not treated, high levels of phenylalanine can build up in the body, causing intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and other serious health issues.\n\nIf a mother with PKU does not follow a strict low-phenylalanine diet during pregnancy, her baby is at risk of developing a condition called maternal PKU syndrome.

This option aligns with the definition of QTL analysis, as it involves identifying chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross.\n\n(B) determine which genes are expressed at a developmental stage\nThis option is related to gene expression analysis, which involves studying the levels of mRNA or protein produced by genes during a specific developmental stage. QTL analysis, however, focuses on identifying genetic loci associated with quantitative traits, not gene expression.\n\n(C) map genes in bacterial viruses\nThis option is related to gene mapping, which involves determining the specific location of genes on a chromosome or genome. While QTL analysis involves mapping genetic loci, it is not specifically focused on mapping genes in bacterial viruses.\n\n(D) identify RNA polymerase binding sites\nThis option is related to transcriptional regulation, which involves studying how RNA polymerase binds to specific sites on DNA to initiate transcription.

This transfer of genetic material occurs through a small circular DNA molecule called the F factor, which is present in the Hfr strain.\n\nNow let's examine each of the answer choices:\n\n(A) A vector of yeast or bacterial origin which is used to make many copies of a particular DNA sequence: This answer choice is incorrect because an Hfr strain of E. coli does not contain a vector. Vectors are used in genetic engineering to introduce foreign DNA into bacteria, but they are not a natural part of an Hfr strain.\n\n(B) A bacterial chromosome with a human gene inserted: This answer choice is also incorrect because an Hfr strain of E. coli does not contain a human gene inserted into its bacterial chromosome. The genetic material transferred by an Hfr strain is typically bacterial DNA, not human DNA.\n\n(C) A bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted: This answer choice is correct. An Hfr strain of E. coli contains a bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted. The F factor is a small circular DNA molecule that enables the transfer of genetic material from the Hfr strain to other bacteria through conjugation.\n\n(D) A human chromosome with a transposable element inserted: This answer choice is incorrect because an Hfr strain of E. coli does not contain a human chromosome.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what the inbreeding coefficient (F) represents. The inbreeding coefficient is a measure of the probability that two alleles at a given locus are identical by descent. In other words, it measures the degree of inbreeding in a population.\n\nNow, let's examine each of the answer choices and determine which one is most likely to be affected by an increase in the inbreeding coefficient:\n\n(A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population: As the inbreeding coefficient increases, the probability of two identical alleles being inherited from both parents also increases. This means that there is a reduced likelihood of heterozygotes (individuals with two different alleles at a given locus) being present in the population.\n\n(B) higher proportion of genes that show linkage: Linkage refers to the tendency of alleles at different loci to be inherited together. While inbreeding can increase the frequency of certain alleles in a population, it does not directly affect the proportion of genes that show linkage.\n\n(C) higher proportion of genes with introns: Introns are non-coding sequences within a gene that are spliced out during the process of transcription. The presence or absence of introns is not directly related to the inbreeding coefficient.\n\n(D) higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells: This answer choice is not directly related to the inbreeding coefficient, as the level of difference between RNA molecules in daughter cells is determined by the process of transcription and RNA processing, not by inbreeding.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely outcome of an increase in the inbreeding coefficient is:\n\n(A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what \u03b1-thalassaemia is and then identify the common mutation involved in it.\n\n\u03b1-thalassaemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, which is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The \u03b1-globin genes are located on chromosome 16 and are responsible for producing the \u03b1-globin protein, one of the two subunits that make up hemoglobin.\n\nThe common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia is a deletion of one or more of the \u03b1-globin genes. This deletion results in a reduced production of \u03b1-globin protein, leading to an imbalance in the ratio of \u03b1-globin to \u03b2-globin, the other subunit of hemoglobin. This imbalance causes the red blood cells to be smaller and paler than normal, leading to the symptoms of \u03b1-thalassaemia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) a deletion.",
