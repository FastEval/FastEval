            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's examine each statement and evaluate its accuracy:\n\n(A) Mean squared error is usually highly correlated with trading rule profitability:\nMean squared error (MSE) is a measure of the average squared difference between forecasted values and actual values. While MSE is a commonly used metric for evaluating forecast accuracy, it is not necessarily highly correlated with trading rule profitability, as other factors such as transaction costs and market volatility can impact profitability.\n\n(B) Mean absolute error provides a quadratic loss function:\nMean absolute error (MAE) is a measure of the average absolute difference between forecasted values and actual values. Unlike MSE, MAE uses the absolute value of the difference, which means it provides a linear, rather than quadratic, loss function.\n\n(C) Mean absolute percentage error is a useful measure for evaluating asset return forecasts:\nMean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is a measure of the average absolute percentage difference between forecasted values and actual values. MAPE is particularly useful for evaluating asset return forecasts because it takes into account the percentage error, which is more relevant when dealing with percentage changes in asset prices.\n\n(D) Mean squared error penalises large forecast errors disproportionately more than small forecast errors:\nAs mentioned earlier, MSE is a measure of the average squared difference between forecasted values and actual values. Because it uses the square of the difference, MSE does penalize large forecast errors disproportionately more than small forecast errors.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n(D) Mean squared error penalises large forecast errors disproportionately more than small forecast errors",
