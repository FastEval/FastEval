The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible.

            "model_answer": "To determine which statistical measure the teachers' union would be most likely to quote during negotiations, we need to consider the goals of the union and the implications of each measure.\n\n(A) The mean of all the salaries: The mean is calculated by adding up all the salaries and dividing by the number of employees. It gives an overall average of the salaries, but it can be heavily influenced by a few high salaries, such as those of administrators.\n\n(B) The mode of all the salaries: The mode is the salary that occurs most frequently. In this case, it would likely be the salary of the moderately paid teachers. However, the mode does not take into account the salaries of all employees or provide an overall average.\n\n(C) The standard deviation of all the salaries: The standard deviation measures the dispersion of the salaries, showing how much they vary from the mean. It does not give an overall average of the salaries and would not be directly relevant to the union's goal of increasing pay.\n\n(D) The median of all the salaries: The median is the salary that falls at the 50th percentile, meaning that half of the employees earn less and half earn more. It provides a middle value that is less influenced by outliers, such as high administrator salaries.\n\nGiven the goals of the teachers' union, they would likely want to quote a measure that shows the average salary of the majority of employees, who are moderately paid teachers. Therefore, the teachers' union would be most likely to quote:\n\n(D) The median of all the salaries.",

The term \"np\" is not defined in the question, so we cannot assume it has any specific value.

The values of X can be any real numbers, and their probabilities can be any non-negative numbers that add up to one.\n\n(C) The probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one.\n- This statement is true.
