A spontaneous reaction is one that occurs without the input of energy and proceeds in the direction that forms products.\n\n(A) At equilibrium, the concentrations of reactants and products are equal, so there cannot be more products than reactants at equilibrium. This option is incorrect.\n\n(B) The value of \u0394G\u00b0 (the standard Gibbs free energy change) is a measure of the spontaneity of a reaction. A negative value of \u0394G\u00b0 indicates that the reaction is spontaneous in the forward direction, while a positive value indicates that the reaction is nonspontaneous.

It is inversely proportional to the reaction rate. In other words, if the reaction rate decreases, the half-life increases, and vice versa.\n\nNow let's examine each of the given options:\n\n(A) Increasing the initial concentration of SO2Cl2:\nFor a first-order reaction, the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant. Therefore, increasing the initial concentration of SO2Cl2 will increase the reaction rate, which will result in a decrease in the half-life.\n\n(B) Increasing the temperature at which the reaction occurs:\nIncreasing the temperature generally increases the reaction rate for most chemical reactions, including first-order reactions. This is because higher temperatures provide more kinetic energy to the reactant molecules, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions between them. As a result, the reaction rate increases, and the half-life decreases.\n\n(C) Decreasing the overall pressure in the container:\nFor a reaction that involves gaseous reactants and products, decreasing the overall pressure in the container will decrease the concentration of the reactant gas.
