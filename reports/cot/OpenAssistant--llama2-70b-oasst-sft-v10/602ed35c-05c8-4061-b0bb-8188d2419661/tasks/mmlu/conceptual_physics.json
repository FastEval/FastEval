            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's examine each of the options and determine which ones are predictions of general relativity.\n\n(A) Light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity.\nGeneral relativity predicts that gravity can bend light, and this effect has been observed through experiments such as the gravitational lensing effect. However, general relativity does not predict that light is slowed down by gravity. The speed of light is considered to be constant in a vacuum, regardless of the presence of gravity.\n\n(B) Light passing the Sun is deflected.\nThis is a well-known prediction of general relativity. According to the theory, massive objects cause a curvature of spacetime, which can cause light to be deflected as it passes by the object. This effect was first observed during the 1919 solar eclipse and is known as the Eddington effect.\n\n(C) A clock on the Sun's surface runs faster than on Earth.\nGeneral relativity predicts that time dilation occurs in the presence of strong gravitational fields. This means that clocks at different distances from a massive object will tick at different rates, with clocks closer to the object ticking slower than clocks farther away. Therefore, a clock on the Sun's surface would actually run slower than a clock on Earth, not faster.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) light passing the Sun is deflected.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what happens when an element ejects a beta particle.\n\nBeta decay is a type of radioactive decay in which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting a beta particle. There are two types of beta particles: beta-minus and beta-plus.\n\nA beta-minus particle is a negatively charged electron that is emitted from the nucleus of an atom. When a nucleus emits a beta-minus particle, it loses one proton and one electron, which results in a decrease in the atomic number by 1.\n\nA beta-plus particle is a positively charged proton that is emitted from the nucleus of an atom. When a nucleus emits a beta-plus particle, it gains one proton and one electron, which results in an increase in the atomic number by 1.\n\nNow, let's look at the options given:\n\n(A) reduces by 1\n(B) increases by 1\n(C) reduces by 2\n(D) increases by 2\n\nSince beta decay involves the emission of either a beta-minus particle or a beta-plus particle, the atomic number will either decrease by 1 or increase by 1. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) reduces by 1 or (B) increases by 1",

This EMF causes a flow of electric charge, which is known as an electric current.\n\n(B) Voltage: The EMF induced in the loop due to the changing magnetic field is essentially a voltage. This voltage drives the electric current through the wire.\n\n(C) Electric field: An electric field exists in the vicinity of electric charges, and it is responsible for the force that causes charged particles to move.

This is because the object is constantly being pulled towards the Earth by gravity. The centripetal force required to keep the object moving in a circular path is provided by the gravitational force between the Earth and the object.\n\nNow let's evaluate each of the answer choices:\n\n(A) zero - This is incorrect because the gravitational force on an object in orbit is never zero.

The gravitational force is always present and acts towards the center of the Earth.\n\n(C) appreciably weaker than at Earth\u2019s surface - This is correct. The gravitational force on an object in orbit is weaker than at the Earth's surface because the object is farther away from the center of the Earth. The force is weaker, but it is still present and acts towards the center of the Earth.\n\n(D) without a component of force along their circular path - This is incorrect because the gravitational force always has a component along the circular path.
