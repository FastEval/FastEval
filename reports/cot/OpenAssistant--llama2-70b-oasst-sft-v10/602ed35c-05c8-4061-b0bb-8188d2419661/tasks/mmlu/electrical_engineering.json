            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what induction heating is and how it works.\n\nInduction heating is a process in which an electrical current is generated within a conductive material by using a changing magnetic field. This generated electrical current then produces heat within the material.\n\nNow let's evaluate each of the given options:\n\n(A) conducting but non-magnetic materials: Induction heating relies on the changing magnetic field to generate the electrical current within the material. If the material is non-magnetic, it will not be affected by the magnetic field, and therefore, induction heating will not occur.\n\n(B) conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magnetic materials: This option is partially correct. Induction heating can take place in conducting materials, whether they are magnetic or non-magnetic. However, the option does not specify that the material must be conductive, which is a crucial requirement for induction heating.\n\n(C) insulating materials: Insulating materials do not conduct electricity, so induction heating cannot take place in these materials.\n\n(D) conducting and magnetic materials: This option is correct. For induction heating to occur, the material must be conductive so that an electrical current can be generated within it. Additionally, the material must be magnetic so that it is affected by the changing magnetic field and generates the electrical current that produces heat.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) conducting and magnetic materials.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand the key concepts involved:\n\n1. Direct core type induction furnaces: These are furnaces in which the metal to be heated is placed directly inside the coil of the induction furnace.\n\n2. Low frequency supply: This refers to an electrical supply with a lower frequency than normal, typically in the range of 50-60 Hz.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given options:\n\n(A) With normal frequency supply, the electromagnetic forces cause severe stirring action in the molten metal: This is true. When a direct core type induction furnace is supplied with normal frequency power, the high-frequency electromagnetic field induces strong eddy currents in the molten metal. These eddy currents generate heat and cause the molten metal to circulate vigorously, which can be undesirable in some applications.\n\n(B) Magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuit is poor: This is not entirely true. In a direct core type induction furnace, the primary circuit is the coil that generates the electromagnetic field, and the secondary circuit is the metal to be heated. The magnetic coupling between these two circuits is actually quite good, as the metal to be heated is placed directly inside the coil.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) With normal frequency supply, the electromagnetic forces cause severe stirring action in the molten metal.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand the concept of critical frequency and its relation to the pole of a network.\n\nIn electrical circuits, the critical frequency is the frequency at which the phase angle between the input voltage and current is 90 degrees. This means that the reactive power is maximum at this frequency.\n\nThe pole of a network refers to the point at which the impedance of the network becomes infinite. In other words, it is the frequency at which the network becomes purely reactive.\n\nNow, let's consider the given options:\n\n(A) LC: This type of network consists of an inductor (L) and a capacitor (C) connected in series or parallel. The pole of an LC network is given by the formula:\n\ns = 1/(LC^(-1))\n\nwhere s is the complex frequency variable.\n\n(B) RL: This type of network consists of a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) connected in series. The pole of an RL network is given by the formula:\n\ns = R/L\n\n(C) RC: This type of network consists of a resistor (R) and a capacitor (C) connected in series. The pole of an RC network is given by the formula:\n\ns = 1/(RC^(-1))\n\nFrom the above formulas, we can see that the pole of an LC network can be present at the origin or nearer to the origin when the value of L or C is very large. This means that the critical frequency of an LC network can be very low.\n\nTherefore, the type of network with the lowest critical frequency due to the pole being present at the origin or nearer to the origin is:\n\n(A) LC.",

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total charge on the metal surface and then calculate the electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total charge on the metal surface.\nThe metal surface has a radius of 1 meter and a surface charge density of 20 coulombs/m\u00b2. To find the total charge, we need to integrate the surface charge density over the surface area of the sphere.\n\nTotal charge (Q) = \u222b\u03c3dA\n\nWhere \u03c3 is the surface charge density (20 C/m\u00b2) and dA is the differential area element.\n\nSince the metal surface is a sphere, we can use the formula for the surface area of a sphere:\n\nA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2\n\nWhere r is the radius (1 m).\n\nSubstituting r = 1 m and \u03c3 = 20 C/m\u00b2 into the formula for total charge, we get:\n\nQ = \u222b(20 C/m\u00b2)(4\u03c0(1 m)\u00b2)dA\nQ = 20 C * 4\u03c0 * (1 m)\u00b2\nQ = 80\u03c0 C\n\nSo the total charge on the metal surface is 80\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube.\nThe metal surface is enclosed in a cube with side length 10 m. To find the electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube, we need to calculate the electric field strength at the surface of the cube and then multiply it by the permittivity of free space (\u03b5\u2080) and the area of the cube's side.\n\nElectric field strength (E) = Q/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080r\u00b2)\n\nWhere Q is the total charge on the metal surface (80\u03c0 C) and r is the distance between the metal surface and the cube's side (10 m).\n\nSubstituting Q = 80\u03c0 C and r = 10 m into the formula for electric field strength, we get:\n\nE = (80\u03c0 C)/(4\u03c0(8.854187817620...e-12 F/m) * (10 m)\u00b2)\nE = (80\u03c0 C)/(3.2831852941176...e-10 F\u00b7m\u00b2/C)\nE = 2.4414516227048...e-08 V/m\n\nSo the electric field strength at the surface of the cube is 2.4414516227048...e-08 V/m.\n\nNow we can calculate the electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube:\n\nD = \u03b5\u2080 * E\n\nWhere \u03b5\u2080 is the permittivity of free space (8.854187817620...e-12 F/m).\n\nSubstituting E = 2.4414516227048...e-08 V/m and \u03b5\u2080 = 8.854187817620...e-12 F/m into the formula for electric displacement, we get:\n\nD = (8.854187817620...e-12 F/m) * (2.4414516227048...e-08 V/m)\nD = 2.1543233933776...e-03 C/m\u00b2\n\nSo the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube is 2.1543233933776...e-03 coulombs/m\u00b2.\n\nHowever, none of the given options match this answer.
