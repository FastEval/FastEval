            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what next-generation sequencing (NGS) is and its applications.\n\nNGS is a high-throughput sequencing technology that allows researchers to sequence large amounts of DNA or RNA quickly and cost-effectively. It has revolutionized genomics research and has many applications in various fields, including medical research, agriculture, and environmental sciences.\n\nNow let's evaluate each of the given options:\n\n(A) To identify a newly discovered virus: NGS can be used to identify newly discovered viruses by sequencing the viral genome. This can help researchers understand the virus's origin, evolution, and potential threats.\n\n(B) To search for drug-resistant mutants: NGS can be used to detect drug-resistant mutations in pathogens, such as bacteria or viruses. This information can help develop more effective treatments and prevent the spread of drug-resistant strains.\n\n(C) To identify quasi-species viruses: Quasi-species refer to a population of closely related virus variants that exist within a single host. NGS can be used to identify these variants and understand their evolution and impact on disease severity.\n\n(D) Cannot be used: This option is incorrect, as NGS has many applications in various fields, as mentioned earlier.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the most common use of NGS among the given options is:\n\n(B) To search for drug-resistant mutants",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through each option and evaluate how randomization helps in controlling them:\n\n(A) Placebo effect: Randomization helps in controlling the placebo effect by ensuring that the study subjects are assigned to treatment and control groups randomly. This reduces the chances of any systematic differences between the groups that could influence the results.\n\n(B) Recall bias: Recall bias occurs when study subjects have different levels of recall about their exposure or outcome status. Randomization does not directly control for recall bias, as it does not affect the accuracy of the subjects' recall.\n\n(C) Non-compliance: Non-compliance occurs when study subjects do not follow the assigned treatment protocol. Randomization does not directly control for non-compliance, as it does not ensure that subjects will adhere to their assigned treatment.\n\n(D) Effect modification (interaction): Effect modification occurs when the effect of an exposure on an outcome varies depending on other factors. Randomization helps in controlling for effect modification by ensuring that the treatment and control groups are balanced with respect to potential confounding factors.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Placebo effect",

It was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and has primarily been reported in the Arabian Peninsula. While MERS can cause severe illness and death, it has not caused thousands of deaths worldwide and is not considered an 'emergent' virus on a global scale.\n\n(B) SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome): SARS is a viral respiratory illness caused by the SARS coronavirus. It was first identified in 2002 in Guangdong Province, China, and spread to other countries in Asia and later worldwide. The 2002-2003 SARS outbreak caused over 8,000 cases and nearly 800 deaths globally. However, since then, there have been no known cases of SARS transmission.\n\n(C) OC43: OC43 is a common human coronavirus that typically causes mild respiratory infections, such as the common cold. It is not considered an 'emergent' virus and does not cause thousands of deaths worldwide.\n\n(D) HKU1: HKU1 is another common human coronavirus that typically causes mild respiratory infections, similar to OC43. It is not considered an 'emergent' virus and does not cause thousands of deaths worldwide.\n\nBased on the information above, the answer is:\n\n(B) SARS",

These proteins can disrupt normal cellular regulation and contribute to cancer development.\n\n(B) Integrates viral genome into cellular DNA: HPV integrates its genome into the host cell's DNA, which can lead to the expression of the viral oncogenes E6 and E7. This integration can cause genetic mutations and contribute to cancer development.\n\n(C) Has an oncogene able to initiate cancer: The E6 and E7 proteins encoded by HPV are considered oncogenes, as they can disrupt normal cellular regulation and promote cancer development.\n\n(D) Acts as a co-factor for a cellular oncogene: While HPV's oncogenic proteins can act as co-factors for cellular oncogenes, this is not the primary mechanism by which the papilloma family of viruses causes cancer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n(A) Replicate in dividing cells and encodes three oncogenic proteins E5, E6 and E7",

Adaptive immune cells have the ability to recognize and respond to specific antigens that are not present on the body's own cells, thus distinguishing between self and non-self.\n\n(C) Ability to distinguish viruses and bacteria: Adaptive immunity can recognize and respond to both viruses and bacteria, but this is not a unique feature of adaptive immunity as innate immunity also has the ability to recognize and respond to pathogens.\n\n(D) Short memory: This is not a feature of adaptive immunity.

This is a common mode of transmission for respiratory viruses, so this option is not an exception.\n\n(C) Reservoir in bats: Bats are known to be a reservoir for many viruses, including coronaviruses like MERS.
