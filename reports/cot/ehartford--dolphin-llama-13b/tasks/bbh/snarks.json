The tone indicates a mix of surprise and skepticism, which might be an indication of sarcasm.\n\n(B) You mean Knuth up arrow notation isn't normal for you?\n- This statement implies that Knuth up arrow notation should be commonplace for the person being addressed, and questions whether that's the case. It has a tone of surprise, but it seems less sarcastic compared to option A.\n\nBased on the analysis, I conclude that the sarcastic statement is:\n\n(A) You mean Knuth up arrow notation isn't unfamiliar for you?",

However, the difference between the two is the acknowledgment of whether it's the first or last week of winter. Since it's generally not common to acknowledge that the last week of winter will get warmer, we can infer that:\n\nOption A is the sarcastic statement.",

Therefore, this statement is not sarcastic.\n\nStatement B: Sneaking out of a government facility with dangerous contraband isn't going to be legal.\nThis statement suggests that escaping with dangerous contraband from a government facility is not a legal action, which is a serious point. However, it might have a sarcastic tone because it's pointing out the obviousness of the fact that breaking the law isn't legal. As a result, this statement can be considered sarcastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n(B) Sneaking out of a government facility with dangerous contraband isn't going to be legal",
