Thomas saw David sitting on a rooftop from 12pm to 2pm. The gas station would be closed, so this option is invalid.\n2. Tiffany saw David getting a coffee at the cafe from 2pm to 3pm. The gas station would be closed, so this option is invalid.\n3. James saw David fixing their computer at the electronic store from 3pm to 5pm. The gas station would be closed, so this option is invalid.\n4. Mark saw David reading at the library from 5pm to 6pm. The gas station would be closed, so this option is invalid.\n\nNow we are left with only option:\n5. Michael saw David waiting at the train station from 7am to 12pm. The gas station might be open during this time as it is before the 8pm closure.\n\nTherefore, David may have gone to the gas station between 7am and 12pm.\n\nThe answer is: (D) 7am to 12pm.",
