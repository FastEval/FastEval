Calculate the number of years that have passed:\n   Today's date is 2022, so the time difference is 2022 - 1992 = 30 years.\n\n2. Convert the time difference to months:\n   There are 12 months in a year, so 30 years * 12 months/year = 360 months.\n\n3. Calculate the number of days remaining in the month:\n   Assuming the current date in 2022 is before May 6, there are 31 days in May. Since it's before May 6, there are still 31 - 6 = 25 days remaining in the month.\n\n4. Convert the days remaining to years:\n   Based on the number of days remaining in the month (25 days) and the months passed (360 months), it will take 12 months to complete a year for a total of 360 / 12 = 30 years left to complete 360 months.\n\n5. Ensure time travel is not possible by verifying the time difference does not exceed one-month time difference:\n   Since the years passed (30 years) is equal to the number of months remaining in the year (30 months), the time difference does not exceed one-month time difference.\n\n6. Calculate the day of the month:\n   The current date must be on or before May 6 and would have 25 days passed.\n\nThe answer is (F) 05/06/1964.\nExplanation: Based on the calculations, it has been 30 years since May 6, 1992, which makes today May 6, 2022. However, since the time travel condition is not met, we go back to May 6, 1964, which still satisfies the time travel condition and is the correct answer.",

Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month.\n2. The last visit was the 5th visit today, which means the next visit (6th visit) is on the 16th of the month.\n\nCalculate the month and year of the 6th visit:\n\n- October 2009 (1st visit)\n- November 2009 (2nd visit)\n- December 2009 (3rd visit)\n- January 2010 (4th visit)\n- February 2010 (5th visit, which happened today)\n- March 2010 (6th visit on the 16th)\n\nNow find the date for the 6th visit in MM/DD/YYYY format:\n\n- The 16th of a month falls between the 10th and the 19th, so the day of the 6th visit (today) will be 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20.\n- Among the answer options, only (D) and (E) have the 16th as the final day of the month. \n\nNow, let's analyze the year for each option:\n\n(A) 02/06/2010 - Year is 2010, doesn't match the timeline.\n(B) 12/21/2009 - Year is 2009, doesn't match the num of visits.\n(C) 02/16/1933 - Year is 1933, doesn't match the number of visits.\n(D) 02/16/2010 - Year is 2010, the 16th falls on the 20th day of the month (16 * 1 = 16, 20 - 16 = 4).\n(E) 11/30/2009 - Year is 2009, the 16th falls on the 30th day of the month (16 * 1 = 16, 30 - 16 = 14).\n\nHowever, if we analyze the visits, we see that:\n\n1. First visit: 10/16/2009\n2. Second visit: 11/16/2009\n3. Third visit: 12/16/2009\n4. Fourth visit: 01/16/2010\n5. Fifth visit: 02/16/2010\n\nAccording to this timeline, the 16th falls on the 20th day of the month, which matches with option (D).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) 02/16/2010",
            "correct": true
