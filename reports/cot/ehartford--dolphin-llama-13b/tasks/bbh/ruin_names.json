The change in 'war' creates a humorous substitution ('warts' looks like 'warts', which is a funny change) but it degrades the original art or movie name.\n\n(D) star warws\nReasoning: This option replaces the second letter from 'star' with 'star' and the space between the two 'war's with just one 'w'.
