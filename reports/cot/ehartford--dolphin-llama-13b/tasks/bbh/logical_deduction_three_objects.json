Each vehicle is described with respect to the other two. \n\nWording specifically states:\n\"The motorcyle is newer than the convertible.\"\n\"The convertible is newer than the truck.\"\n\nStep 2: Assess the relationships between the vehicles. Given that M is motorcyle, C is a convertible, and T is a truck, and assessing the phrase \"The motorcyle is newer than the convertible\", M > C.

The truck, which was mentioned to be newer than the convertible, is also not the oldest vehicle among the three.\n\nThus, having no viable alternatives, the only option that aligns with our collected information is:\n(A) The convertible is the oldest.\n\nTherefore, our answer is (A).",
