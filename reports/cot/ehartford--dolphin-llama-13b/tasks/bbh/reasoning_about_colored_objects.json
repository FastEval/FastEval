There are 2 black scrunchiephone chargers.\n\nStep 2: Subtract the number of black items from the initial total number of black items to find the remaining total number of black items. Since there are only 2 black items initially, no subtraction is needed. So the number remains 2.\n\nStep 3: Subtract the number of black scrunchiephone chargers from the initial total number of scrunchiephone chargers to find the remaining total number of scrunchiephone chargers. Initially, there are 3 pink and 2 black scrunchiephone chargers, making it a total of 5 chargers. So the number of remaining chargers becomes 5-2=3.\n\nThe answer is (C) three.",
