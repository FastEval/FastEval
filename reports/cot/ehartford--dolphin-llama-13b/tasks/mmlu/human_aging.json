This seems like a reasonable option.\n\n(B) Geropsychiatry: This specialized branch of psychiatry focuses on mental health issues in older adults, but it doesn't cover the broader aspect of aging.\n\n(C) Geriatrics: Geriatrics is a branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases and disorders in older adults. It covers physical aspects of aging.\n\n(D) Gero-education: This term is not commonly used to describe the study of aging, but rather refers to education and training in the field of gerontology.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Gerontology",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, I will analyze each factor associated with Alzheimer's risk:\n\n(A) Being an African or Hispanic American: Although these ethnicities have lower rates of Alzheimer's compared to non-Hispanic whites, they are still at risk for the disease due to the increased prevalence of lifestyle and environmental factors.\n\n(B) Eating fish: Numerous studies have indicated that regular fish consumption could reduce the risk of Alzheimer's and other cognitive declines. Fish are rich sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which exhibit neuroprotective effects and might help reduce inflammation in the brain.\n\n(C) A lower level of education: Some research suggests that a lower level of education may be associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's, possibly due to differences in lifestyle, socioeconomic status, or other factors.\n\n(D) Being married: Some studies indicate that married individuals might have a reduced risk of Alzheimer's compared to unmarried individuals. However, the significance of this association is still not well understood.\n\nAfter analyzing the factors, the most strongly associated factor with decreased risk of Alzheimer's is:\n\n(B) Eating fish",

This statement does not directly relate to docility; it focuses on vulnerability to environmental demands.\n\n(B) Those who experience high environmental demands become more docile. This statement contradicts the docility hypothesis, as it suggests that high environmental demands lead to increased docility, instead of decreased docility as the hypothesis proposes.\n\n(C) Those who experience high environmental demands become less docile. This statement aligns with the docility hypothesis, as it suggests that high environmental demands lead to decreased docility, which is the intended outcome according to the hypothesis.\n\n(D) Those with less capability are less vulnerable to environmental demands.

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the question - In this case, the question asks which option normal memory seems to be improved by.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate each option\n\n(A) Aerobic exercise - Studies have shown that aerobic exercise can improve memory performance by increasing blood flow to the brain and promoting the growth of new neurons (source: research).\n\n(B) Taking acetylcholine - Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter involved in memory and cognitive functions. Enhancing its levels might improve memory. However, it is not recommended to use acetylcholine supplements, as they can have side effects (source: medical advice).\n\n(C) Taking gingko - Ginkgo biloba is a popular herbal supplement believed to have cognitive-enhancing effects due to its antioxidant properties. Some studies have found positive results, while others have been inconclusive (source: research).\n\n(D) Increasing social contacts - Social interactions stimulate the brain and can improve cognitive functions such as memory (source: research).\n\nStep 3: Choose the best option and justify the answer\n\nBased on the evaluation of each option, the best option for improving normal memory seems to be:\n\n(A) Aerobic exercise\n\nThis is because it has been more consistently proven to be effective in improving memory performance, while the effects of other options like gingko and increasing social contacts can be less consistent and might have possible side effects.",

Mechanistic emphasizes the study of behavior in terms of cause and effect, while organismic focuses on the understanding of behavior in terms of how it relates to the individual as a whole. Both these perspectives hold importance in psychology.\n\n(C) Continuity vs. discontinuity: Continuity refers to the idea that behavior is continuous and smoothly transitions from one state to another, whereas discontinuity suggests that there might be abrupt changes in behavior.
