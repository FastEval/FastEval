To decide which option best fits this representation, we analyze each option:\n\n(A) Tdc\n- In this option, \"T\" seems to represent \"teaches,\" \"d\" could be \"David,\" and \"c\" could be \"Chris.\" However, since there is a typo with \"d\" instead of \"D,\" we will disregard this option.\n\n(B) Tcd\n- In this option, \"T\" represents \"teaches,\" \"c\" could be \"Chris,\" and \"d\" represents \"David.\" Since this option correctly places the teacher (David) and the student (Chris), we will consider this option further.\n\n(C) Tcc\n- In this option, \"T\" represents \"teaches,\" \"c\" could be \"Chris,\" and \"c\" represents \"Chris\" again. However, having \"cc\" could lead to confusion as Chris is both teacher and student, so we disregard this option.\n\n(D) dTc\n- In this option, \"d\" is \"David,\" \"T\" represents \"teaches,\" and \"c\" represents \"Chris.\" While it correctly identifies the teacher (David) and the student (Chris), the syntax is inverted, so we disregard this option as well.\n\nThus, after analyzing all the options, the best translation of \"David teaches Chris\" into predicate logic is:\n\n(B) Tcd",

(Bxy) x is bigger than y (\u2203x)[(Ax \u2022 Lx) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Hy \u2022 Bxy)].\nFrom this, we can say that there are some houses that are bigger than some apartments, which makes statement (A) correct.\n\n(B) Some houses are bigger than all large apartments.\nThis statement implies that all large apartments could be smaller than some houses, which is not true in all scenarios. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n(C) Some large apartments are bigger than some houses.\nThis statement is not reflected in the given proposition but stating the opposite of statement (A), which makes this statement incorrect.\n\n(D) Some houses are bigger than some large apartments.\nThis statement could be rewritten as (B) some houses are bigger than all large apartments, which is incorrect. However, it corresponds to statement (A) when switching the positions of houses and apartments. In that case, we need to check our reasoning.\n\n(A) To be larger, a house initially needs to exist, and then for a house to be larger, there must exist an apartment that is larger than the house. Thus, the existence of larger apartments is necessary for the possibility of houses being larger. \n\nFor this to occur, we need the following expressions to be valid:\n1. (Ax) There are some x's that are apartments.\n2. (Lx) x's that are big apartments.\n3. (Hy) There are some y's that are houses.\n4. (Bxy) x is bigger than y (\u2203x)[(Ax \u2022 Lx) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Hy \u2022 Bxy)].\n\nAs we can see, if these expressions are valid, our reasoning aligns with that of statement (D).
