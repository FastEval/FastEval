            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each principle step-by-step to determine which one is not an element of the responsibility to protect.\n\n(A) The responsibility to prevent: Preventing harm and violence, especially towards vulnerable populations, is a key aspect of the responsibility to protect.\n\n(B) The responsibility to react: Reacting to threats and conflicts as they emerge is vital for maintaining a safe and secure environment, which aligns with the principle of the responsibility to protect.\n\n(C) The responsibility to remain sovereign: Sovereignty refers to a state's ability to govern itself without external interference. While remaining sovereign is important for maintaining security and sovereignty, it does not directly address the broader responsibility to protect its citizens from harm.\n\n(D) The responsibility to rebuild: Rebuilding after a conflict or disaster can be essential to ensure the well-being and safety of communities. Although this principle contributes to the overall responsibility to protect, it focuses solely on the aftermath rather than the prevention and response aspects.\n\nFrom the step-by-step analysis, it appears that:\n(C) The responsibility to remain sovereign is not an element of the responsibility to protect.",

So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

This criticism suggests that the concept of human security may perpetuate historical inequalities.\n\n(B) Human security promotes global capitalism.\nglobal capitalism refers to the dominance of international trade and investment in the global economy.

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated.\n(D) Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated.

However, it does not directly address the policy interaction problem between academe and policy.\n\n(C) This option highlights how security studies became an increasing part of International Relations' discipline, strengthening IR's role in the academia-policy interaction. Though IR's involvement impacts policy, this option does not entirely explain the problem arising in the institutionalization.\n\n(D) This option discusses the interrelations between think tanks, policymakers, and institutions, creating policy mergers at multiple levels.
