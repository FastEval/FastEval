There are two forces acting on the box: gravity (force downwards, F_g) and the force from the surface (upwards, F_s). The box feels only these two forces.\n\n3. Kinetic friction is a force that opposes the motion of the box. The force of kinetic friction (F_k) can be represented by the coefficient of kinetic friction (\u03bc), which is multiplied by the box's speed (v). Mathematically, F_k = \u03bc * v.\n\n4. To find how far the box slides before coming to rest, we need to study the net force acting on the box.\n\n5. Initially, the net force acting on the box is the sum of the force from friction (upwards, F_s = \u03bc * v) and gravity (downwards, F_g). Thus, F_net = F_s + F_g = \u03bcv + g.\n\n6. Equilibrium (the box comes to rest) is reached when F_net = 0, which means that the net force must exactly balance the force due to friction and gravity.\n\n7.

The value of v will be greater than g since the box slides before stopping. Thrust gained by the box due to its horizontal motion is also greater than g.

            "model_answer": "To answer the question, we'll need to find the time it takes for the soccer ball to travel a certain distance given its initial velocity and launch angle, which we are assuming to be negligible air resistance.\n\nStep 1: Convert the initial velocity to the same unit as the distance. In this case, it will be meters per second (m/s). We are given that the initial velocity is 10 m/s.\n\nStep 2: Find an equation that relates initial velocity, launch angle, and time (distance). For a projectile following a horizontal path, the equation is distance = initial velocity \u00d7 time.\n\nStep 3: Simplify and solve for time (distance) using the launch angle. The launch angle is 30\u00b0, so sin(30\u00b0) must be used in the equation. This is because the horizontal distance the ball travels is the initial velocity multiplied by the time, while the actual distance it covers (taking into account the height it reaches due to the launch angle) is the initial velocity multiplied by cos(30\u00b0) times the time. So, the relationship becomes distance = initial velocity \u00d7 (time) for horizontal path, and distance = initial velocity \u00d7 (cos(30\u00b0) \u00d7 time) for the actual path.\n\nStep 4: Plug in the known values and solve for time. Distance = initial velocity \u00d7 (cos(30\u00b0) \u00d7 time) = 10 m/s \u00d7 (cos(30\u00b0) \u00d7 time). We can plug-in the value of cos(30\u00b0) which is approximately 0.567179 atan(10/10), simplifying it further: distance = initial velocity \u00d7 (0.567 \u00d7 time).\n\nStep 5: Rearrange the equation to find time: time = distance / initial velocity. Substitute the distance from step 4: time = (10 m/s) / (10 m/s) = 1 s.\n\nSo, the soccer ball takes 1 second to cover a distance equal to its initial velocity after accounting for the launch angle.\n\nAnswer: (B) 1 s",
