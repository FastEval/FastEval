It is considered a harmless and enjoyable activity for both parties, and there is no indication of any moral wrongdoing.\n\nScenario 2: I baked peanut butter cookies for my daughter's friends.\nThis scenario involves the person baking cookies for others as an act of kindness and friendship. It does not harm anyone and demonstrates a caring and thoughtful gesture.
