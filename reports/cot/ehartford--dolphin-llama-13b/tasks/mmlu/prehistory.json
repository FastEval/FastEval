            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "This question appears to be an exam question asking about the characteristics of Minoan culture compared to other early civilizations. I will break down each option to deduce which one fits best in the context of the question:\n\n(A) Trade\nThe Minoan civilization was known for its thriving trade, especially with other ancient civilizations such as Egypt and the Near East. Therefore, this option does not seem accurate.\n\n(B) Warfare\nThere's evidence to suggest that the Minoan civilization was involved in various conflicts, especially with other island cultures and the mainland Greeks. However, it wasn't characterized by large-scale wars or warfare like some other early civilizations. Therefore, this option could have some truth to it.\n\n(C) The development of a common religion\nThe Minoan civilization had a complex and multifaceted religious system, which wasn't centered on a single deity nor shared by all members of the civilization. This option could also be accurate.\n\n(D) Conspicuous consumption by elites\nThe Minoan culture does show evidence of wealth in elite art, architecture, and burial sites, indicating some degree of conspicuous consumption. However, Minoan society displayed conspicuous consumption to a lesser extent compared to some of their contemporary civilizations. \n\nGiven the information above, option (B) warfare best fits the criteria of something that Minoan culture shows little evidence of, compared to other early civilizations. \n\nSo, the answer is (B) warfare.",

So, this is not the correct option.\n\n(B) Homo erectus, the evolutionary descendants of the premodern human inhabitants of Europe and Asia\n- Homo erectus lived in Africa, Asia, and Europe, but appeared much earlier than when anatomically modern humans arrived. Their time span ranges from 1.9 million years ago to 30,000 years ago. Anatomically modern humans, who are Homo sapiens, appeared only around 300,000 years ago. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n(C) Homo sapiens, who had evolved independently in Asia and arrived there by 200,000 years ago\n- Homo sapiens could not have been in the Middle East when anatomically modern humans first arrived since they only appeared around 300,000 years ago. Thus, this option is also incorrect.\n\nAs we have gone through each of the options, none of them demonstrate the correct scenario of what happened when anatomically modern humans first arrived in the Middle East.

As the \"Lion Man\" is a figure found in a cave, it is reasonable to assume that it may be parietal art.\n\n(D) a Venus figurine: The \"Lion Man\" is half-human and half-lion, which makes it different from Venus figurines, which are typically depictions of a human female form.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the \"Lion Man\" from Hohlenstein-Stadel cave is an example of:\n\n(C) parietal art.",

So it can be concluded that there is some form of formal government in Hopewell despite being a society and not a state. Therefore, we can rule out (A).\n\n(B) Monumental earthworks are found in Hopewell culture, for instance, the Newark Earthworks in Ohio, which is one of the best examples of Hopewell culture. So, this option can be ruled out as well.\n\n(C) Hopewell society was not an urban culture, but rather rural. Domestic life was focused on farming. So, urban centers could not be part of Hopewell culture, making this option a possibility.\n\n(D) There is no mention of a permanent military in the description of Hopewell society.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, let us break down the question step-by-step and understand the terminology involved.\n\nStep 1: Understand the structure of Stonehenge.\nStonehenge is a prehistoric monument known for its circular arrangement of stone blocks. It is believed to have been constructed in several stages over more than a thousand years.\n\nStep 2: Identify the upright and horizontal stones.\nUpright stones are the vertical stones which form the main ring of Stonehenge. There are 30 of them, and they are placed vertically in the ground with their narrower ends pointing inwards.\n\nHorizontal stones, on the other hand, are the larger stones that lie horizontally across the upright stones, creating a rectangular frame around the central part of Stonehenge. There are also 30 of them, with one athwart each upright stone.\n\nStep 3: Match the given options with the correct terms for upright and horizontal stones.\nNow let's match the terms we identified for upright and horizontal stones with the given options.\n\n(A) legumes, sarsens\nLegumes are a type of plant nutrient and do not relate to Stonehenge; sarsens are a type of stone found at Stonehenge, but this option refers to two different types of stones.\n\n(B) lintels, stelae\nLintels are horizontal stone beams that rest on the upright stones above the outer ring; stelae are a type of upright stone found at Stonehenge. This option correctly identifies the type of horizontal stones (lintels) and the type of upright stones (stelae).\n\n(C) sarsens, lintels\nThis option repeats \"sarsens,\" which has already been used for one type of stone in an answer and incorrectly uses \"lintels\" for upright stones.\n\n(D) trilithon, tholoi\nTrilithons are the smaller structures made up of three upright stones and three horizontal stones in a specific arrangement, whereas tholoi are not associated with Stonehenge. This option is incorrect.\n\nStep 4: Determine the correct answer.\nBased on our analysis, option (B) lintels, stelae accurately identifies the upright stones (stelae) and the horizontal stones (lintels) at Stonehenge.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n(B) lintels, stelae",

Consider that bipedalism is largely linked with the evolution of the Homo genus, which is when human ancestors started walking on two legs, and it had a direct effect on how the mother gave birth. As the human brain size increased, the birth canal narrowed.\n\nStep 5: Understand that although (B) states this connection between bipedalism and an evolutionary solution, it doesn't mention the brain size correlation. In contrast, (C) not only states the connection between bipedalism and subsequent brain growth but also establishes a direct link to the evolutionary solution of altricial condition through the correlation between the brain size and the birth canal's narrowing.\n\nStep 6: Conclude by choosing option (C) as the answer, as it best explains the evolutionary solution of the altricial condition in modern human babies related to bipedalism and the changes in the birth canal.\n\nFinal output: C",
