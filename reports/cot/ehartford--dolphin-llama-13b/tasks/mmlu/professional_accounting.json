            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the estimated yearly yield on the limousine investment, we'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the daily rental revenue from renting the limousine for 2 hours a day at $245 per hour:\n   (2 hours/day) x (daily rate) = 2 x $245 = $490/day\n\n2. Calculate the yearly rental revenue by multiplying the daily revenue by the number of days in a year (including weekends and all festivities):\n   ($490/day) x (365 days/year) = $175,650 \n\n3. Subtract the initial cost of the limousine from the yearly rental revenue to get the estimated yearly yield (or profit):\n   ($175,650 - $98,000) = $77,650\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage of yearly yield:\n\n4. Divide the profit by the initial cost of the limousine, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n   ($77,650 / $98,000) x 100 = 0.7915\n\nNow we need to adjust for negative yield situation in the given options:\n\nSince a negative yield means the car is losing money, we have to find the closest option that represents the actual percentage, in which the yield is positive but really close to a negative value.\n\n Adjusted Options:\n \n (A) 164% is positive and is close enough to a negative yield \n \n (B) 1.64% is negative and misrepresents a loss on the investment\n \n (C) 0.45% is negative and misrepresents a loss on the investment\n \n (D) 183% is positive but much higher than the actual yield (0.7915)\n\nSo, the closest adjusted option is:\n\n(A) 164%",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the situation\n- Arno Co. didn't record a credit purchase of merchandise made before the year-end.\n- The merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory.\n\nStep 2: Identify the potential impact on the balance sheet\n- If the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory, it means that the merchandise is in the company's possession.\n\nStep 3: Determine the effect of the omission on the balance sheet\n- If the purchase was not reported, it might have led to the understated (lower than actual) value of assets, since the balance sheet would not show the full value of the merchandise. However, since the merchandise is correctly in the year-end physical inventory, that means the balance sheet already includes the value of the merchandise as it contributes to the inventory account.\n\nStep 4: Finalize the answer\n- The only effect the omission could have on the balance sheet is being understated.\n\nResult: (B) No effect No effect\n\nThe correct answer should be the combination of No effect and Understated. However, this option is not available in the given choices. Therefore, we'll choose the option that represents the only possible effect the omission could have had:\n\n(B) No effect Understated",

These events must be within a period that allows for their proper assessment and disclosure in the financial statements.\n- Comparing interim financial statements with the ones being audited is more related to the earlier stages of the audit process rather than a later assessment of the subsequent events.\n- Reviewing cutoff bank statements for several months after the end of the year would require considerable time and effort, not directly related to the auditor's assessment of the subsequent events.\n- Inspecting inventory and testing internal control activities are measures that can be implemented to ensure the adequacy of processes going forward. They are related to the auditor's approach to assessing the impact of subsequent events on the financial statements.\n\nStep 3: Choose the procedure most relevant to assessing subsequent events\nBased on the analysis, procedure (D) - Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited - stands out as the most relevant to auditing subsequent events.\n\nAnswer: D",

So, we have cash flows of $500 in years 5 and 10.\n\nStep 2: Calculate present value of cash flows\nWe discount future cash flows to their present value using the discount rate, which in this case is 10%. So we will use the formula:\nPresent Value (PV) = Future Value (FV) / (1 + Discount Rate)^Number of Years\n\nStep 3: Use the information provided to identify the factors to plug into the formula\nAccording to the problem:\n- The cash flow in year 5 is $500\n- The discount rate is 10%\n\nSo, the present value of cash flow in year 5 = $500 / (1 + 0.10)^1 = $500 / (1.10) = $454.56\n\nStep 4: Sum up the present values of cash flows to calculate the total present value\nSince there are two future cash flows, we sum them up:\nTotal Present Value (TPV) = $454.56 (Year 5) + $500 (Year 10) = $954.56\n\nStep 5: Calculate the NPV using TPV and discount rate\nNPV = TPV / (1 + Discount Rate)^Number of Years\nIn this case:\nNPV = $954.56 / (1 + 0.10)^2 = $954.56 / (1.10)^2 = $790.07\n\nStep 6: Match the answer to given options\nSince the NPV calculated is $790.07, none of the options (A) - (D) matches. However, we can assume that there might be an error in the options provided or any other assumptions in the problem, as the calculated NPV ($790.07) is not exactly equal to any of the options mentioned.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question\nThe question is asking how the following amounts would be affected by Dean using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the bond's premium. The amounts mentioned are bond carrying, retained amount, and earnings. The bond has a due date of July 1 year 12, but we need to find the effect on June 30 year 12.\n\nStep 2: Recall the difference between the methods\nThe straight-line method spreads the bond's premium over its life, while the effective interest method takes into account the time value of money and presents a more accurate representation of the bond's value over time.\n\nStep 3: Assess the impact on retained amount\nFor the retained amount, the straight-line method would make it appear as though more interest is earned than it actually is, because premium amortization with this method doesn't consider the time value of money. Therefore, the retained amount June 30 year 12 would be overstated (A).\n\nStep 4: Assess the impact on bond carrying\nSince bond carrying is an accounting concept that represents the face value of bonds minus their Cecil emission adjustment (CEA), it is unlikely to be affected by the method of amortizing premium. Therefore, bond carrying June 30 year 12 remains unaffected (D).\n\nStep 5: Assess the impact on earnings\nEarnings are the interest generated on a bond. Using the straight-line method to amortize the premium doesn't affect the interest calculations up to June 30 year 12. Thus, earnings are also not affected (D).\n\nFinal Answer: \nConsidering the reasoning in steps 3 to 5, the final answer should be (B) Understated Bond Carrying and (D) No effect for Retained Amount and Earnings.",

The face value of the bond is $100.\n2. The bond pays a 5% coupon, so for each coupon payment, the bondholder receives $5 (5% of $100).\n3. We have to calculate the number of coupon payments for a three-year bond.\n4. Since the bond has a 6% yield, the bond's current price will make an investor receive a 6% return over three years.\n\nNow calculating the number of coupon payments:\n\n1. A coupon period is one year, so for a three-year bond, there must be 3 coupon payments.\n\nNow calculating the price:\n\n1. Since the bond pays a $5 coupon each period, the total amount received over three periods would be $15 (5 coupon payments).\n\n2. The bond's current price should make an investor earn a 6% return over three years. Therefore, the bond price should be equal to the total amount received plus the face value of the bond: $15 + $100 = $115.\n\nHowever, among the given options, only option (B) $104.29 does not match the calculated price, so the correct answer should be the closest to the calculated price, which is (D) $97.33.",

The old building is not a current asset but rather a non-current asset because it is a property that has been used for a period of time and will not be converted into cash within one year.\n\n(C) It will no longer be depreciated.\nThis statement is incorrect.
