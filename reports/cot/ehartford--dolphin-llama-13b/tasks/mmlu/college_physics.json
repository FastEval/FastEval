In this case, \u03b7 = 0.1, which means the detector has a 10% chance of detecting a single photon, as 1 - \u03b7 = 0.9 (90% chance of not detecting the photon).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of detected photons for each attempt\nWe need to calculate the number of photons detected for 100 attempts, with each attempt having a probability of 10% (due to the 10% quantum efficiency) to detect a photon. \n\nThe probability of not detecting any photon in an attempt is 90%, which means that the probability of detecting a photon in one attempt is 10%.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of detected photons for 100 attempts\nUsing the binomial probability formula, we get:\n\nP(X = k) = (n! / (k!(n-k)!)) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- n = 100 attempts\n- p = 0.1 probability of detecting a photon in one attempt\n- q = 0.9 probability of not detecting a photon in one attempt\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nP(X = k) = (100! / (k!(100-k)!)) * (0.1^k) * (0.9^(100-k))\n\nTo find k, we solve for k in the equation:\n\nP(X = k) = 1 (1 photon detected means 100% success)\n\nk = 10\n\nTherefore, the detector will detect an average of 10 times (attempts) with an RMS deviation of about 0.3219 (between option A and B, considering that option B has a slightly smaller deviation).\n\nStep 5: Provide the answer\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) an average of 10 times, with an RMS deviation of about 3",

The amount of bending depends on the angle and the difference in the index of refraction.\n- When light travels from water to oil, it slows down again, but the angle of incidence is smaller, as the difference in the index of refraction between water and oil is smaller compared to that between air and water.\n- Due to Snell's Law, the angles of incidence and refraction are related.\n\nStep 3: Examine the reflection and transmission at the interfaces\n- The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of refraction. For the light to be reflected, the angle must be greater than the critical angle, which can be calculated using Snell's Law.\n- For the light to be transmitted, the angle must be less than the critical angle.\n- At the water-air interface, the angle must be greater than the critical angle for reflection, and less than the critical angle for transmission.\n- At the water-oil interface, similar conditions apply.\n\nStep 4: Find the most strongly reflected wavelength\n- Since the oil has a higher index of refraction (1.5) compared to water (1.33), the light hitting the oil-water interface will have a smaller angle for transmission.\n- Consequently, the wavelength that will be most strongly reflected is the one that corresponds to the transmission angle where the ordinary ray intersects the surface.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n(A) 500 nm -> This wavelength will not be strongly reflected, as it corresponds to the transmission angle.\n(B) 550 nm -> This wavelength will be strongly reflected, as it corresponds to the critical angle for the water-air interface.\n(C) 600 nm -> This wavelength will not be strongly reflected, as it corresponds to the transmission angle.\n(D) 650 nm -> This wavelength will not be strongly reflected, as it corresponds to the transmission angle.\n\nTherefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength is 550 nm (B).",

            "model_answer": "(C) The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.\n\nReasoning:\nIn a reversible thermodynamic process, the system and its surroundings do not experience any internal energy exchanges due to the assumption that the system is isolated from the surroundings. So, the First Law of Thermodynamics does not apply, and no work is done. Because entropy is related to the number of possible arrangements of particles and can only increase in an isolated system, a thermodynamic process must be irreversible for entropy to increase.\n\nIf the process were irreversible, then there would be energy exchanges between the system and its surroundings, causing a change in entropy for both the system and its environment. However, since the question states the process is reversible, this implies that there is no heat transfer, and entropy does not change for either the system or its environment.

We know that twice the particle's rest energy is equal to its total energy. The rest energy can be found using the equation E\u2080 = mc\u00b2, where E\u2080 is rest energy and m is the mass of the particle.\n\n3.
