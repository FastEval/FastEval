            "question": "The ecological approach to urban sociology involved studying:\n\n(A) how social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources\n(B) the forms of wildlife and natural habitats that could be found on the edges of the city\n(C) the way in which people organized collective protests about environmental issues\n(D) how men and women used the city's public spaces differently",

            "model_answer": "Firstly, let's break down the options given and analyze each option one by one in relation to the ecological approach to urban sociology. \n\n(A) This option involves studying the competition for resources and colonization of social groups in different city areas. This concept aligns with the ecological approach to urban sociology as it explores connections between social dynamics and the environment. \n\n(B) This option focuses on the wildlife and natural habitats found on the city's outskirts. Although this may be relevant to ecology, it does not directly address the city sociology aspect in an urban context. Therefore, this option is less likely.\n\n(C) We have an option involving the organization of collective protests about environmental issues. While this might be relevant to ecological studies, it does not directly address urban sociology, and therefore, might not be the best answer.\n\n(D) Finally, we have an option that focuses on the differences in the use of public spaces by men and women. While it does involve people's behavior within the city, it does not directly relate to urban ecology issues. \n\nBased on the analysis above, the ecological approach to urban sociology is most closely related to option (A) as it connects social groups, their colonization, and the competition for resources within an urban context. \n\nAnswer: (A)",

            "question": "Becker proclaimed that cannabis use was:\n\n(A) increasing throughout all sections of youth in the 1970s\n(B) learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career\n(C) a dangerous pastime that young people should not be allowed to pursue\n(D) not as enjoyable as other sociologists had suggested",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze the question and the given options step-by-step. \n\n1. The question asks about Becker's perspective on cannabis use. \n2. Becker is a well-known criminologist, and while he has studied various aspects of crime and social issues, his most famous book, \"Revolutionary Change,\" is not directly related to cannabis use or drug behavior. However, it is crucial to consider his general views on social processes, crime, and deviance in the context of our analysis.\n3. Analyzing each option, now:\n\nOption A: This option seems unlikely since Becker's primary focus is on crime and deviance rather than drug use or trends, especially targeting specific demographics.\n\nOption B: This option implies that Becker might view cannabis use as a result of the social processes related to a deviant career, making it a plausible choice.\n\nOption C: This view is contrary to Becker's perspectives because he believed that individuals should be free to pursue their own interests, even those that are considered risky or deviant.\n\nOption D: This choice is improbable, as it is more likely that Becker would be focused on understanding the experiences of individuals rather than making judgments about the enjoyment of a particular activity.\n\nAfter analyzing the options, it becomes clear that option B best represents Becker's perspective in the context of the question. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Let's analyze each option one-by-one.\n\nOption A: The middle classes over the nineteenth century were indeed an urban set, as industrialization and urbanization progressed, leading to the growth of cities. They were involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations, which allowed them to participate in public life and express their interests.\n\nOption B: It's true that the middle classes were too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness, as their members belonged to different occupations, geographical locations, and social backgrounds.\n\nOption C: Many middle-class individuals were involved in 'white-collar' work, as industrialization created new types of jobs in areas such as management, administration, professionals, technicians, etc.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate if all the options (A, B, and C) are true, or if any are false, and consider whether D is applicable.\n\nAll the options A, B, and C are true, and none of them contradicts the other. \n\nStep 3: Determine the appropriate response.\n\nBased on the analysis, all the options given are true, so the final answer is:\n\n(D) all of the above",

Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies developed the concept of gemeinschaft to contrast it with another concept.\n\nNow let's examine each of the options to find the one that is most closely related to gemeinschaft:\n\n(A) Organic solidarity - This refers to a strong social bond among community members. It's more akin to gemeinschaft as it involves close relationships.\n\n(B) Mechanical solidarity - This concept refers to a society where individuals are interchangeable parts that fit together. This is the opposite of gemeinschaft, as it doesn't focus on personal relationships.\n\n(C) Gesellschaft - This term, also coined by T\u00f6nnies, refers to a society characterized by loose connections, individualism, and formal rules. Whilegesellschaft is the opposite of gemeinschaft, it is not what the question is asking for.\n\n(D) Anomie - This term, coined by \u00c9mile Durkheim, refers to a society where social bonds are weak, and there is a lack of common values. Anomie is not the opposite of gemeinschaft and doesn't describe the same relational characteristics.\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer is:\n\n(A) organic solidarity",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option one by one and then determine the correct answer.\n\n(A) Rates of income tax increased equally for all occupational groups - This option suggests that the income tax rates were increased proportionately for all types of jobs. This would lead to a more balanced income distribution and would not contribute to an increase in income inequality.\n\n(B) There were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them - If there were more professional jobs available, but a lack of people to fill them, it would create a shortage of skilled workers. This actually might lead to higher salaries and benefits for those professionals, thereby decreasing income inequality instead of increasing it.\n\n(C) The price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings - If the price of consumer goods increased while earnings remained stagnant or grew at a slower rate, the purchasing power of people would be reduced. This would create a growing income inequality as people with higher incomes were able to afford better living conditions and more goods.\n\n(D) Growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits - Growing unemployment would increase the number of people relying on welfare benefits, leading to a greater income disparity as fewer individuals would have additional income sources.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, option (C) the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings, best explains the cause of growth in income inequality during the 1980s. \n\nAnswer: (C)",

This means that the act is no longer considered as deviant over time, as more people come to accept it as part of societal norms.\n\n(B) This option suggests that a deviant act is seen as a temporary aberration from what is considered 'normal.' However, normalization implies that the act becomes acceptable over time, and this option contradicts the normalization process.\n\n(C) Normalization does not mean that the act is the first step in establishing a deviant career. Rather, it implies that the act becomes acceptable eventually.\n\n(D) While genetic or anatomical makeup may contribute to certain deviations, this option suggests that normalization occurs due to these factors. However, normalization also involves societal acceptance, making this option less accurate.\n\nBased on my reasoning, I conclude that if a deviant act is 'normalized,' it is:\n\n(A) recognized as breaking an important norm of behavior.",
