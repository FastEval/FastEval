            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the problem. A field extension is a mathematical concept where a new field is constructed from an existing field by adding a set of new elements. In this case, we are given the field extension Q(\u221a(2), \u221a(3), \u221a(18)) over the existing field Q. We are asked to find the degree of this field extension.\n\nStep 1: Recalling basic concepts - The degree of a field extension is defined as the exponent of the denominator of any nonzero element in the extension, in terms of any basis of the extension.\n\nStep 2: Finding the element that defines the extension - The field extension is defined over Q, which are complex numbers. Analyzing the given elements in the extension, we have:\n\u221a(2) + \u221a(3)i + \u221a(18)j\n\nStep 3: In this case, the extension has basis size = 3: one real element (\u221a(2)) and two imaginary elements (\u221a(3), \u221a(18)). Since all elements are new, the degree of the extension is equal to the basis size.\n\nStep 4: Calculating the degree - The degree of the extension is 3.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n(B) 3",

An ideal in R is a subset of R that is closed under the ring operations.\n\nNow, let's check if the statements are true or false:\n\nStatement 1 is true because, in a ring homomorphism, if the kernel is {0}, then it means that each element in the domain is mapped to a unique element in the codomain, and there exists at most one element in the codomain mapping to each element in the domain (which is the definition of a one-to-one function).\n\nHowever, Statement 2 is false because Q cannot be an ideal in R. A ring homomorphism is a function from a ring to a ring or to a field, whereas an ideal is a subset of a ring under the same operation.
