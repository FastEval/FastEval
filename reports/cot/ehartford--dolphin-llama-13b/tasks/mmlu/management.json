Again, it doesn't necessarily capture the normative aspect, as normative perspective involves setting standards or norms.\n\n(C) The way things should be: This option reflects setting standards, norms, or values that could guide the way decisions should be made. This corresponds to the concept of a normative perspective.\n\n(D) The way things were: This option refers to past events or circumstances. It doesn't relate to setting norms or standards and hence doesn't capture the essence of a normative perspective.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) The way things should be.",

The potential for entry into the industry: This force refers to the possibility of new competitors entering the market and increasing the competitive intensity.\n2. The threat of substitute products: This force refers to the possibility of potential customers turning to alternative products or services that could fulfill its needs but are not exactly the same as the ones being offered in the market.\n3. The power of customers: This force refers to the bargaining power of end customers, in terms of the prices they are willing to pay for the products and services offered.\n4. The level of rivalry: This force examines the competitive behavior among existing firms in the industry.\n\nNow, considering the type of competitive activity that exists between organizations, we can conclude that it is (D) The level of rivalry because answering this question requires assessing the level of competition and struggle among existing businesses in the context of the five forces model.",
