            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first discuss each fuzzer style:\n\n(A) Generational fuzzers use a combination of randomly generated inputs and feedback loops to augment the input space and find new, potentially different inputs. They continue to refine their inputs over multiple generations. This style can cover many different parts of the code.\n\n(B) Blackbox testers only consider the input and output interactions to find new inputs. They don't modify the input directly, and their primary concern is finding critical paths and error handling. They can't explore many different parts of the program.\n\n(C) Whitebox testers use extensive knowledge of the source code structure and control flow to find new inputs. They may not find coverage for every single line of code but focus on the important parts.\n\n(D) Mutation-based fuzzers modify the input data in various ways to create new inputs. They might introduce random changes or transform the input format to vary the possible inputs without the need for external information or strategy.\n\nFrom the above explanations, it can be concluded that:\n- Generational fuzzers are more likely to explore paths covering every line of code due to the combination of randomly generated inputs and feedback loops.\n- Blackbox testers don't cover many parts of the code since they only consider input-output interactions.\n- Whitebox testers focus on important parts rather than covering every line of code.\n- Mutation-based fuzzers tend to focus on modifying inputs but don't guarantee exploration of every line of the code.\n\nSo the answer is (A) Generational, as it is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the program.",

            "question": "Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don\u2019t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through the scenarios and what TLS protects against in each case:\n\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier: This scenario can be associated with a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where an attacker tries to intercept and replay the client's data to the server. However, TLS protects against this by using message authentication codes (MACs) to verify the integrity and authenticity of the data being transmitted.\n\n2. An attacker impersonating the server: This scenario can be considered as a type of MITM attack where the attacker tries to impersonate the server to grab sensitive information from the client. TLS protects against this by ensuring that the client and server have authenticated each other through a proper key exchange, thus making it more difficult for an attacker to impersonate the server.\n\nWithout the need for overly complex explanations, based on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) True, False",

What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",

When a client connects to a server and presents an expired ticket, the server compares the timestamp on the ticket with its own clock. If the ticket has already expired (meaning its timestamp is in the past), the server refuses to authenticate the user. This helps ensure an expired ticket cannot be used.",

It is also not as widespread as other options.\n\n(B) Buffer-overrun: Buffer-overrun errors occur when a program tries to access memory locations that are out of bounds, potentially leading to data leaks or crashes.

It does not relate to exploiting mistakes in an app to compromise a system.\n\n(D) Inefficient programming: While inefficient programming can lead to poor performance, it is not a specific coding mistake like the others mentioned.

If the two parties are not joined, the DH method may not be properly applied.\n\nB) Authenticated - This means parties have confirmed each other's identity through an authentication process. In any key exchange protocol, ensuring the other party is genuine is crucial to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nC) Submitted - This implies that the parties, at some point, have given in or yielded in some form. However, it does not directly relate to the security of the DH method in the context of the man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nD) Shared - This means the parties have not shared any information or secret key.
