            "model_answer": "To find the P-value of the hypothesis test, we can analyze the data and use the appropriate statistical test. The claim of the manufacturer is that the mean weight of their aspirin tablets is 300 milligrams.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the sample mean of the seven tablets' weights\n(299 + 300 + 305 + 302 + 299 + 301 + 303) / 7 = 2000 / 7 \u2248 286.28\n\nStep 2: Determine the variability of the sample data\nVariance: (variance of continuous variables: mean of the squared differences from the mean) \nVariance = (300 - 299)^2 + (305 - 300)^2 + (302 - 300)^2 + (299 - 300)^2 + (301 - 300)^2 + (303 - 300)^2\nVariance = (1)^2 + (5)^2 + (5)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (3)^2 + (1)^2 \u2248 256\n\nStep 3: Calculate the critical value from the empirical distribution of the means of the t-distribution\nQuantiles from the T distribution, Investments, and Categorical Data, 2nd Ed., by Bruce M.

The mean waiting time for a new roller coaster ride is 35 minutes.\n2. The standard deviation of waiting times is 10 minutes.\n\nWe can use the formula for the area under a normal distribution curve:\n\nArea = (mean * standard deviation) * (2 * pi) / (3 * diagonal)\n\nWe want to find the time interval boundaries for the area under the curve up to 100,000 riders (since the question is about the shortest interval).\n\nUsing the formula and given values:\n\nMean = 35\nStandard deviation = 10\n\nArea = (35 * 10) * (2 * pi) / (3 * diag) = 350\n\nLower bound:\n1.5 * standard deviation above the mean = 1.5 * 10 = 15\n\nLower bound = 35 + 15 = 50 minutes\n\nUpper bound:\n1.5 * standard deviation below the mean = 1.5 * (-10) = -15\n\nSince negative times don't make sense, we need at least one minute to accommodate the first rider.\n\nUpper bound = minimum of 1 and lower bound - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49 minutes\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the shortest interval, and it involves equality, we need to check if there's any other interval that fits within the given range. We need to look at the intervals that are symmetric around the mean.\n\nIf we take half of the upper bound:\n\nUpper bound interval: 1 since 49 is the next multiple of 1 after 45\n\nMinimum of 49 and 45 is 45 minutes.\n\nHowever, since we want to consider all riders equally, we should find the time interval boundaries that include both 100,000 riders and 150,000 riders.\n\nFor 150,000 riders, upper bound is the same as 100,000 riders:\n\nUpper bound = 49 minutes\n\nFor 100,000 riders, lower bound is half of the included range (150,000 riders) minus 1:\n\nLower bound = 75 - 1 = 74 minutes\n\nNow, we find the time interval that includes both the lower and upper bound:\n\nLower bound: 74 minutes\nUpper bound: 49 minutes\n\nThe shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is 25.3 to 44.7 minutes and is option (C).",
