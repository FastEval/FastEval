So option (A) is true.\n\n(B) It is believed that Type-Ia supernovae occur in galaxies that contain a significant amount of ongoing star formation, which could be considered young in the context of a galaxy's life cycle. Thus, option (B) is also true.\n\n(C) While not exclusively, many Type-Ia supernovae are associated with the explosion of a white dwarf and a companion star, which could involve a disrupted website. However, it's not guaranteed. Therefore, option (C) is false.\n\n(D) Type-Ia supernovae do produce some X-rays due to their explosion, but their primary characteristics lie in their optical brightness and not their X-ray emission. Thus, option (D) is not the best answer.\n\nTaking all these answers into consideration,\nOption (A) - This type occurs in binary systems.\nOption (B) - This type occurs in young galaxies.\nis true, while the other options are false.",

Therefore, we cannot estimate its speed based on actual and apparent brightness alone.\n\nB) The actual brightness of an object depends on factors like its temperature, color, and reflectivity. The apparent brightness depends on the observer's position and the object's intrinsic brightness. Since we only have information on the object's brightness and our position, we cannot determine its composition.\n\nC) To estimate the size of an object, we would need information on its angular diameter or an idea of its shape or dimensions. Although we know the object's brightness, there is not enough information to determine its size.\n\nD) The apparent brightness of an object is determined by the amount of light it reflects, emits, and scatters from its surface in relation to our position. If we also know the actual brightness of the object, we have enough information to estimate its distance from us using the Inverse Square Law. The dimmer it appears, the farther away it is; the brighter it appears, the closer it is.\n\nStep 3: Provide the final answer.\n\nBased on our evaluation, with the given information, we can estimate:\n(D) Its distance from you",

However, it is not the only moon in the outer solar system with a thick atmosphere. Jupiter's moon, Europa, also has a thick atmosphere.\n\n(B) Titan is the only outer solar system moon with evidence for recent geologic activity.\nRecent studies have suggested that there might be signs of geologic activity, such as ice volcanoes, on Titan. So far, no other moon in the outer solar system has such clear evidence of contemporary geologic activity.\n\n(C) Titan's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrocarbons.\nTitan's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen, with trace amounts of other gases including methane and ethane (which are hydrocarbons).\n\nWe now have information on all three statements.\n\nBased on this information, the answer is:\n\n(D) A and D\n\nThis is because Statement (A) is true, Titan is the only outer solar system moon with a thick atmosphere aside from Europa, and Statement (B) is true, there is evidence for recent geologic activity on Titan.
