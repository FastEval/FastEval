            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question by interpreting the terms in the question.\n\nA Robertsonian translocation is a type of chromosomal rearrangement where a chromosome break occurs in the middle of a homologous chromosome pair, mutually exclusive to each other. The other end of the broken chromosome is attached to another chromosome, creating a structurally unbalanced karyotype.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given options and understand the role each plays in chromosomal structure.\n\n(A) Telomeres: These are the repetitive DNA sequences located at the ends of chromosomes that prevent them from deteriorating or fusing with neighboring chromosomes.\n(B) Centromeres: They are the constricted regions of a chromosome that play a crucial role in ensuring equal separation of homologous pairs during cell division.\n(C) Histones: These are the positively charged proteins found in eukaryotic cells that package DNA into structural units called nucleosomes.\n(D) Ends of the long arms: In most cases, chromosomal translocations occur within the \"arms\" of chromosomes, thus the ends of the long arms denote the sites where the translocation takes place.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate which option makes the most sense for where fusion occurs in a Robertsonian translocation.\n\nGiven the explanation above, a Robertsonian translocation denotes the fusion of chromosomes at their \"ends of the long arms\" since it involves the transfer of one chromosome to another within the same pair.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) ends of the long arms.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we first need to understand the inheritance pattern of X-linked recessive conditions, which will allow us to determine the frequency of affected females.\n\n1. X-linked recessive conditions are controlled by genes located on the X chromosome.\n2. Males only have one X chromosome, so they can inherit a recessive condition if they get the recessive allele from both parents.\n3. Females have two X chromosomes, so they need to inherit two copies of the recessive allele to have the condition.\n4. Since males account for half of the children born in a population, we know that 50% of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition will be female siblings or offspring of the affected males.\n\nNow we can calculate the expected frequency of affected females:\n\n1. The frequency of males affected is 0.1 (10%).\n2. Since the affected males have female siblings or offspring (50% of them), the frequency of females affected is half of the males affected: 0.05 (5%).\n3. To express the result as a percentage of the total female population, we have to divide by the total number of females in the population: 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 or 2.5%.\n\nNonetheless, considering the answer choices given, the closest option to 2.5% is:\n\nAnswer: (C) 0.02",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "First, let's go through the definitions of each pattern of inheritance to see which one matches malignant hyperthermia:\n\n(A) Autosomal dominant: This pattern of inheritance occurs when a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to produce the dominant trait. The offspring has a 50% chance of inheriting the dominant trait in each pregnancy.\n\n(B) Autosomal recessive: This pattern of inheritance occurs when both copies of the mutated gene must be inherited to produce the recessive trait. The offspring has a 25% chance of inheriting the recessive trait in each pregnancy if both parents carry the mutated gene.\n\n(C) X-linked dominant: This pattern of inheritance occurs when a male inherits one copy of the mutated gene and one normal gene, while a female inherits two normal genes. The male is always affected but females can be carriers. If a female inherits the mutated gene, she will be a carrier but will not be affected herself.\n\n(D) X-linked recessive: This pattern of inheritance occurs when both copies of the mutated gene must be inherited to produce the recessive trait. This pattern is not typical for X-linked recessive, in which both males and females can be affected if they inherit the mutated genes.\n\nMalignant hyperthermia is a rare disorder characterized by an extreme and potentially life-threatening reaction to certain drugs, most commonly anesthetics, that cause the body temperature to rise dramatically. Therefore, this pattern of inheritance would be similar to X-linked recessive where both copies of the mutated gene must be inherited to produce the recessive trait. In this case, it implies that the gene mutation causing malignant hyperthermia is located on the X chromosome.\n\nThus, the answer to the question is:\n\n(D) X-linked recessive.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we must first analyze each option and determine which statement is most accurate regarding the mapping of human chromosomes. Let's go through each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) says that the mapping is restricted to sex chromosomes because of small family sizes. While this may be true to some extent, mapping has not only focused on sex chromosomes, so this option may not adequately represent the whole picture.\n\n(B) states that the process has succeeded more as large numbers of DNA markers became available. This is accurate, as advancements in molecular genetics and the availability of DNA markers have helped improve mapping techniques.\n\n(C) asserts that the number of linkage groups is about twice the number of chromosomes. This is not accurate, as the number of linkage groups is less than half the number of chromosomes, as linkage groups represent the interactions between genes and marker genes on chromosomes.\n\n(D) claims that almost all the DNA is involved in coding for genes. While many genes are indeed located on DNA, not all DNA is involved in gene coding. Some parts of the genome are non-coding regions, and thus not all of the DNA is focused on coding for genes.\n\nAfter going step-by-step through each option, only option (B) accurately describes the progress made in the mapping of human chromosomes due to the availability of large numbers of DNA markers.\n\nFinal answer: B",

Consider the mode of transmission:\n- PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the defective gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition.\n\n3. Assess the risk of abnormality in the child:\n- If both parents have PKU, there is a 25% chance their child will inherit two normal copies of the gene and a 75% chance their child will inherit two defective copies.\n- Since the child needs to inherit two defective copies to develop PKU, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU would be:\n\nAnswer: (C) 25%",
