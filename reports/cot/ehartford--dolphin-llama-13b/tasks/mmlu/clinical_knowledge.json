            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first review the information provided and then evaluate each gauge size.\n\nA rapid blood transfusion is necessary in cases where a patient is experiencing severe hemorrhage or needs a significant amount of blood replacement. The size of the cannula is crucial to ensure minimal resistance during the transfusion and to avoid causing discomfort or pain to the patient.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each gauge size:\n\n(A) 18 gauge - An 18 gauge needle is quite large and typically used for intravenous (IV) catheter placement. It would likely be too large for a patient in need of a rapid blood transfusion.\n\n(B) 20 gauge - A 20 gauge needle is slightly smaller than an 18 gauge needle but still larger than the gauge sizes we will consider next. Due to its larger size, the 20 gauge may not be ideal for rapid blood transfusion.\n\n(C) 22 gauge - A 22 gauge needle is smaller and more appropriate for rapid blood transfusion because it will cause less pain, discomfort, and resistance when inserted. Additionally, the 22 gauge will aid in a smoother and faster blood transfusion procedure.\n\n(D) 24 gauge - A 24 gauge needle is even smaller than the 22 gauge and may cause more pain, discomfort, and resistance when inserted. It would not be ideal for a rapid blood transfusion.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the best size of cannula to use in a patient who needs a rapid blood transfusion as of 2020 medical knowledge is:\n\n(C) 22 gauge.",

A well-rounded runner should focus on all aspects, not just strength.\n\n(B) Power: Power is crucial for short sprints but not as much in longer-distance races like marathons. In marathons, endurance is more important.\n\n(C) Stride Length: Stride length can be helpful, but it is crucial to strike a balance between stride length and frequency to maintain an efficient pace throughout the race.\n\n(D) Stamina: Stamina plays a critical role in marathon running, as it allows runners to maintain a consistent pace and conserve energy throughout the race.\n\nBased on this analysis, the key attribute in successful marathon running is:\n\n(D) Stamina.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's evaluate each option and understand their relationship to closed pouches.\n\n(A) The patient has a semi-formed or liquid output.\nA closed pouch could be applied to protect the skin and collect semiformed or liquid output. Patients with conditions like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis may experience this type of output.\n\n(B) The patient has a colostomy.\nA colostomy is a surgical procedure where the end of the colon is brought through an opening in the abdominal wall. A closed pouch may be used after a colostomy to help collect waste and protect the skin.\n\n(C) In the immediate post-operative period.\nAfter surgery, particularly colorectal surgery, a closed pouch may be used for a period to help the patient feel more comfortable and to protect the surgical site.\n\n(D) The patient has a urostomy.\nA urostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an opening for the urinary tract to bypass the bladder. Closed pouches are not commonly used in this case, as other devices like a nephrostomy bag are more appropriate for collecting urine.\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, we can conclude that the correct answer is:\n\n(B) The patient has a colostomy.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n1. Anaerobic contribution: Sprints are short-duration, high-intensity exercises that rely on anaerobic metabolism as the primary energy source. So, it is possible that the anaerobic contribution increases as the number of sprints increases.\n\n2. pH of the muscle: The pH of muscle doesn't directly change with the number of sprints. It depends on the type of exercise performed, duration, muscle fatigue, and other factors. \n\n3. Blood glucose concentration: Sprints may temporarily cause a drop in blood glucose concentration due to the body using glucose for energy. However, this effect is more related to individual factors, like the person's diet or their body's glucose regulation, rather than the number of sprints.\n\n4. Relative contribution of aerobic metabolism: Sprints are largely anaerobic but might involve some aerobic components. As the number of sprints increases, the body might shift to use more aerobic metabolism to recover and replenish glycogen stores between sprints.\n\nConsidering these points, option (A) anaerobic contribution progressively increases seems to have the most direct and reasonable correlation with increasing the number of sprints.\n\nFinal answer: (A) anaerobic contribution progressively increases.",

            "model_answer": "I will analyze each statement, and then choose the correct option.\n\n(A) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered\n- This is not true. If an eye is covered, it can still cause diplopia if the other eye compensates by producing an extra image.\n\n(B) The outer image is always the false image\n- This is not true either. Diplopia occurs when an individual sees two images of a single object, and these images may be either outer images (created by misaligned vision in the eye) or inner images (created by misaligned eye alignment).\n\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards\n- This is not accurate. A fourth nerve palsy, or optic nerve palsy, affects the vision in a similar way to a sixth nerve palsy (globus pallidus). However, it isn't specifically related to looking upwards.\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint\n- This is true! A sixth nerve palsy, also known as internuclear ophthalmoplegia, causes a divergent squint or an outward deviation of the eyes. This occurs because the misalignment of the eyes results from the abnormal functioning of the nerves that control eye movement.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct option is:\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint",

            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Buffers help maintain a stable pH in the extracellular fluid, and sodium bicarbonate works as a buffer. This means that it would increase the pH and buffering capacity, allowing faster efflux of hydrogen ions from the muscle, thus improving running performance.\n\n(B) This option is the opposite of option A. Reducing pH and buffering capacity would cause hydrogen ions to accumulate, which would be detrimental for muscle function.\n\n(C) This statement is similar to option A, but instead of efflux, it mentions influx of hydrogen ions into muscle. However, sodium bicarbonate works to increase the pH and buffering capacity to aid in efflux, so this choice is incorrect.\n\n(D) Elevating pre-exercise muscle pH could be a benefit, but it doesn't directly track with ebifactation improvements that sodium bicarbonate provides.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most accurate choice is:\n\n(A) Elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.",
