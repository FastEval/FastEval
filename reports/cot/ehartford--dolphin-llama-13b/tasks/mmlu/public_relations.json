            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step:\n\nStep 1: Understand the concept of the 'spiral of silence'\nThe spiral of silence is a phenomenon in which people's self-censorship and the censorship of others, in private or public communication, exacerbate an existing silence around important societal issues. Silence is maintained because individuals perceive the environment as unfavorable to the open expression of their opinions and views.\n\nStep 2: Compare the definitions given to the concept of 'spiral of silence'\n\n(A) When victims of abuse remain silent about the abuse - This definition could be related to the overall silence around abuse and may play a factor in perpetuating the 'spiral of silence,' but it is not a comprehensive description of the concept.\n\n(B) When people hide their opinions if they do not agree with the majority - This definition aligns with the idea of the spiral of silence, where individuals might withhold their opinions if they feel others do not agree with them, resulting in self-censorship and further reinforcing the silence.\n\n(C) When people hide their opinions if they are in disagreement with their close peers or family members - This description is similar to option B, but it focuses more specifically on hide one's opinions from those close to them.\n\n(D) When public relations uses opinion poll results to generate support for a particular issue - This definition does not seem to be related to the concept of the spiral of silence.\n\nStep 3: Identify the best option based on the comparisons made\n\nBased on the comparisons above, Option (B) best describes the 'spiral of silence,' as it explains a situation where individuals withhold their opinions because they believe they do not align with the majority.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

Parkinson and Ekachai (2006) model: This model highlights the dynamic nature of strategic management, consisting of strategy development, execution, monitoring, measurement, and review.\n\nAnalyzing these planning models, we can observe that the common elements present in all four models are: Strategy (formulation, implementation, and development) and Evaluation (monitoring, measurement, and assessment of the strategic plan).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Objectives and implementation",
