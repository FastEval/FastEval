            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let us first go through the possible options step-by-step:\n\nA) If there is a lesion causing compression of the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen, it will cause ipsilateral paralysis of the facial muscles. This sounds like a reasonable outcome.\n\nB) Since this option also mentions loss of taste, this could be a potential consequence if the facial nerve issue affects the person's ability to taste.\n\nC) Adding lacrimation (lacrimal gland secretion of tears) to the mixture seems reasonable as well. However, decreased salivation is not mentioned in the context of facial nerve compression and is therefore not a direct result.\n\nD) This option lists not only paralysis of the facial muscles and loss of taste, but also lacrimation and decreased salivation. Decreased salivation is not directly related to facial nerve compression, so we can eliminate this option.\n\nAfter analyzing the given options step-by-step, we arrive at a single option that directly addresses the question:\n\n(A) paralysis of the facial muscles.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) A protruding mandible due to reactivation of the condylar cartilage by acromegaly. \nA dished face usually refers to a face with a depressed appearance in the middle, particularly in the area between the eyes (nasio-maxillary furrow). Acromegaly is a condition causing enlargement of facial features due to overproduction of growth hormone and not related to a nasio-maxillary depression.\n\n(B) A recessive maxilla due to failure of elongation of the cranial base. \nA recessive maxilla would result in a prominent maxilla, causing an protruding appearance of the face, which doesn't match the dished face profile. \n\n(C) An enlarged frontal bone due to hydrocephaly. \nHydrocephalus is a medical condition that results in an enlarged head size due to excessive fluid accumulation in the ventricles of the brain. Although it can be related to facial abnormalities, it doesn't specifically cause a dished face profile.\n\n(D) Defective development of the maxillary air sinus. \nA defective development of the maxillary air sinus could cause changes in facial appearance, but it's not primarily associated with a dished face profile.\n\nTherefore, none of the provided options accurately relate to a dished face profile.",

While it is involved in the blood filtration in the nephron, it doesn't fit the description of the cluster of blood capillaries in each nephron.\n\n(B) Glomerulus: The glomerulus is the cluster of blood capillaries found in each nephron in the kidney. Capillaries are small blood vessels that connect arterial and venous vessels. The glomerulus is where the blood is filtered to remove water, salts, and waste products. Thus, this option matches the description we are looking for.\n\n(C) Loop of Henle: The Loop of Henle is a part of the nephron involved in filtering and reabsorbing water and salts from the glomerular filtrate.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the impact of a broken neck with damage to the spinal cord at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra on a person's ability to breathe.\n\nStep 1: Identify the role of the cervical vertebrae in the human body. The cervical vertebrae make up the first seven vertebrae in the spinal column and are responsible for supporting the head and neck.\n\nStep 2: Relate the cervical vertebrae to the respiratory system. The cervical vertebrae provide a pathway for the spinal cord, which relays signals between the brain and the rest of the body, including the muscles used for breathing.\n\nStep 3: Consider the effect of a broken neck and spinal cord damage on the spinal cord. If the spinal cord is damaged, the signals sent to the muscles involved in breathing may be compromised.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the potential consequences of compromised signals to the muscles involved in breathing. If the signals are altered, the muscles responsible for initiating inhalation and exhalation may not function properly, which could lead to difficulties in breathing.\n\nOn the basis of this reasoning, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n(A) They will be unable to breathe without life support.",
