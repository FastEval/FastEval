            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, I will first examine each method and determine if it involves exposure to radiation.\n\n(A) Needle aspiration - This method involves taking a sample of breast tissue using a needle. No radiation is involved in this procedure.\n\n(B) Mammography - Mammography involves using low-dose X-rays to examine breast tissue for signs of cancer. Although there is some exposure to radiation, the dose is minimal and the benefits of early detection outweigh the risks.\n\n(C) Mastectomy - This is a surgical procedure where the breast is removed to treat breast cancer. It does not involve radiation exposure.\n\n(D) Lumpectomy - Lumpectomy is a surgical procedure in which breast tissue is removed to treat cancer, but the breast is left intact. It doesn't involve radiation exposure.\n\nAfter examining each method, I can now provide the answer:\n\n(B) Mammography",

            "model_answer": "First, let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) Varying from person to person means that what is sexually exciting for one person might not be for another. This is true, as individual preferences differ.\n\n(B) Women's sexual excitement can vary depending on the phases of the menstrual cycle. During certain phases, such as around ovulation, women may experience increased arousal and sexual desire.\n\n(C) There are certain parts of the body, mainly on the lower portion, that are more commonly regarded as sexually exciting. This is valid and relates to the concept of erogenous zones.\n\nUpon examining all the options, we can see that they all contain a portion of the truth with regard to the sexual excitation of body regions. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) All of the above",

            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each option one by one:\n\n(A) Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection that can be treated with antibiotics. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n(B) Gonorrhea has a high risk of infection with a single exposure, but this is not always true. Depending on the specific type of gonorrhea and some individual factors, multiple exposures might be necessary for transmission. Hence, this statement is not universally true.\n\n(C) While some individuals may exhibit no symptoms initially, a significant percentage of those infected with gonorrhea do display symptoms within a few weeks to months after exposure. Therefore, this statement is not entirely true.\n\n(D) Gonorrhea infections are primarily genital (affecting the penis, vagina, cervix, uterus, or fallopian tubes), but it's not limited to these areas only. It can sometimes affect other genital structures and, in rare cases, can spread to eyes and joints through oral sex or sharing needles, respectively. So, this statement is not completely true.\n\nTaking all of the above into account, the only statement that is universally true about gonorrhea is that it can be treated with antibiotics (Option A).",

            "question": "You are a homosexual male: Last night, you were tempted by lusty, swarthy Jacques (the king of fraternity row) to join him at the local dairy bar for a tall cool glass of milk. You also briefly considered studying for this test, but Jacques won out. In Freudian terms, which of the following was dominant?\n\n(A) the id\n(B) the ego\n(C) the superego\n(D) the Oedipus complex",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first review the components of Freud's personality theory and their characteristics:\n\n(A) the id - the driving force behind behavior, dominated by immediate pleasure and satisfaction, shaped by early childhood experiences and the absence of external consequences.\n\n(B) the ego - the mediator between the id and the superego, concerned with balancing immediate gratification with long-term goals and societal expectations.\n\n(C) the superego - the moral component of personality, involving self-critical and moral standards, formed by internalizing parental values and societal rules.\n\n(D) the Oedipus complex - a term used to describe the unconscious fantasy interactions between boys and their parents, involving feelings of rivalry and desire for possession of the parent, which is especially significant during early childhood and adolescence.\n\nNow let's consider the situation provided: Our homosexual male protagonist was tempted by Jacques, who represents immediate pleasure and lust. Jacques is described as the \"king of fraternity row,\" which emphasizes the party-oriented attitudes that dominate the college years for many students. This situation seems less focused on the Oedipus complex, where the protagonist would be experiencing feelings of rivalry and desire for possession of a female figure.\n\nIn this scenario, it appears that the protagonist's behavior is driven more by immediate pleasure, lust, and social pressure to engage in a fun and exciting activity.

This option is not very compelling.\n\n(B) evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli\nEvolutionary selection could have favored various traits in different species, but this doesn't specifically explain why there would be more males with paraphilias.\n\n(C) of left brain/right brain differences between the genders\nThe left brain/right brain differences don't directly relate to paraphilias or gender distribution in such disorders. This option is not strongly correlated with the given belief.\n\n(D) male brains are better developed than are female brains\nThere is no scientific basis to suggest that male brains are better developed than female brains on average. This option is also not compelling.\n\nBased on the analysis, none of the options A, B, C, or D provides a clear and strong explanation for the belief that there are more males than females with paraphilias. However, option B could be considered the closest, since paraphilias might be related to evolutionary adaptations, and male brains could have developed certain traits in response to sexual stimuli that might be connected to such paraphilias.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n(B) evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli",

However, looking at the list of choices, both (B) felt fear and (D) experienced regret seem like the most likely emotions to be associated with the first act of intercourse. Consequently, it is impossible to single out one answer from these two options.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n(B) felt fear or (D) experienced regret",
