The formula for the area of a rectangle is A = W \u00d7 L, and we're given that the length is twice the width: L = 2W.\n\nStep 2: Express the diagonal of the rectangle in terms of the width.\nThe length of the diagonal (d) of a rectangle with sides of length W and L can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: d\u00b2 = W\u00b2 + L\u00b2 or d\u00b2 = (W + L)\u00b2, so d\u00b2 = (W + L)\u00b2 = 5(W\u00b2 + W\u00b2) = 5W\u00b2. Therefore, d = \u221a5 \u00d7 W.\n\nStep 3: Substitute the value of d into the area formula and solve for W.\nWe are given that the length of the diagonal (d) is $5\u221a{5}$. So, d\u00b2 = 5(\u221a5)\u00b2, which means d\u00b2 = 25\u221a(5\u00b2)\u00b2 = 25\u221a(25)\u00b2, and d = \u221a(25\u221a(25)) \u2248 5.34.\nNow, substituting this back into the formula for the diagonal, d\u00b2 = (W + L)\u00b2, gives us: 5\u00b3\uff085W\u00b2) = 5(W\u00b2 + W\u00b2) = 5W\u00b2 + 5L\u00b2, and rearranging for L: L\u00b2 = 5W\u00b2 + W\u00b2, which gives us L = (\u221a5 \u00d7 W\u00b2 + W\u00b2).\n\nStep 4: Rearrange the expression for L and solve for W.\nL = (\u221a5 \u00d7 W\u00b2 + W\u00b2), so L\u00b2 = 5W\u00b2 + W\u00b2, which gives us L = (\u221a5 \u00d7 W\u00b2 + W\u00b2). Now, rearranging that equation, we get W = \u221a((5 + 1) \u00d7 L\u00b2). Therefore, W \u2248 2.22.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the area of the rectangle.\nNow plug the approximate values of W and L into the area formula: A = W \u00d7 L = 2.22 \u00d7 5.34 \u2248 11.98.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the options (A) 2500, (B) 2, (C) 50, (D) 25 match the calculated answer approximately.

The differences between these consecutive even integers are:\n\n2 - 4: 2\n4 - 6: 2\n6 - 8: 2\n8 - 10: 2\n10 - 12: 2\n12 - 14: 2\n14 - 16: 2\n16 - 18: 2\n18 - 20: 2\n20 - 22: 2\n22 - 24: 2\n24 - 26: 2\n26 - 28: 2\n28 - 30: 2\n30 - 32: 2\n32 - 34: 2\n34 - 36: 2\n36 - 38: 2\n38 - 40: 2\n40 - 42: 2\n42 - 44: 2\n44 - 46: 2\n46 - 48: 2\n48 - 50: 2\n50 - 52: 2\n52 - 54: 2\n54 - 56: 2\n56 - 58: 2\n58 - 60: 2\n60 - 62: 2\n62 - 64: 2\n64 - 66: 2\n66 - 68: 2\n68 - 70: 2\n70 - 72: 2\n72 - 74: 2\n74 - 76: 2\n76 - 78: 2\n78 - 80: 2\n80 - 82: 2\n82 - 84: 2\n84 - 86: 2\n86 - 88: 2\n88 - 90: 2\n90 - 92: 2\n92 - 94: 2\n94 - 96: 2\n96 - 98: 2\n98 - 100: 2\n100 - 102: 2\n102 - 104: 2\n104 - 106: 2\n106 - 108: 2\n108 - 110: 2\n110 - 112: 2\n112 - 114: 2\n114 - 116: 2\n116 - 118: 2\n118 - 120: 2\n120 - 122: 2\n122 - 124: 2\n124 - 126: 2\n126 - 128: 2\n128 - 130: 2\n130 - 132: 2\n132 - 134: 2\n134 - 136: 2\n136 - 138: 2\n138 - 140: 2\n140 - 142: 2\n142 - 144: 2\n144 - 146: 2\n146 - 148: 2\n148 - 150: 2\n150 - 152: 2\n152 - 154: 2\n154 - 156: 2\n156 - 158: 2\n158 - 160: 2\n160 - 162: 2\n162 - 164: 2\n164 - 166: 2\n166 - 168: 2\n168 - 170: 2\n170 - 172: 2\n172 - 174: 2\n174 - 176: 2\n176 - 178: 2\n178 - 180: 2\n180 - 182: 2\n182 - 184: 2\n184 - 186: 2\n186 - 188: 2\n188 - 190: 2\n190 - 192: 2\n192 - 194: 2\n194 - 196: 2\n196 - 198: 2\n198 - 200: 2\n200 - 202: 2\n202 - 204: 2\n204 - 206: 2\n206 - 208: 2\n208 - 210: 2\n210 - 212: 2\n212 - 214: 2\n214 - 216: 2\n216 - 218: 2\n218 - 220: 2\n220 - 222: 2\n222 - 224: 2\n224 - 226: 2\n226 - 228: 2\n228 - 230: 2\n230 - 232: 2\n232 - 234: 2\n234 - 236: 2\n236 - 238: 2\n238 - 240: 2\n\nStep 4: Exclude the even and odd differences that result in 240. Let's exclude the differences from 2 to 64 and 126 to 198.\n\nStep 5: Identify the remaining differences that make 240.\n\nThe remaining differences that result in 240 are: 8 to 17, 44 to 58, 98 to 124, and 144 to 156.\n\nStep 6: Count the number of combinations that sum to 240.\n\nThere are 4 different odd integers that result in 240 when their differences are combined: 8, 19, 38, and 57.\n\nHowever, as none of the answer options refers to 4, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let me try again.\n\nStep",
