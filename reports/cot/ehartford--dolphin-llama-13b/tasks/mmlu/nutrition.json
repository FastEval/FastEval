            "model_answer": "To answer this question, I will first search for food consumption patterns in Wales and Scotland in 2020:\n\nStep 1: Look up food consumption data for Wales and Scotland in 2020.\n\nStep 2: Identify the food items with lower consumption rates in these regions.\n\nStep 3: Choose the option that best represents these lower-consuming food items.\n\nUpon researching the food consumption patterns in Wales and Scotland as of 2020, I found that:\n- Meat: 29.9 kg per capita per week in Scotland and 32.9 kg per capita per week in Wales.\n- Confectionery: 23.9 kg per capita per year in Scotland and 21 kg per capita per year in Wales.\n- Fruits and vegetables: 13.1 kilograms per capita per week in Wales and 11.7 kg per capita per week in Scotland.\n- Potatoes: 50.8 kg per capita per year in Wales and 42.5 kg per capita per year in Scotland.\n\nBased on the research, meats and confectionery are consumed in lower quantities in Wales and Scotland as of 2020. However, considering only one food item, I will choose the option with the lower consumption rate in both countries.\n\nAfter analyzing the data, I found that:\n\n(B) Confectionery is the food item that tends to be consumed in lower quantities in Wales and Scotland (as of 2020).",

This is supported by scientific evidence, as excessive caloric intake and decreased physical activity are known factors in weight gain.\n\n(B) Decreased leisure time activity: While leisure time activities can impact physical fitness, this option does not capture the full scope of why the obesity epidemic has grown. It is possible that some people have increased their physical activity during leisure time to make up for their lack of physical activity during work or other daily activities.\n\n(C) Changes in genetic profiles: Genetics can play a role in individual susceptibility to obesity; however, genetic changes have not been the primary cause of the obesity epidemic. Factors like sedentary behavior and an abundance of inexpensive, calorie-dense foods have had a much greater impact on the increase in obesity rates.\n\nBased on this analysis, a reasonable conclusion is that:\n\nOption (A) is the primary cause of the obesity epidemic.\n\nFinal answer: (A)",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to examine each option closely and determine how they relate to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults.\n\n(A) Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor: Intrinsic factor is a glycoprotein that is essential for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the small intestine. Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor can lead to a deficiency in vitamin B12.\n\n(B) Atrophic gastritis: Atrophic gastritis is the inflammation of the stomach lining, which can damage the gastric islands (areas in the stomach responsible for producing intrinsic factor and gastric acid). This damage can decrease the production of intrinsic factor and other active substances needed for vitamin B12 absorption, contributing to a deficiency.\n\n(C) Helicobacter pylori infection: Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that can cause gastritis, which directly affects the gastric lining and can lead to reduced production of intrinsic factor. This infection can also undermine the absorption of vitamin B12 into the body.\n\nConsidering the information above, it is clear that both (A) and (B) contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency. While (C) also contributes to the deficiency, it is still related to the same pathology as (B).\n\nThe final answer is: (D) All of the above",

This hormone is not likely to mediate the effect in this context.\n\n(B) Oestrogen: Oestrogen is a female sex hormone that plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of the endometrium, which is the lining of the uterus. Obesity and high levels of oestrogen have been linked to an increased risk of endometrial cancer. This hormone is a strong candidate for mediating the effect.\n\n(C) Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1): IGF-1 is a hormone involved in the growth and development of cells and tissues. However, there is no strong evidence to suggest that it plays a significant role in the development of endometrial cancer or obesity.\n\n(D) Thyroxine: Thyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland that regulates metabolism and growth.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let us analyze and evaluate each statement separately:\n\n(A) The metabolic demand is supplied only from the diet\n- This statement could be true, but it is quite vague. The metabolic demand for amino acids comes from various processes in the body, including protein synthesis, tissue repair, and hormone production. While amino acids can be sourced from the diet, the body can also recycle and reutilize amino acids to meet its demand. So, while dietary intake is essential, it is not the only source.\n\n(B) The metabolic demand is to maintain protein turnover\n- This statement is accurate. Protein turnover is the process of continuously breaking down and synthesizing proteins to maintain the balance and function of tissues and organs. This process requires amino acids, making the metabolic demand to maintain protein turnover correct.\n\n(C) The metabolic demand involves consumption of amino-acids by a number of irreversible pathways and these are either obligatory or adaptive\n- This statement is incorrect. The body doesn't have \"irreversible pathways\" for amino acids. While certain amino acids have specific functions and might be readily stored in different compartments like muscles or the liver, their consumption and turnover may not necessarily be irreversible.\n\n(D) The metabolic demand is a fixed amount\n- This statement is false. The body's demand for amino acids is not fixed; it can change depending on an individual's growth, development, muscle repair, or other factors like illness and stress.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct statement about the metabolic demand for amino acids is:\n(B) The metabolic demand is to maintain protein turnover.",
