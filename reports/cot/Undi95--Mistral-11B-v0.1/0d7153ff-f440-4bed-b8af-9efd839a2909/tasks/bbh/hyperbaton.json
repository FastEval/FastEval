Adjectives that describe color come first.\n2. Adjectives that describe material come second.\n3. Adjectives that describe other qualities come third.\n4. Adjectives that describe size come fourth.\n5. Adjectives that describe shape come fifth.\n6. Adjectives that describe function come sixth.\n7. Adjectives that describe purpose come seventh.\n\nIn this sentence, the adjectives \"red\", \"rubber\", and \"repulsive\" describe color, material, and quality, respectively. Therefore, they should come first, second, and third in the order.\n\nThe adjectives \"new\", \"rectangular\", and \"large\" describe size, shape, and function, respectively. Therefore, they should come fourth, fifth, and sixth in the order.\n\nThe adjective \"whittling\" describes purpose, so it should come seventh in the order.\n\nFinally, the adjective \"sweater\" is a noun that describes the type of object being described, so it should come last in the order.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of the adjectives in the sentence is:\n\n1. red\n2. rubber\n3. repulsive\n4. new\n5. rectangular\n6. large\n7. whittling\n8. sweater\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n(B) red rubber repulsive new rectangular whittling large sweater\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe correct order of the adjectives in the sentence is determined by the rules of adjective order. The first rule is that adjectives that describe color come first. In this sentence, the adjective \"red\" describes the color of the sweater, so it should come first.\n\nThe second rule is that adjectives that describe material come second. In this sentence, the adjective \"rubber\" describes the material of the sweater, so it should come second.\n\nThe third rule is that adjectives that describe other qualities come third. In this sentence, the adjective \"repulsive\" describes the quality of the sweater, so it should come third.\n\nThe fourth rule is that adjectives that describe size come fourth. In this sentence, the adjective \"new\" describes the size of the sweater, so it should come fourth.\n\nThe fifth rule is that adjectives that describe shape come fifth. In this sentence, the adjective \"rectangular\" describes the shape of the sweater, so it should come fifth.\n\nThe sixth rule is that adjectives that describe function come sixth. In this sentence, the adjective \"whittling\" describes the function of the sweater, so it should come sixth.\n\nThe seventh rule is that adjectives that describe purpose come seventh. In this sentence, the adjective \"large\" does not describe the purpose of the sweater, so it should come sixth.\n\nFinally, the eighth rule is that the noun that describes the type of object being described should come last. In this sentence, the noun \"sweater\" describes the type of object being described, so it should come last.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of the adjectives in the sentence is:\n\n1. red\n2. rubber\n3. repulsive\n4. new\n5. rectangular\n6. whittling\n7. large\n8. sweater\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n(B) red rubber repulsive new rectangular whittling large sweater",
