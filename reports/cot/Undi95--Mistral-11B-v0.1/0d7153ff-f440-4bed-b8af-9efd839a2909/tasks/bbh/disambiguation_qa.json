The antecedent of the pronoun is the noun \"cook\" that precedes it in the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIn this sentence, the pronoun \"him\" is used to refer to the person who is being asked for feedback. The noun \"cook\" is the only other person mentioned in the sentence, so it is the most likely candidate for the antecedent of the pronoun.\n\nTo determine whether the pronoun is referring to the cook or the designer, we need to consider the context of the sentence. In this case, the designer is the one who is showing the blueprint to the cook, and then asking for feedback. Therefore, it makes sense that the pronoun \"him\" is referring to the cook, rather than the designer.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (B), as the pronoun \"him\" refers to the cook, and the antecedent of the pronoun is the noun \"cook\".",

In this case, the pronoun \"she\" refers to the person who is ill, which is the patient.\n\nThe sentence begins by stating that \"The practitioner made a house call for the patient\". This implies that the practitioner is the person who is making the house call, and the patient is the person who is being visited.\n\nThe sentence then continues by explaining why the practitioner made the house call.

This interpretation would make sense if the practitioner was feeling ill and needed to make a house call to the patient.\n\n2.

This interpretation would make sense if the patient was feeling ill and needed to be visited by the practitioner.\n\nIn both interpretations, the sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in the context of the sentence.
