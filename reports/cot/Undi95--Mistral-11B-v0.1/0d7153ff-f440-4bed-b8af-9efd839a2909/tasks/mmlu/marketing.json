            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "1. First, we need to understand the concept of pricing strategies. Pricing strategies are the methods used by companies to set the price of their products or services.\n\n2. Next, we need to understand the different types of pricing strategies. There are four main types of pricing strategies:\n\n    - Premium pricing: This strategy involves setting a high price for a product or service to create a perception of quality and exclusivity.\n    - Price skimming: This strategy involves setting a high initial price for a new product or service and then gradually lowering the price as competition enters the market.\n       - Economy pricing: This strategy involves setting a low price for a product or service to attract price-sensitive customers.\n    - Penetration pricing: This strategy involves setting a low initial price for a new product or service to gain market share and then gradually increasing the price as competition enters the market.\n\n3. Now, we need to identify the pricing strategy that is described in the question. The question states that the price is set low relative to the competition to gain market share.\n\n4.
