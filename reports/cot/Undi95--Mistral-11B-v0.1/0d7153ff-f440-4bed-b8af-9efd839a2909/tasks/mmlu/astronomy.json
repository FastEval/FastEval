            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The bolometric luminosity is the total amount of energy emitted by a celestial object per unit time. It is calculated by integrating the energy emitted by the object over all wavelengths, including both visible and invisible wavelengths.\n\nThe bolometric luminosity is often expressed in units of watts (W) or joules per second (J/s). It is a measure of the total energy output of a celestial object, and can be used to compare the energy output of different types of objects.\n\nIn conclusion, the bolometric luminosity is the total amount of energy emitted by a celestial object per unit time, integrated over all wavelengths.\n\n(D) The bolometric luminosity is the total amount of energy emitted by a celestial object per unit time, integrated over all wavelengths.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The Earth has the strongest magnetic field among the terrestrial worlds because it is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation.\n\nThe Earth's magnetic field is generated by the motion of electrically conducting fluids in its core. The core is composed of a solid inner core surrounded by a liquid outer core. The motion of the liquid outer core is driven by the differential rotation of the Earth's core and mantle, which is caused by the Earth's rotation. The Earth's rotation rate is relatively fast compared to other terrestrial worlds, which helps to generate a strong magnetic field.\n\nThe Earth's magnetic field is also strengthened by the presence of a partially molten metallic core. The metallic core is composed of iron and other elements, which are good conductors of electricity. The motion of the metallic fluids in the core generates a magnetic field that is amplified by the presence of the partially molten core.\n\nThe other terrestrial worlds, such as Mars and Venus, do not have a partially molten metallic core and therefore do not have a strong magnetic field. Mars has a solid core and a thin outer layer of rock, which does not generate a strong magnetic field. Venus has a solid core and a thick outer layer of rock, which also does not generate a strong magnetic field.\n\nIn conclusion, the Earth has the strongest magnetic field among the terrestrial worlds because it is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation.",
