The number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year can be estimated by multiplying the number of households in the United States by the average number of movies watched per household per year.\n\n2. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were approximately 128 million households in the United States in 2019.\n\n3. According to a survey conducted by the National Association of Home Video Rental Stores, the average household in the United States watched approximately 20 movies per year in 2019.\n\n4. Therefore, the number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year can be estimated by multiplying 128 million households by 20 movies per household, which yields approximately 200 million movies.\n\n5.

The task is asking us to determine which of the given options is best suited for teaching students to compare quantities.\n\n2. To answer this question, we need to consider the different options provided and how they can be used to teach students about comparing quantities.\n\n3. Option A, \"Having students count all the apples in the basket,\" is not the best option for teaching students to compare quantities. While counting the apples can help students develop their counting skills, it does not directly address the concept of comparing quantities.\n\n4. Option B, \"Having students put one apple in the middle of the place mat on their desks,\" is also not the best option for teaching students to compare quantities. While this task may help students develop their spatial awareness and fine motor skills, it does not directly address the concept of comparing quantities.\n\n5. Option C, \"Having students make a Venn diagram for the color of the apples,\" is also not the best option for teaching students to compare quantities. While making a Venn diagram can help students develop their visualization skills, it does not directly address the concept of comparing quantities.\n\n6. Option D, \"Having students determine whether the numbers of red and yellow apples are equal,\" is the best option for teaching students to compare quantities. This task directly addresses the concept of comparing quantities by asking students to compare the number of red and yellow apples.\n\n7. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is Option D, \"Having students determine whether the numbers of red and yellow apples are equal.\"\n\n8. The final line of the response should contain the answer as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else.
