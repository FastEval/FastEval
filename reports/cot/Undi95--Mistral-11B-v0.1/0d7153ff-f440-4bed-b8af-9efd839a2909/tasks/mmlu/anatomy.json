            "correct_answer": 1,

The diaphragm is a muscle that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. During quiet inspiration, the diaphragm contracts and the rib cage expands, which results in an increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity. This increase in volume causes a decrease in the pressure inside the thoracic cavity, which in turn causes a decrease in the pressure outside the thoracic cavity.
