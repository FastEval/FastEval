            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Al-Zawawi also said 'This sultan Musa told me that at a town called ZKRY he has a copper mine from which ingots are brought to BYTY. \"There is nothing in my kingdom, Musa said, on which a duty is levied except this crude copper which is brought in. Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P.

The passage does not explicitly mention any wars or religious conflicts, suggesting that religious conversion was not a primary motivation for trade during this period.\n\nThe passage also does not mention any specific diseases that may have spread through trade routes. However, it does mention the presence of \"pagans\" in the kingdom of Mali, suggesting that there may have been cultural and religious differences between the kingdom and other regions.\n\nThe passage does not explicitly mention any nomadic migrations or the creation of powerful empires during this period. However, it does mention the existence of a kingdom called Mali, which suggests that there were likely other kingdoms and empires in the region at the time.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, the most likely answer is (B) \"International trade connections were still being developed in the period.\"\n\n### Answer:\n\n(B)",

            "model_answer": "(A) Many Muslims inclined toward atheism in the premodern era.\n\n(B) Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims.\n\n(C) Christian missionaries were steadily winning converts among Muslim populations.\n\n(D) Muslim intellectuals were generally hostile to traditional religious practice.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe first verse is from the Qur'an, which is the holy book of Islam. It prohibits the consumption of alcohol and gambling, as well as idol worship. The second verse is from a collection of poems by Omar Khayyam, a Persian poet and mathematician who lived in the 11th century. It encourages the consumption of wine and the enjoyment of life's pleasures.\n\nBased on this comparison, it is clear that the two verses have different attitudes towards alcohol and other forms of indulgence. The Qur'anic verse is clearly opposed to such activities, while the poem encourages them. This suggests that the Muslim intellectuals of the time were not necessarily hostile to traditional religious practice, as the answer suggests.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that some Muslims may have been inclined towards atheism or other non-traditional beliefs, as suggested by the answer. This could explain why some Muslims may have been willing to ignore the prohibitions against alcohol and other forms of indulgence.\n\nIn conclusion, while the answer suggests that Muslim intellectuals were generally hostile to traditional religious practice, the evidence from the two verses does not necessarily support this conclusion. It is possible that some Muslims may have been inclined towards atheism or other non-traditional beliefs, which could explain why some Muslims may have been willing to ignore the prohibitions against alcohol and other forms of indulgence.",
