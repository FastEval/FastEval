            "model_answer": "(A) a deletion.\n\nThe common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia is a deletion. This is because the deletion of a single nucleotide can result in a frameshift mutation, which can lead to the production of a truncated protein. This truncated protein is unable to bind to the iron-containing protein, which is necessary for the production of hemoglobin. This results in the production of a defective hemoglobin molecule, which is unable to bind to oxygen and transport it to the cells. This leads to the symptoms of \u03b1-thalassaemia, such as anemia, fatigue, and other symptoms.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia is a deletion.
