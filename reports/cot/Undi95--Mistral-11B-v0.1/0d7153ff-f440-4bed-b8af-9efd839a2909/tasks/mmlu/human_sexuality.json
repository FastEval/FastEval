            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "1. The theory that uses terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour is called \"social learning theory\".\n\n2. According to social learning theory, people learn new behaviours by observing and imitating the behaviours of others. This theory suggests that exposure to erotica can influence a person's behaviour by providing them with models of sexual behaviour to imitate.\n\n3. For example, if a person is exposed to erotica that depicts sexual behaviours that they would not normally engage in, they may be more likely to imitate those behaviours in real life.\n\n4. This theory also suggests that the effects of exposure to erotica may be influenced by factors such as the context in which the erotica is consumed, the age of the person consuming it, and their previous experiences and beliefs about sexual behaviour.\n\n5. Overall, social learning theory provides a framework for understanding how exposure to erotica can influence behaviour, and suggests that factors such as modelling and imitation may play a role in this process.\n\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) social learning theory.\n\n7. The answer is (D) social learning theory.",

However, research has shown that there are some situations where this statement may be true.\n3. For example, research has shown that people tend to like others who are similar to them in terms of attitudes and beliefs.\n4. This is because people tend to feel more comfortable and familiar with others who share similar attitudes and beliefs.\n5. However, research has also shown that there are some situations where people may actually prefer to be with others who are different from them.\n6. For example, research has shown that people may prefer to be with others who are different from them in terms of physical appearance or personality traits.\n7. This may be because people may feel more unique and special when they are with others who are different from them.\n8. Overall, it seems that the folk saying \"opposites attract\" may be true in some situations, but it may not be true in all situations.\n9. Therefore, it is important to consider the specific situation and the individual's preferences when making judgments about whether or not this statement is true.\n10. Based on the information provided, it seems that the folk saying \"opposites attract\" may be true for some people, but not for all people.\n11.
