            "model_answer": "The number of allowed values of the quantum number m_l is 2.\n\nThe quantum number m_l is the projection of the orbital angular momentum onto the z-axis. The allowed values of m_l are -l, -l+1, ..., l-1, l. Since l = 2, the allowed values of m_l are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.\n\nTherefore, the number of allowed values of the quantum number m_l is 2.\n\n### Answer:\n\n(B)",

            "model_answer": "The first step is to determine the frequency of the harmonics produced by the organ pipe. The first five harmonics are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz.\n\nThe second step is to determine which harmonics will survive once the pipe is closed at one end. The harmonics that will survive are those that are multiples of the fundamental frequency of the pipe.\n\nThe fundamental frequency of the pipe is the lowest frequency that is produced by the pipe. In this case, the fundamental frequency is 50 Hz.\n\nThe harmonics that are multiples of the fundamental frequency are 100 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz.\n\nThe harmonics that are not multiples of the fundamental frequency are 50 Hz and 150 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 100 Hz and 200 Hz only.\n\n### Answer:\n\n(B) 100 Hz and 200 Hz only",
