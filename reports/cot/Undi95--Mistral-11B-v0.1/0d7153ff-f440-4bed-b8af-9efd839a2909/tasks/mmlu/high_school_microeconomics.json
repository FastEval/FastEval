            "model_answer": "1. The price of apple peelers/corers rises.\n\n    - If the price of apple peelers/corers rises, then the cost of producing apple pies will also rise. This will lead to a decrease in the demand for labor as firms will be less willing to hire workers to produce apple pies.\n\n2. Your aunt's friends gossip all day, slowing their dough-making process.\n\n    - If your aunt's friends gossip all day, then they will be less productive in their work. This will lead to a decrease in the demand for labor as firms will be less willing to hire workers who are not productive.\n\n3. There is a sale on ovens.\n\n    - If there is a sale on ovens, then the cost of producing apple pies will decrease. This will lead to an increase in the demand for labor as firms will be more willing to hire workers to produce apple pies.\n\n4. A new study reveals that apples increase your risk of cancer.\n\n    - If a new study reveals that apples increase your risk of cancer, then the demand for apple pies will decrease. This will lead to a decrease in the demand for labor as firms will be less willing to hire workers to produce apple pies.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the most likely situation that would increase the demand for labor is if there is a sale on ovens. This would lead to a decrease in the cost of producing apple pies, which would lead to an increase in the demand for labor.\n\n### Answer:\n\n(C) There is a sale on ovens.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "1. The market structures of perfect competition and monopolistic competition share the following characteristics:\n\n- Ease of entry and exit in the long run: In both perfect competition and monopolistic competition, there is free entry and exit of firms in the long run. This means that new firms can easily enter the market and existing firms can easily exit the market without facing any significant barriers.\n\n- Homogenous products: In both perfect competition and monopolistic competition, the products produced by different firms are assumed to be homogeneous. This means that the products are identical in terms of quality, features, and characteristics.\n\n- Perfectly elastic demand for the firm's product: In both perfect competition and monopolistic competition, the demand for the firm's product is assumed to be perfectly elastic. This means that the firm can sell as much or as little of its product as it wants at a fixed price, and any change in the price will not affect the quantity demanded.\n\n- Long-run positive profits: In both perfect competition and monopolistic competition, firms are assumed to earn long-run positive profits. This means that firms are able to earn a profit that is greater than the minimum profit required to stay in the market.\n\n2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A), (B), (C), and (D).\n\n3.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The elasticity of supply is typically greater when producers have fewer alternative goods to produce. This is because when producers have fewer alternative goods to produce, they are more likely to respond to price changes by increasing or decreasing their output.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe elasticity of supply is a measure of the responsiveness of supply to changes in price. It is typically measured as the percentage change in supply divided by the percentage change in price.\n\nWhen producers have fewer alternative goods to produce, they are more likely to respond to price changes by increasing or decreasing their output. This is because they have fewer options for producing other goods, and therefore they are more likely to focus on producing the goods that are most profitable at the current price.\n\nIn contrast, when producers have more alternative goods to produce, they are less likely to respond to price changes by increasing or decreasing their output. This is because they have more options for producing other goods, and therefore they are less likely to focus on producing the goods that are most profitable at the current price.\n\n### Answer:\n\n(A) producers have fewer alternative goods to produce.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A).\n\nThe Wagner Act was a landmark labor law that established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and provided workers with the right to organize and bargain collectively. It was passed in 1935 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program.\n\nThe Sherman Act was a landmark antitrust law that was passed in 1890 to prohibit agreements between businesses that restrained competition. It was the first major federal antitrust law in the United States.\n\nThe Clayton Act was a landmark antitrust law that was passed in 1914 to clarify and strengthen the Sherman Act. It prohibited certain types of anticompetitive behavior, such as price fixing and agreements to divide markets.\n\nThe Robinson-Patman Act was a landmark antitrust law that was passed in 1936 to prohibit certain types of price discrimination by businesses. It was intended to protect small businesses from being unfairly disadvantaged by larger competitors.\n\nIn conclusion, the Wagner Act was not a landmark antitrust act, but it was a landmark labor law that established the NLRB and provided workers with the right to organize and bargain collectively.",
