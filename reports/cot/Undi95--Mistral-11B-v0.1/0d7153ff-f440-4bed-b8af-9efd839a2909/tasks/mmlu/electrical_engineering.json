When a diode is reverse biased, it means that the positive terminal of the voltage source is connected to the negative terminal of the diode and the negative terminal of the voltage source is connected to the positive terminal of the diode.\n3. When a diode is reverse biased, the voltage across the diode is negative, which means that the positive terminal of the diode is at a lower potential than the negative terminal.\n4. When a diode is reverse biased, the current flow through the diode is very small or negligible.\n5. When a diode is reverse biased, it acts as an open switch, which means that it blocks the flow of current.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Off Switch.\n\n### Output:\n\n(D)",
