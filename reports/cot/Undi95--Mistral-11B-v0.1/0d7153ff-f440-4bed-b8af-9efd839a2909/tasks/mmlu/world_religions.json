            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The most authoritative Kabbalah text is the Zohar.\n\nThe Zohar is a collection of mystical interpretations of the Torah and other Jewish texts. It is considered to be one of the most important texts in Kabbalah, and is widely studied and revered by Kabbalists.\n\nThe Zohar is attributed to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, a 2nd-century Jewish mystic and scholar. However, there is debate among scholars about the authorship and origins of the text, with some arguing that it was actually written by a group of anonymous authors in the 12th or 13th century.\n\nThe Zohar is written in a highly poetic and allegorical style, and is often difficult to understand without a deep knowledge of Jewish mystical and esoteric traditions. It is divided into four main sections, known as the \"four worlds\" of the Zohar: the world of the \"sefirot\" (the ten divine attributes), the world of \"tzaddikim\" (the righteous), the world of \"tanninim\" (the angels), and the world of \"tanninim\" (the angels).\n\nThe Zohar is considered to be a key source of Kabbalistic thought and practice, and has influenced many subsequent Jewish mystical traditions. It is widely studied and interpreted by Kabbalists today, and is considered to be a central text of Jewish mysticism.\n\nIn conclusion, the Zohar is considered to be the most authoritative Kabbalah text, and is widely studied and revered by Kabbalists. It is a complex and difficult text, but is considered to be a key source of Kabbalistic thought and practice.",
