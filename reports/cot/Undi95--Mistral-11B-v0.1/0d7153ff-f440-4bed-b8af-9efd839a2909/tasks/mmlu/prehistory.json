This shift was likely due to the development of more efficient methods of producing flakes, which allowed for the production of smaller, sharper tools. Additionally, the shift may have been driven by changes in the environment or the availability of raw materials.\n\nThe answer is (A).\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe Levallois technology was a method of producing stone tools that involved the use of a core tool to produce flakes. This method was developed around 200,000 years ago and was widely used throughout the Middle and Upper Paleolithic periods. The Levallois method involved the use of a core tool to produce a series of flakes that were then shaped and modified to create a variety of tools, such as scrapers, blades, and points.\n\nThe Levallois technology involved a shift in emphasis from producing core tools to producing flakes. This shift was likely due to the development of more efficient methods of producing flakes, which allowed for the production of smaller, sharper tools.
