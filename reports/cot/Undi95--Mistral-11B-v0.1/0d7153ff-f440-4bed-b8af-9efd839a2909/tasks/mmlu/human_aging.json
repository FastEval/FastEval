            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Green.\n\nThe burial site where the body is allowed to decompose naturally without a casket is called a green cemetery. This type of cemetery is becoming increasingly popular due to its environmental benefits. Unlike traditional cemeteries, green cemeteries do not use chemicals or other materials that can harm the environment. Instead, the body is buried in a natural setting, allowing it to decompose naturally. This process helps to return nutrients to the soil and supports the growth of plants and other wildlife.\n\nIn addition to its environmental benefits, green cemeteries also offer a more natural and peaceful setting for memorials and remembrance. Unlike traditional cemeteries, which often feature rows of headstones and other markers, green cemeteries are often designed to blend seamlessly into the surrounding landscape. This creates a peaceful and serene environment for families to visit and remember their loved ones.\n\nOverall, green cemeteries offer a more environmentally friendly and natural alternative to traditional cemeteries. By choosing a green cemetery, families can honor their loved ones while also supporting the environment and preserving natural habitats for future generations.\n\n### Answer:\n\n(B) Green",
