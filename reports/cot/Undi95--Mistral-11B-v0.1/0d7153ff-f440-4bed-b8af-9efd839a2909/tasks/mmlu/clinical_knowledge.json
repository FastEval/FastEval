            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D).\n\nThe blood continues to flow through the vessels because of the elastic recoil of the arteries.\n\nThe elastic recoil of the arteries is caused by the elastic properties of the arterial walls. When the blood flows through the arteries, the walls of the arteries are stretched and compressed. This stretching and compression of the arterial walls causes the arteries to recoil back to their original shape after the blood has passed through them. This recoil of the arteries creates a pressure gradient that helps to push the blood through the vessels.\n\nThe elastic recoil of the arteries is important because it helps to maintain the blood flow through the vessels. Without the elastic recoil of the arteries, the blood would not be able to flow through the vessels as easily and the blood pressure would be lower.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer to the question is (D) because the elastic recoil of the arteries is the reason why the blood continues to flow through the vessels between contractions of the left ventricle.",
