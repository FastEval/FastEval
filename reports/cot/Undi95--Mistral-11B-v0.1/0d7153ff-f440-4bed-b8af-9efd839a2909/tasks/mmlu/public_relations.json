            "question": "Which form of communication is most effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue?\n\n(A) Interpersonal\n(B) Media\n(C) Group\n(D) Public",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "1. First, we need to define what we mean by \"predispositions\" and \"issue\".\n\n2. A predisposition is a tendency or inclination to think or act in a certain way.\n\n3. An issue is a matter or question that is being discussed or considered.\n\n4. Based on this definition, we can conclude that the most effective form of communication to form or change predispositions toward an issue is interpersonal communication.\n\n5. Interpersonal communication refers to communication between two or more individuals, typically in a face-to-face or personal context.\n\n6. This type of communication allows for more personalized and tailored messages, which can be more effective in influencing people's beliefs and attitudes.\n\n7. Additionally, interpersonal communication allows for more opportunities for dialogue and discussion, which can help to clarify misunderstandings and address concerns.\n\n8. In contrast, media communication, which refers to communication through mass media such as television, radio, and newspapers, may be less effective in forming or changing predispositions because it is more difficult to tailor messages to individual audiences and to engage in dialogue.\n\n9. Group communication, which refers to communication within a group or community, may also be less effective because it may be more difficult to reach a consensus or to address diverse perspectives.\n\n10. Finally, public communication, which refers to communication to a large audience or public, may also be less effective because it may be more difficult to tailor messages to individual audiences and to engage in dialogue.\n\n11. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that interpersonal communication is the most effective form of communication to form or change predispositions toward an issue.\n\n12. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Interpersonal.\n\n13. In conclusion, interpersonal communication is the most effective form of communication to form or change predispositions toward an issue because it allows for more personalized and tailored messages, more opportunities for dialogue and discussion, and more opportunities to address diverse perspectives.\n\n14. The answer is (A) Interpersonal.",

            "question": "According to Esman (1972), which publics help an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance?\n\n(A) Enabling\n(B) Functional\n(C) Normative\n(D) Diffused",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "1. The first step is to identify the key terms in the question. In this case, the key terms are \"publics\", \"help\", \"organization\", \"exist\", \"authority\", and \"assistance\".\n\n2. The second step is to define the terms. In this case, \"publics\" refers to groups or individuals who are affected by or have an interest in an organization's actions or policies. \"Authority\" refers to the power or right to make decisions or take action, while \"assistance\" refers to help or support provided to an organization.\n\n3. The third step is to identify the relationship between the terms. In this case, the question asks which publics help an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance. This suggests that the publics mentioned in the question are those who can provide authority or assistance to the organization.\n\n4. The fourth step is to identify the options provided in the question. In this case, the options are (A) Enabling, (B) Functional, (C) Normative, and (D) Diffused.\n\n5. The fifth step is to analyze each option and determine which one best fits the criteria provided in the question. In this case, the options are:\n\n(A) Enabling: This refers to publics who can help an organization to exist by providing resources or support that enable the organization to function effectively.\n\n(B) Functional: This refers to publics who can help an organization to exist by providing resources or support that directly contribute to the organization's goals or objectives.\n\n(C) Normative: This refers to publics who can help an organization to exist by providing support or legitimacy based on shared values or beliefs.\n\n(D) Diffused: This refers to publics who are not directly affected by or interested in an organization's actions or policies, but who may still have an indirect impact on the organization's ability to exist.\n\n6. Based on the analysis of the options, it appears that (C) Normative is the best fit for the criteria provided in the question. This option suggests that publics who can help an organization to exist by providing support or legitimacy based on shared values or beliefs are the most relevant.\n\n7. The final step is to provide the answer, which is (C) Normative.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis of the question and the options provided, it appears that (C) Normative is the best fit for the criteria provided in the question. This suggests that publics who can help an organization to exist by providing support or legitimacy based on shared values or beliefs are the most relevant.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "1. The question asks for the name of a fashion house that sued for damages to its reputation after being accused of stealing a design.\n\n2. The answer choices provided are:\n\n- Dior\n- Givenchy\n- Chanel\n- Lacroix\n\n3. To narrow down the choices, we can consider the following factors:\n\n- The fashion house should have a reputation that could be damaged by such accusations.\n- The fashion house should have been accused of stealing a design, rather than simply copying or being inspired by another designer's work.\n\n4. Based on these factors, we can eliminate some of the choices:\n\n- Dior: While Dior is a well-known and respected fashion house, there is no evidence that it has been accused of stealing a design.\n- Givenchy: Givenchy is also a well-known and respected fashion house, but there is no evidence that it has been accused of stealing a design.\n- Chanel: Chanel is a well-known and respected fashion house, but there is no evidence that it has been accused of stealing a design.\n\n5. Based on the remaining choices, we can narrow down the answer to either Lacroix or Givenchy.\n\n6. To further narrow down the choices, we can consider the following factors:\n\n- The fashion house should have a history of legal disputes or controversies related to design theft.\n- The fashion house should have a reputation for being innovative and creative, rather than simply copying other designers' work.\n\n7. Based on these factors, we can eliminate Givenchy and narrow down the answer to Lacroix.\n\n8. Given the evidence presented, the most likely answer is Lacroix.\n\n9.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "1. The first step in the planning process is to define the program. This involves identifying the goals and objectives of the program, as well as the target audience and resources needed to achieve these goals.\n\n2. Once the program has been defined, the next step is to plan how to achieve the goals and objectives. This involves developing a plan that outlines the steps that need to be taken to implement the program, as well as the resources and timeline needed to achieve the goals.\n\n3. After the plan has been developed, the next step is to take action and implement the ideas outlined in the plan. This involves executing the steps outlined in the plan and monitoring progress to ensure that the goals and objectives are being achieved.\n\n4. Finally, the program should be evaluated to determine whether the goals and objectives were achieved and to identify areas for improvement for future programs. This involves collecting data and feedback from stakeholders and using this information to make adjustments to the program as needed.\n\nBased on the above steps, the correct answer is (B) Planning the program.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the stage in the planning process where the objectives are decided upon. The answer options provided are:\n\n1. Defining the program: This refers to the initial stage of the planning process where the goals and objectives of the program are identified.\n2. Planning the program: This refers to the stage where the plan for achieving the goals and objectives is developed.\n3. Taking action and implementing ideas: This refers to the stage where the plan is executed and the ideas are put into action.\n4. Evaluation of the program: This refers to the stage where the program is evaluated to determine whether the goals and objectives were achieved.\n\nBased on the provided options, the correct answer is (B) Planning the program. This is because the planning stage is where the objectives are defined and the plan for achieving them is developed. The other stages, such as taking action and implementing ideas, and evaluation of the program, are later stages in the planning process where the objectives are already defined and the plan is already in place.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer to the question is (B) Planning the program, as this is the stage where the objectives are defined and the plan for achieving them is developed.",
