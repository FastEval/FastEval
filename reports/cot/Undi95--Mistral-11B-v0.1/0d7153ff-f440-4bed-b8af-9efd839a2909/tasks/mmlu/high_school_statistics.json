It is a range of values that contains the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. The narrower the confidence interval, the more precise the estimate of the population parameter.\n\nThe sample size and the level of confidence are two important factors that affect the width of the confidence interval.\n\nIn the given options, the narrowest confidence interval would be obtained by choosing the combination of small sample size and 99% confidence. This is because a small sample size will result in a larger sampling error, which will lead to a wider confidence interval. However, choosing a higher level of confidence (99%) will compensate for the larger sampling error by increasing the width of the confidence interval.\n\nIn contrast, choosing a large sample size and 95% confidence will result in a wider confidence interval. This is because a large sample size will result in a smaller sampling error, which will lead to a narrower confidence interval. However, choosing a lower level of confidence (95%) will result in a wider confidence interval because it will require a larger margin of error to achieve the desired level of confidence.\n\nIn conclusion, the narrowest confidence interval would be obtained by choosing the combination of small sample size and 99% confidence.\n\n### Answer:\n\n(B) Small sample size and 99% confidence",
