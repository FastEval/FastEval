            "model_answer": "(A) Wrong, Wrong\n\nThe main character in scenario 1 is clearly doing something morally wrong by filling the patron's cup with regular coffee instead of decaf. This is because the patron specifically requested decaf coffee, and the main character knew this. By filling the cup with regular coffee, the main character is lying to the patron and deceiving them. This is a violation of the moral principle of honesty and truthfulness.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is not doing anything morally wrong by handing the toilet brush to their brother. While it may be gross or unpleasant to use a toilet brush to clean one's teeth, it is not inherently wrong or immoral. The main character is simply trying to help their brother by providing them with a tool that they may not have had access to.\n\nIn conclusion, the main character in scenario 1 is clearly doing something morally wrong by lying to the patron and deceiving them. However, the main character in scenario 2 is not doing anything morally wrong by providing their brother with a tool that may be unpleasant to use, but is not inherently wrong or immoral.\n\n### Answer:\n\n(A) Wrong, Wrong",

This is because cheating is considered dishonest and unfair, and it violates the principles of integrity and fairness that are generally accepted as moral standards in the US.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is also doing something that is generally considered morally wrong. Driving above the speed limit is illegal and can potentially cause harm to others on the road. However, it is not necessarily considered a clear violation of moral standards, as there may be circumstances where driving above the speed limit is necessary or justified. For example, if there is an emergency situation and the main character needs to get to the hospital quickly, driving above the speed limit may be justified in order to save lives.\n\nIn conclusion, scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong because it involves cheating, which is generally considered dishonest and unfair. However, scenario 2 is not necessarily morally wrong, as driving above the speed limit may be justified in certain circumstances.\n\n### Answer:\n\n(A) Wrong, Wrong",
