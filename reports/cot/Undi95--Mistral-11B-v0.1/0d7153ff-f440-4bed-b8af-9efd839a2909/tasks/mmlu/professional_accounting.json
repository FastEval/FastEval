            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "1. The first step is to identify the criteria for segment disclosure. According to the guidance provided in ASC 280, a company is required to disclose information about its operating segments if:\n\n- The company's operations are organized in such a way that the information about the segments is useful in understanding the company's financial performance.\n- The company's operations are organized in such a way that the information about the segments is useful in understanding the company's financial position.\n\n2. The next step is to determine whether the information provided for each segment meets the criteria for disclosure.\n\n- Segment A: The reported revenue for segment A is $42, which is less than 10% of the total reported revenue for the company. Additionally, the reported profit for segment A is $12, which is less than 10% of the total reported profit for the company. Therefore, segment A does not meet the criteria for disclosure.\n- Segment B: The reported revenue for segment B is $121, which is more than 10% of the total reported revenue for the company. Additionally, the reported profit for segment B is $65, which is more than 10% of the total reported profit for the company. Therefore, segment B meets the criteria for disclosure.\n- Segment C: The reported revenue for segment C is $14, which is less than 10% of the total reported revenue for the company. Additionally, the reported profit for segment C is $3, which is less than 10% of the total reported profit for the company. Therefore, segment C does not meet the criteria for disclosure.\n\n3. Based on the above analysis, the only segment that meets the criteria for disclosure is segment B. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) A and C only.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe question asks for the correct answer to the following statement:\n\n\"Swift Co. has identified three operating segments that may require separate disclosure in Swift's general purpose financial statements for the year ended December 31 year 2. Information for year 2 follows: Segment (in thousands) A B C Total Reported revenue $ 42 $ 121 $ 14 $ 177 Reported profit(loss) $ 12 $ 65 $ (3) $ 74 Assets $ 470 $ 800 $ 80 $ 1350 Which of Swift's segments are required to be separately disclosed in its December 31 year 2 financial statements?\"\n\nThe correct answer is (B) A and C only.\n\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the information provided in the question and compare it to the criteria for segment disclosure outlined in ASC 280.\n\nAccording to ASC 280, a company is required to disclose information about its operating segments if:\n\n- The company's operations are organized in such a way that the information about the segments is useful in understanding the company's financial performance.\n- The company's operations are organized in such a way that the information about the segments is useful in understanding the company's financial position.\n\nTo determine whether the information provided for each segment meets the criteria for disclosure, we need to analyze the reported revenue, profit, and assets for each segment.\n\n- Segment A: The reported revenue for segment A is $42, which is less than 10% of the total reported revenue for the company. Additionally, the reported profit for segment A is $12, which is less than 10% of the total reported profit for the company. Therefore, segment A does not meet the criteria for disclosure.\n- Segment B: The reported revenue for segment B is $121, which is more than 10% of the total reported revenue for the company. Additionally, the reported profit for segment B is $65, which is more than 10% of the total reported profit for the company. Therefore, segment B meets the criteria for disclosure.\n- Segment C: The reported revenue for segment C is $14, which is less than 10% of the total reported revenue for the company. Additionally, the reported profit for segment C is $3, which is less than 10% of the total reported profit for the company. Therefore, segment C does not meet the criteria for disclosure.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the only segment that meets the criteria for disclosure is segment B. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) A and C only.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer to the question is (B) A and C only. The information provided for segment B meets the criteria for disclosure, while the information provided for segments A and C does not meet the criteria for disclosure. Therefore, only segment B is required to be separately disclosed in Swift's general purpose financial statements for the year ended December 31 year 2.",
