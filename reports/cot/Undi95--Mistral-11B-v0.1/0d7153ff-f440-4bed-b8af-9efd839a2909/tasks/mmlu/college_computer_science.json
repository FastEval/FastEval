If the condition is not met, the instruction will not be executed. This can lead to a pipeline stall if the instruction following the conditional branch is dependent on the outcome of the conditional branch.\n\n(B) Variable-length encoding of instructions\n\nVariable-length encoding of instructions can lead to a pipeline stall if the instruction length is not known beforehand. This can cause the pipeline to be stalled while waiting for the instruction length to be determined.\n\n(C) Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute\n\nInstructions that require different numbers of cycles to execute can lead to a pipeline stall if the instruction following the instruction requiring a different number of cycles is dependent on the outcome of the instruction.\n\n(D) Several different classes (sets) of registers\n\nSeveral different classes of registers can lead to a pipeline stall if the instruction following the instruction that uses a different class of register is dependent on the outcome of the instruction.\n\n### Answer:\n\n(D) Several different classes (sets) of registers",

For the first policy, Round-robin, each job is given a fixed amount of time to execute, and then the scheduler moves on to the next job in the queue. This policy ensures that each job gets a fair share of the CPU time, but it does not guarantee that a job will not wait indefinitely for service. Therefore, Round-robin is not a starvation-free policy.\n\n4. For the second policy, Priority queuing, jobs are scheduled based on their priority. Jobs with higher priority are scheduled first, and jobs with lower priority are scheduled later. This policy ensures that jobs with higher priority are scheduled first, but it does not guarantee that a job with lower priority will not wait indefinitely for service. Therefore, Priority queuing is not a starvation-free policy.\n\n5. For the third policy, Shortest job first, jobs are scheduled based on their execution time.
