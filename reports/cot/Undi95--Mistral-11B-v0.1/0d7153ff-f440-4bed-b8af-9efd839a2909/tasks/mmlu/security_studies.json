            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A).\n\nThe postcolonial approach argues that the international system is shaped by the discourse of colonialism, which establishes certain states as inferior to others. This discourse is based on the idea that some states are more advanced and civilized than others, and that these states have the right to dominate and control the \"lesser\" states. This discourse is reflected in the unequal distribution of power and resources in the international system, which favors the interests of the dominant states and perpetuates the inequality and exploitation of the \"lesser\" states.\n\nThe postcolonial approach also challenges the notion that European practices of free trade and democracy are the best way to create a peaceful and stable international system. It argues that these practices are based on the assumption of Western superiority and are used to justify the domination and exploitation of other states. Instead, the postcolonial approach advocates for a more equal and democratic international system that recognizes the rights and interests of all states, regardless of their historical or political context.\n\nThe postcolonial approach also rejects the idea that the end of the Second World War and the dissolution of the British Empire have rendered it irrelevant. While these events may have marked a shift in the balance of power in the international system, the legacy of colonialism continues to shape the relationships and dynamics between states. The postcolonial approach argues that the legacy of colonialism continues to manifest itself in the unequal distribution of power and resources, the perpetuation of inequality and exploitation, and the continued dominance of certain states over others.\n\nFinally, the postcolonial approach rejects the idea that colonial power is solely based on military force. While military force may be used to maintain colonial control, it is only one aspect of the broader system of power and domination that underpins colonialism. The postcolonial approach argues that colonial power is also based on ideological and cultural dominance, which is reflected in the ways in which colonial discourse shapes the perceptions and understandings of the world.\n\nIn conclusion, the postcolonial approach argues that the international system is shaped by the discourse of colonialism, which establishes certain states as inferior to others. It challenges the notion that European practices of free trade and democracy are the best way to create a peaceful and stable international system, and rejects the idea that the end of the Second World War and the dissolution of the British Empire have rendered it irrelevant. It also argues that colonial power is based on more than just military force, but also on ideological and cultural dominance.",
