            "model_answer": "The phrase \"empire by invitation\" refers to a situation where a country or region voluntarily accepts the influence or control of another more powerful country or empire. This implies a willingness on the part of the inviting country or region to accept the presence and influence of the invading power, rather than resistance or opposition.\n\nIn the context of colonialism, \"empire by invitation\" could refer to situations where local leaders or elites in a region were willing to accept the presence and influence of a more powerful empire, often in exchange for economic or political benefits. This could include situations where local leaders were willing to accept the presence of colonial administrators or officials, or to participate in economic arrangements that benefited the empire but also provided some benefits to the local population.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that \"empire by invitation\" does not necessarily imply consent or genuine willingness on the part of the inviting country or region. In many cases, local leaders may have been coerced or manipulated into accepting the presence of the empire, or may have been motivated by self-interest rather than genuine support for the empire's goals.\n\nIn conclusion, \"empire by invitation\" refers to situations where a country or region voluntarily accepts the influence or control of another more powerful empire, often in exchange for economic or political benefits. However, it is important to recognize that this may not always reflect genuine consent or support for the empire's goals.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (D).\n\nThe answer is (D) because:\n\n1. Reciprocity across multiple issues: This mechanism involves countries agreeing to lower tariffs or other trade barriers in exchange for similar concessions from other countries. This creates a mutually beneficial situation where all countries involved benefit from increased trade and economic cooperation.\n\n2. Reputational concerns of the actors: Countries are also motivated to participate in international trade agreements because of the reputational benefits that come with being a member of a global trade organization. This helps to build trust and credibility among other countries, which can lead to further economic cooperation and benefits.\n\n3. Side payments for adjusting to the organization: In some cases, countries may need to make adjustments to their domestic policies or regulations to comply with the requirements of a trade agreement. This can involve financial or other types of support from other countries to help them adjust to the new rules.\n\nIn conclusion, international trade agreements work by using a combination of reciprocity across multiple issues, reputational concerns of the actors, and side payments for adjusting to the organization. This creates a mutually beneficial situation where all countries involved benefit from increased trade and economic cooperation.",
