            "model_answer": "The galvanometer is a device that is used to measure the electric current. It is a type of electromagnetic device that uses the principle of electromagnetic induction to measure the electric current. The galvanometer consists of a coil of wire that is placed in a magnetic field. When a current is passed through the coil, it produces a magnetic field that is perpendicular to the magnetic field of the galvanometer. The magnetic field produced by the coil is proportional to the current flowing through it. The galvanometer can be calibrated to read the electric current by adjusting the magnetic field of the galvanometer to produce a certain amount of deflection in the coil.
