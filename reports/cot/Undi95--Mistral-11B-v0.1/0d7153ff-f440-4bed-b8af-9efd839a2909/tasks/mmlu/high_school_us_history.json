            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt a meeting of working girls held at Hull House during a strike in a large shoe factory, the discussions made it clear that the strikers who had been most easily frightened, and therefore the first to capitulate, were naturally those girls who were paying board and were afraid of being put out if they fell too far behind. After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nThe perspective of the passage above would most directly support which of the following political goals?\n\n(A) Women's suffrage\n(B) Trust-busting\n(C) Greater rights for unions\n(D) Weakening political machines",

            "model_answer": "The passage above is written by Jane Addams, who was a social reformer and activist. She was a prominent figure in the women's suffrage movement and was also a supporter of labor rights and unionization.\n\nThe passage describes a meeting of working girls who were striking against unfair working conditions in a shoe factory. The girls were struggling to make ends meet and were afraid of being evicted from their boarding houses if they were unable to pay their rent. This led to some of them capitulating and returning to work despite the poor conditions.\n\nThe girls discussed the idea of forming a boarding club where they could support each other financially and emotionally. They believed that by working together, they would be able to stand up against the unfair practices of their employers and demand better working conditions.\n\nThe passage also mentions that the Settlement, which was likely a social welfare organization, helped to furnish the apartments and pay the first month's rent. This suggests that the Settlement was supportive of the girls' efforts to improve their working conditions and living situations.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, it seems likely that the perspective of the passage would most directly support the goal of greater rights for unions. The girls were struggling to improve their working conditions and were willing to strike in order to demand better pay and working conditions. The formation of a boarding club would have provided them with a sense of community and support, which would have strengthened their collective bargaining power.\n\nIn conclusion, the perspective of the passage would most directly support the goal of greater rights for unions, as it emphasizes the importance of collective action and solidarity among workers in the fight for better working conditions and fair wages.\n\n### Answer:\n\n(C) Greater rights for unions\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe passage describes a meeting of working girls who were struggling to improve their working conditions and living situations.

This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills.\nAt this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy.

But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nThe policy described most immediately led to\n\n(A) peace between Indian tribes and white settlers.\n(B) the forced removal of the Cherokee from their homeland.\n(C) the first Treaty of Fort Laramie, which guaranteed Indian possession of lands west of the Mississippi River.\n(D) a negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government, by which the tribes were allowed to remain on their lands for ten years.",

The policy described most immediately led to a negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government, by which the tribes were allowed to remain on their lands for ten years.\n\nThe policy described in the question refers to the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which was passed by the U.S. Congress to remove Native American tribes from their traditional lands in the Southeast and relocate them to lands west of the Mississippi River. The act was intended to resolve the ongoing conflict between the tribes and the settlers who were encroaching on their lands.\n\nThe act led to a series of negotiations between the tribes and the U.S. government, which resulted in a negotiated settlement in 1832. Under the terms of the settlement, the tribes were allowed to remain on their lands for ten years, during which time they would be protected by the U.S. government and allowed to continue their traditional way of life.\n\nThe act also led to the forced removal of the Cherokee tribe from their homeland in the Southeast. The Cherokee had resisted the removal efforts and had even taken the case to the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the U.S. government. The Cherokee were eventually forced to relocate to lands west of the Mississippi River, where many of them died from disease and starvation.\n\nThe act also led to the first Treaty of Fort Laramie, which was signed in 1851. The treaty guaranteed Indian possession of lands west of the Mississippi River, but it did not prevent the U.S. government from later violating the treaty and encroaching on the lands of the tribes.\n\nIn conclusion, the policy described most immediately led to a negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government, by which the tribes were allowed to remain on their lands for ten years. However, the act also led to the forced removal of the Cherokee tribe and the violation of the first Treaty of Fort Laramie.",

The case involved Homer Plessy, a mixed-race man who was arrested for sitting in a \"whites-only\" section of a train. The Supreme Court ruled that state laws that segregated blacks and whites were constitutional, as long as the facilities provided for blacks were \"separate but equal\" to those provided for whites.\n\nThe decision in Plessy v.

It legitimized the system of segregation that had been in place in many parts of the country, and it was used to justify laws and policies that discriminated against blacks and other minority groups.\n\nThe decision in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) was eventually overturned by the Supreme Court in the case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas (1954).
