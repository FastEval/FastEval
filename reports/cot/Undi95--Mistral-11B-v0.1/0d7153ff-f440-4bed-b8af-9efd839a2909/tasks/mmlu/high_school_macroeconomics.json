            "model_answer": "The crowding-out effect is the result of increasing interest rates from expansionary monetary policy.\n\nThe crowding-out effect occurs when the government increases its spending or reduces its taxes, leading to an increase in the demand for goods and services. This increase in demand leads to an increase in prices, which in turn leads to an increase in interest rates.\n\nThe increase in interest rates leads to a decrease in investment and consumption, as individuals and businesses prefer to hold cash rather than invest or spend it. This decrease in investment and consumption leads to a decrease in the demand for goods and services, which in turn leads to a decrease in prices and a decrease in interest rates.\n\nThe crowding-out effect is a negative effect of expansionary monetary policy, as it leads to a decrease in investment and consumption, which in turn leads to a decrease in economic growth.\n\n### Answer:\n\n(C)",

            "model_answer": "1. Mary is unemployed because she quit her job to look for another.\n2. John is not unemployed because he retired from work at age 45.\n3. Diane is not unemployed because she works part-time but would like to work full-time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) I only.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe question asks which of the given persons is considered to be unemployed. The options provided are:\n\n1. Mary who has quit her job to look for another.\n2. John who fulfilled his dream by retiring from work at age 45.\n3. Diane who works part-time but would like to work full-time.\n\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to understand the definition of unemployment. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, \"unemployed persons are those who are currently available for work, actively seeking work, and have not worked for pay or profit in the past week.\"\n\nBased on this definition, we can eliminate option (B) because John retired from work at age 45, which means he is not actively seeking work. Similarly, option (C) can be eliminated because Diane is working part-time, which means she is not actively seeking work.\n\nTherefore, the only option that meets the definition of unemployment is option (A), which states that Mary has quit her job to look for another. This means that she is actively seeking work and is not currently employed, making her unemployed according to the definition provided.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer to the question is (A) I only.",
