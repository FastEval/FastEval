            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited\n\nThe answer is (A) because individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited.\n\nThe first sentence of the question asks whether individuals enjoy international legal personality. The answer is yes, because individuals are recognized as legal persons under international law. However, the second sentence of the question clarifies that this international legal personality is limited. This means that individuals do not have the same rights and obligations as States or international organizations.\n\nFor example, individuals cannot bring claims against States or international organizations in international courts. They also do not have the right to participate in international negotiations or agreements.\n\nIn conclusion, individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited. They do not have the same rights and obligations as States or international organizations.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe question asks whether individuals enjoy international legal personality in the same manner as States and international organizations. The answer is that individuals do not enjoy international legal personality in the same manner as States and international organizations.\n\nIndividuals are not recognized as legal persons under international law, and therefore do not have the same rights and obligations as States or international organizations. For example, individuals cannot bring claims against States or international organizations in international courts, and they do not have the right to participate in international negotiations or agreements.\n\nIn conclusion, individuals do not enjoy international legal personality in the same manner as States and international organizations.",

This means that international law takes precedence over domestic laws in cases where there is a conflict between the two.\n\nIn a monist system, international law is considered to be the supreme law of the land, and domestic laws must conform to it. This means that if there is a conflict between international law and domestic law, the international law will prevail.\n\nIn contrast, in a dualist system, international law is considered to be separate and distinct from domestic law. In this system, international law is not automatically incorporated into domestic law, and domestic laws are not automatically considered to be in conflict with international law. Instead, the two systems operate independently of each other, and there is no automatic hierarchy between them.\n\nIn conclusion, the fundamental premise of monist theory is that international law is superior to domestic laws.

            "model_answer": "The doctrine of incorporation suggests that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law.\n\nThe doctrine of incorporation is a principle of international law that states that treaties that have been ratified by a state automatically become part of the domestic law of that state. This means that the treaty is directly applicable in the domestic legal system of the state, without the need for further legislative action.\n\nThe doctrine of incorporation is based on the principle of the supremacy of international law over domestic law. This means that international law takes precedence over domestic law, and that treaties that have been ratified by a state must be given priority over domestic laws that conflict with them.\n\nThe doctrine of incorporation is important because it ensures that states are bound by their international obligations, even if they have not specifically incorporated the treaty into their domestic law. This means that states cannot simply ignore their obligations under a treaty, even if they have not specifically legislated to implement it.\n\nThe doctrine of incorporation is not universally accepted, however. Some states argue that treaties should only be incorporated into domestic law through a specific legislative process, rather than automatically becoming part of the domestic law. This view is based on the principle of the separation of powers, which states that the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government should be separate and independent.\n\nIn conclusion, the doctrine of incorporation suggests that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law. This means that the treaty is directly applicable in the domestic legal system of the state, without the need for further legislative action. However, the doctrine of incorporation is not universally accepted, and there are ongoing debates about the appropriate role of treaties in the domestic legal system.",

            "model_answer": "The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has not explicitly addressed the issue of whether an armed attack can arise through a series of lower intensity, yet cumulative, instances of armed force. However, the ICJ's decision in the Nicaragua case provides some guidance on this issue.\n\nIn the Nicaragua case, the ICJ was asked to determine whether the United States had violated the principle of the prohibition of the use of force in international law by providing support to the Contras, a rebel group in Nicaragua. The ICJ concluded that the United States had violated this principle by providing support to the Contras, including by providing military assistance and training.\n\nIn its decision, the ICJ did not explicitly address the issue of whether an armed attack can arise through a series of lower intensity, yet cumulative, instances of armed force. However, the ICJ's decision suggests that it would not be hostile to the idea that an armed attack may arise through a series of lower intensity, yet cumulative, instances of armed force.\n\nThe ICJ's decision in the Nicaragua case does not explicitly endorse the concept of an armed attack arising through a series of lower intensity, yet cumulative, instances of armed force. However, the ICJ's decision does not explicitly reject this concept either.\n\nIn conclusion, while the ICJ has not explicitly addressed the issue of whether an armed attack can arise through a series of lower intensity, yet cumulative, instances of armed force, the ICJ's decision in the Nicaragua case suggests that it would not be hostile to this idea.\n\n### Answer:\n\n(A) The ICJ was not hostile to the accumulation theory",
