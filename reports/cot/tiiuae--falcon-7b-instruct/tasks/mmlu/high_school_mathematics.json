We can not include 1, ourselves, and n in our list since p is not a factor of n ourselves or 1.\n5. Based on the above four conditions, the answer is D (dy n) instead of A or B.\nStep 1: We can take prime factors' powers to simplify the calculation, where m is the smallest prime factor of n.\n101 is the prime factor of 40, 2 is the prime factor of 4, and 1 is the factor of 1. Therefore, 2^4 is 16, 2^2 is 4, and 1 is not a factor of 40 or 4, so it can not be the powerful number A or B.\n\nStep 2: We can use the fourth condition for not including 1, ourselves, and n in our list since p is not a factor of n or 1.\n4 is not a factor of n, so it can not be the powerful number A or B.\n\nStep 3: We can now use the fifth condition which states that p is not a factor of n itself ourselves or 1. If it itself or 1 is not a factor, then it can not be the powerful number A or B.\n\nFrom the above reasoning, we can see that n = 300 is a powerful number because for not including 1, ourselves, and n, p equals itself (12) and is not a factor of n ourselves or 1, and equals itself also for n = 100 (12) and is not a factor of n ourselves or 1.
