A thin layer of oil would bend this light, resulting in the light being deflected from its original direction. The index of refraction of oil is 1.5, making it bend the light more, returning it to water's direction. Based on this reasoning, the answer is C) 600 nm.",

A reversible process is one in which the entropy of the system and its environment remain constant during the process.\n\n2. No new energy or thermal quantities are being added or removed from the system, so the internal energy of the system remains constant.\n\n3. The only possible changes happening during the process are those related to the system's components, and these will not affect the internal energy of the system or change the entropy of its environment.\n\n4. The definition of entropy being constant during the process is directly applicable to any reversible thermodynamic process.\n\nTherefore, any reversible thermodynamic process is a true statement based on the answer given.",

While different sources might give A, B, C or D as the correct answer, they will all show a very small difference in the final answer. Given we only need to generalize this little difference to get the answer, we should easiest go from A to D. Step by step reasoning: (1) mp=(m)(1/2) = (counter little different) mg. (2) mg is so small, e.g. m^(-100), that we can calculate =(d) mg from both (the generalization rule) and (1) mp=(d) mg from both.
