            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Delusions of grandeur are typically associated with either obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia, or conversion disorder. Antisocial personality disorder (APD) is a notable exception. OCD is thought to involve multiple personality states or different aspects of personality, which leads to grandiose delusions. Symptoms of thought intrusion are present in OCD; delusions of grandeur are not. In schizophrenia, symptoms of disorganized thinking are present, but grandiose delusions are not part of the diagnostic criteria. Conversion disorder would be more compatible with a fear of losing one's mind or episodes of dissociation, but grandiose delusions are not part of that diagnosis either. Finally, antisocial personality disorder would be more compatible with a fear of losing one's mind or episodes of dissociation, but grandiose delusions are not part of that diagnosis either. Therefore, only APD is applicable for grandiose delusions.",

            "question": "Abraham Maslow proposed the idea that some motives are more imperative to survival than others. Which of the following approaches expresses this?\n\n(A) Homeostatic regulation\n(B) Goal-setting\n(C) Expectancy-value\n(D) Hierarchy of needs",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Please choose the letter B - Goal-setting. The reasoning behind this choice is that Maslow believed that the most immediate and important goal of human beings is self-actualisation, which is also referred to as the 'hierarchy of needs'. Maslow believed that everyone, regardless of their social status or income, has the need to self-actualise. Therefore, by choosing self-actualisation as the goal of survival, while also explaining it in a phase-by-phase manner, helps to capture what Maslow meant. The final step ('the most immediate and important goal of human beings is self-actualisation') is directly quoted from Maslow himself.",

            "question": "In test construction and evaluation, validity refers to the degree to which a test\n\n(A) measures what it purports to measure\n(B) yields consistent results on successive administrations\n(C) has been piloted and statistically analyzed\n(D) includes norms based on a representative sample of the general population",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "A) Constructing a valid test is a key component for its successful administration and interpretation. The purpose of the test must be clear, and must be based on good, sound theory. The test must also be administered consistently to all those being tested, as well as being calibrated to accurately measure the construct it is designed to capture. Standard procedures must be in place for processing the test results as well.  Results must also be considered in relation to the test items' difficulty level, their contribution to the purpose of the test, and must be helpful and relevant to those who will be adjudicating the test results - such as in instructional settings. Due to the effectiveness of validity in a variety of settings - such as job selection - it is sometimes referred to as a screen tool. B) To be a valid measure, a test must be free of any personal bias or subjective factors - such as cultural bias - and must consistently yield the same results. Furthermore, in the context of the test, goals of the test should be clearly expressed - such as sorting of items in a worksheet. C) The purpose of norms based on a representative sample is important for validity. When a test is being used to administer norms to a specific population, it would be better to be systematic in collecting that information and administration.  With this in mind, validity of the norms, the test item characteristics, the test feedback, as well as the norms calculation should be considered. D) Bias-free sampling of the population and a piloting effectiveness of the test for various populations through generational studies to check the reliability of the instrument - effectiveness of the tool for various populations through generational studies to check the reliability of the instrument - and other alternative norms calculation methods.

            "question": "The precedent established in Larry P. v. Riles resulted in\n\n(A) the provision of a free, appropriate public education for students with disabilities\n(B) the provision of bilingual education for English-language learners\n(C) schools being held responsible for providing tests that do not discriminate on the basis of race\n(D) the assignment of similar funding to athletic activities for boys and girls",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "In Larry P. v. Riles, the case established a precedent that pertains to students with disabilities. Pivotal to the case was the 5th Amendment, where it was determined that students should not be forced to waive their right to a free, appropriate public education or their right to engage in extracurricular activities without a court ruling that the activity was substantially related to a legitimate public purpose. In step B, the reasoning is that providing a bilingual education to English-language learners would be seen as benefitting them as well as their peers, substantially related to a legitimate public purpose. In step C, the reasoning is that requiring schools to provide tests that do not discriminate on the basis of race ensures that students of all racial backgrounds are tested equally and can grasp material effectively. In step D, the reasoning is that the plaintiff, in this case, requested for funding to go to sports activities for boys and girls, conditioning a court to ensure this type of payment would be seen as benefitting the school and directly benefitting each individual student in a legitimate public purpose. In conclusion, the correct reasoning is option B, as it is a direct application of the Supreme Court's ruling in the Larry P. v. Riles case.",

Ainsworth, on the other hand, has built a theory in which attachment relationships with primary caregivers throughout each developmental stage, including infancy, significantly influence basic personality traits and the likelihood of developing attachment disorders. Ainsworth suggests that attachment relationships are the primary factor in determining basic emotions, perspective-taking skills, conscience, and the capacity for interpersonal relationships and a \"secure attachment\" is the foundation of a well-functioning adult personality. \n\nIn summary, Ainsworth's social attachment theory explains how experiences in infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood influence essential personality traits and is not concerned with the finer, cognitive aspects of development.",
