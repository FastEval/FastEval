            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Please check your response.\n\nExplanation: The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea applies to quite a few matters relating to marine affairs, but the retainers or law governing jurisdiction over on-board crimes appears to be that of the flag State; that is, the State that registered or owns the vessel in question. \n\nIn order to exercise sovereignty properly over offences committed on its territory in upon the ocean (CQPC), the sovereignty of the flag State applies. This underlying sovereignty also means that the more the State is bound to properly handle offences under Its own territory in upon the ocean (CQPC), the sovereignty of the flag State applies. Therefore, upon the ocean (CQPC) within a State's jurisdiction, the sovereignty of the flag State applies. This underlying sovereignty also means that the more the State is bound to properly handle offences under Its own territory in upon the ocean (CQPC), the sovereignty of the flag State applies. Therefore, retainers or law governing jurisdiction over on-board crimes appears to be that of the flag State; that is, the State that registered or owns the vessel in question.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer to the circled question is (B). The reasoning stepwise: \n- R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress. This means it applies on a case-by-case basis, while humanitarian intervention can be applied to a broader range of situations with an intent to provide aid or assistance. \n- R2P can include armed force, while humanitarian intervention generally does not. This is because the latter involves non-military means of providing aid, such as providing refugees with food, water, medical care or shelter, and setting up a graduated scale of protection for them.

A beach, for example, is a common example of a rock. In contrast, the vast underwater oceans and deep canyons commonly found between large islands would typically be noted as maritime zones (typically typically enclosed in a turtle enclosure), meaning they are not considered rocks. On the other hand, typically enclosed in a turtle enclosure would likely be rocks. Rocks, therefore, are the common landforms I would examine for beach and tidelands.",
