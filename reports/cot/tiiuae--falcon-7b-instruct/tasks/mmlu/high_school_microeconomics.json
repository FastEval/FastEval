The firm is currently operating at a level of capital production where the marginal product of capital is 50. \n2. If the firm continues along this path, it will profit from producing more capital. \n3. Decreasing the level of capital production while keeping labor at $1 will make the marginal product of labor rise and the marginal product of capital fall, benefiting the firm. \nTherefore, \"A\" is the best choice.",

This requires a bit of reasoning. Whenever a consumer interacts with the market, the market mechanism tends towards equilibrium at a higher price. If the market cannot reach equilibrium, the price rises beyond the consumer's expected marginal willingness to pay, forcing the consumer to give up some of his or her satisfaction in order to obtain the remaining part.(A) Existing market conditions(B) New markets or technologies(C) Doing nothing(D) Invisible hand.   \n(D) An externality exists when the market cannot reach equilibrium. This is because the market and the externality form a system, with a larger price representing the expected marginal willingness to pay from the consumer side, due to the higher equilibrium price being an outward shock that affects the market outcome. The mechanism tends towards equilibrium at higher prices due to the externality, resulting in an equilibrium price with a larger price representing the expected marginal willingness to pay from the consumer side, due to the higher equilibrium price being an outward shock that affects the market outcome.",
