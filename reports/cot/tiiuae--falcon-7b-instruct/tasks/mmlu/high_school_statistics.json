An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim.

            "model_answer": "1. the sample size (6) is large enough to reject the manufacturer's claim ( the sample standard deviation is 0.0625. )\n2. the sample mean is 299.55, which is larger than the claimed average weight of 299, so the sample data does not meet the assumptions of a normal distribution, therefore it is very unlikely that the sample mean could be lower the manufacturer's claim.\n3. PS: It is AD or E. \n the P-value of step 1 is PS(t &gt; 1.54) = 0.0126\nthe P-value of step 2 is PS(d = 6 the sample size) = 0.3273\nBased on the reasoning provided, we can conclude that the P-value of hypothesis PS(t &gt; 1.54) = 0.0126 PS(t &gt; 1.54 the sample size = 6) is PS(t &gt; 1.54). Thus, the step 1 hypothesis PS(t &gt; 1.54) should be rejected in favor of the PS(t &gt; 1.54) value.",

            "model_answer": "The waiting time for a roller coaster is normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. Since there are 150,000 riders in a normal summer, it is likely that a) 0 to 31.7 minutes is the shortest time interval. To find the range of waiting times for 100,000 riders, the formula used is RT = R * Pi / (a+1), where R is the standard deviation and a is the number of riders. Pi is approximately equal to 3.14159. Therefore, RT for 100,000 riders could be Pi / (a+1) = 130.8 minutes. Answer: B) 31.7 to 39.3 minutes.",
