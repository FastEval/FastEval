            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The Gulf of Tonkin resolution essentially served as a political response to attacks on US ships in the Gulf of Tonkin in August 1965, with a subsequent vote to allow US President Johnson to escalate military operations in Vietnam. The resolution allowed the US government to claim that it was in response to a \"ratification of aggression\" from North Vietnam. This congressional action provided legal justification for increased US involvement in the Vietnam War. The resolution passage therefore strengthens the B answer: The response to attacks on US ships in the Gulf of Tonkin allowed the US to escalate involvement in the Vietnam War.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "1. We eliminate 'organized crime' as a potential risk for two reasons. First, because organized crime primarily operates within a specific geographic area. As the national military power, the US may consider any threat from a nonstate actor restricted to its own soils.\n\n2. Next, let's consider 'terrorists'. Although they can potentially cause harm to the USA, their actions usually lack state support, and they may not have a specific national military objective. Therefore, 'terrorists' may not pose a direct threat to the US military power.\n\n3. 'Drug traffickers' immediately jump to mind, but it is important to look further. The US government can target and ultimately eradicate 'drug traffickers' through legal measures. Although they potentially cause harm to American citizens, their actions fall under the umbrella of criminal activity that the US has jurisdiction over.\n\n4. 'China' now seems like the most likely threat. China often engages in economic and political activities that can impact the US industries. However, unlike 'organized crime' or 'radical terrorist groups', China primarily respects international law, which limits the extent of their actions that potentially may harm US nationals or military objectives. \n\n5. We eliminate 'China' as a potential threat as well. By adhering to international law, China prevents its militaries actions from causing harm to US citizens.\n\nBy considering each step-by-step, the only nonstate actor that poses a threat to the US in this scenario is (D) 'China'.",
