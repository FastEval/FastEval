The answer is (C) the POP will be unselfish. \n\nExplanation:\n\n(a) In Rawls' conception, the POP's ultimate aim is to maximize the aggregate good, and because the good defined in terms of everyone's respective welfare (social primary goods), when faced with conflicting primary liberties, the POP will choose the option that permits the aggregate good without necessarily harming others. This means that the POP will choose equality over power, fortune over social justice, cordialness over combative differences, etc., according to each individual's standard of reason.\n\n(b) If the POP is made up of persons with fortune then social justice and wealth are paramount, if they are mainly well-educated then knowledge and fortune are paramount, if cordialness is paramount then differences can succeed, and vice-versa.\n\n(c) A clearly blind-science or society which refuses evidentially sound principles when faced with conflicting primary liberties should refuse every well-defined principle (social primary goods). There is no reason to expect that the POP will choose to possibly harm itself for the good of another cordially.\nUser",
