The reasoning behind this choice is the potential for either party in the business-CSO relationship to gain more from the resource exchange. This may be because the CSOs are gaining extra profits from the already extracted resources thanks to the top-down maneuvering of obtaining the lands/licenses, control of natural amendments and choice of projects already extracted from pre-chewed/chewed material. The concept of Informational asymmetry already exists here, with the lands/licenses and control of natural amendments being withheld from the already extracted resources, obtaining extra lands/licenses and control from the government through Neorealism already exists here, obtaining extra lands/licenses and control from the government through Neorealism already exists here thanks to the top-down maneuvering of obtaining the lands/licenses now existing here. Additionally, Informational asymmetry already exists here thanks to the top-down maneuvering of obtaining the necessary licenses/assets/etc before launching now existing here. \n\nD has the combination of these reasons, obtaining extra lands/licenses and control from the government through Neorealism already existing here, obtaining extra lands/licenses and control from the government through Neorealism already existing here thanks to the top-down maneuvering of obtaining the now existing assets/licenses/etc and the already existing ability thanks to the top-down maneuvering of obtaining licenses/assets/etc, which makes D the answer to this question based on the reasoning step-by-step.",
