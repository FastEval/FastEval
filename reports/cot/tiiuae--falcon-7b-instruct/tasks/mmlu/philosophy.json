            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(A) the body\n\nExplanation:\nFirstly, Socrates did not believe an unexamined life was a tragedy. Instead, he believed self-examination was vital for personal growth and development. However, when examining Socrates' actions, it is arguably true that they caused grievous harm to those around him. Socrates was a known advocate of critical thinking and self-examination, thus his actions hold a lesson for us to self-examine the consequences of our actions. If Socrates' teachings hold any truth, self-examination is vital for personal growth and development, which suggests that sometimes, the wide-reaching impact of an unexamined life can have tragic implications. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) the soul.",

Since Kant's categorical imperative is based on reason and rationality, and every concept conforms to this categorical imperative, all actions are necessarily inherently good only if they are compatible with the concept of duty, and all actions have to be inherently understood as cognitively compatible with the concept of duty, and all cognitive acts follow from concepts, and all rational cognitive acts are necessarily cognitively followed from concepts, they all relate to the fundamental cognitive concept of duty, and all actions have to be inherently understood as cognitively compatible with the concept of duty, and all cognitive acts follow from concepts, and all rational cognitive acts are necessarily cognitively followed from concepts, and so, all actions are necessarily inherently cognitively followed from concepts, and they all relate to the fundamental cognitive concept of duty, and all cognitive acts follow from concepts, and all rational cognitive acts are necessarily cognitively followed from concepts, and so, all actions are necessarily inherently cognitively followed from concepts.

Instead of focusing on the act itself, think about what makes an action good or worthwhile, from the perspective of a completely rational individual. Considering rationality, the answer is not option A, but D. Now if we put these two together: respecting other people's autonomy is a justifiable reason for following their moral beliefs and principles from a rational perspective; therefore, oftentimes the greatest total happiness requires us to act in accordance to moral principles A-D (that is, refrain from acting selfishly, not intentionally or knowingly causing harm or suffering to others, etc.).",
