As the number of sprints increases, the proportion of anaerobic training increases, leading to higher contribution of anaerobic performance.\n\n2. The anaerobic contribution increases as a result of the increased number of sprints, leading to performance fatigue.\n\n3. A reduction in the anaerobic contribution occurs as a need for rest and recovery is required while the aerobic training component remains comparatively unchanged.\n\n4. As a result, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism decreases while anaerobic metabolism is proportionally increased. Answer: D. The production of lactic acid within the muscle increases due to a decreased contribution of aerobic metabolism and a production of lactic acid within the muscle, leading to performance fatigue.",

Diplopia will never occur if one eye is covered as it is caused by abnormal convergence of the eyes and would require the covers being removed to allow for divergent viewing. \n2. B) False, while the conclusions may be true, it is the other way around. The outer image must always be the true image due to the position of the brain and eye position, so it is true. \n3. False, since squinting is the result of under- or over-correcting for double vision caused by a 6th cranial nerve palsy. There is no direct relationship between a divergent squint and a 6th cranial nerve palsy as this statement proposes. \n4. Numerous p.
