            "model_answer": "The answer is B) Tariki. Firstly, 'tariki' is a verb meaning 'to arrange or decorate flowers'. Therefore, the term 'Zazen' does not fit, as it is a term for a Zen meditation practice. The term 'Kami' could be interpreted as a deity or a spiritual concept, and does not apply directly to the art of flower arrangement. The term 'iki' in 'ikebana' means 'art arrangement' or 'arrangement art', and hence is more akin to 'art arrangement'. Finally, both 'iki' and 'tariki' have a word character that does not fit, so the answer is B) Tariki.",
