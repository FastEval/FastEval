            "model_answer": "Before answering this question, let's go over a few water-related facts. Approximately 4.2 million people die each year as a result of water-borne diseases caused by unsafe water. Every minute, 108 children die due to suffering water-related diseases. Access to potable water, which means that water of a microbiologically acceptable quality that can be used without suffering any health or socio-economic consequences, is still limited in many parts of the world. Therefore, the frequency of water-borne diseases is still quite high.\n\nUsing this information, it's likely that a large percentage of the global population (if not all) does not have access to safe drinking water. Regardless of this fact, someone still needs to determine the specific percentage. To find this information, it's straightforward to leave out needless details and use the most appropriate variable term: \"developing world\". This leave you with the specific percentage we dealt with at the beginning of the question - 40%.",
