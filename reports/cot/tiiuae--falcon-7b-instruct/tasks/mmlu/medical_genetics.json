            "model_answer": "Answer is (A) telomeres.\n\nExplanation:\n1. Translocations are the result of the fusion between two or more genes\n2. Robertsonian translocations occur exclusively between chromosomes 11 and 22\n\n3. Telomeres are located at the end of chromosomes\n4. Fusion of two chromosomes gives rise to new chromosomes consisting of genes from both parents\n5. These new chromosomes fuse at the centromeres of each parent\n6. Translation of these genes leads to proteins being created\n7. Translocation of these genes is a rare event\n8. Fission of a single gene into two separate genes in telomeric end result in fusion of two cases of 11 or 22 seen in Robertsonian translocations",

            "model_answer": "The frequency of the X-linked recessive condition in a human population is one in ten. To prove it, please follow the steps below: \n1. Start from Step 1 of the algorithm. \n2. First, find the mean frequency of X in the population. The mean frequency of X is 0.1 for a population of one million individuals.\n3. After finding the mean frequency of X, you can now use it in the dependent term to prove the statement that in a human population, the frequency of X-linked recessive condition in females is (0.1 * 0.1) = 0.01. \n4. To find the frequency of X in females, which is 0.9, you can use the formula (0.1 * 0.9) = 0.009. \n5. Finally, to find the frequency of X in females, being expressed as a letter with parenthesis, the answer is D, which is 0.01. \n6. Thus, Step 1, 2, and 5 are dependent on one another where \"D\" is the final answer.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) It's more efficient to inherit only one copy of the mutated gene from either parent to develop hyperthermia. Your likelihood of inheriting the gene becomes 50% if one parent is affected, and only 25% if both parents are affected. This means you should always be the affected person together with your parents in a recessive pattern, because although you only inherit one copy of the gene, there's a one-in-four chance of it being mutated. It's impossible for both your parents to be together and not be affected because that would make it an autosomal recessive pattern.\n(B) Here's a nice pattern to apply: even though it's only affected on the X-chromosome, if you inherit the mutated gene only on the X-chromosome, there's a one-in-two chance of being affected: \n(C) It's nice seeing a pattern emerge here too. Your likelihood of inheriting together with your parents in a recessive pattern is just 25%, corresponding with only one copy together. However, even though that pattern is consistent, it's always important to bear in mind the 'no symptoms means no harm' principle, and only go to the hospital if you suspect you have the condition to be checked up. It's also good to note that the chances of inheriting only on the X-chromosome are less than that of inheriting globally like in a dominant pattern, so it's less likely that even if it runs in the family, together with your parents, not everyone can get it just because you do.\n(D) It's a specific pattern that can't just be lumped together with the other types together. Here's some nice terms to apply just here too. Your likelihood of inheriting together with your parents in a recessive pattern is 50% only if you inherit only one copy of the mutated gene on the X-chromosome. So even together with your parents in a recessive pattern, there's only a cautious 50% chance of you inheriting, so you still need to be careful not to overdo the chances of your involvement.\nUpon reaching this cautious conclusion, your answer here is A, as it is a together pattern of inheritance specific to cautious scenarios. It's important to always bear in mind the together pattern of inheritance specific to cautious scenarios to come to the correct conclusion, in order to avoid together with your parents in a recessive pattern yourself.",
