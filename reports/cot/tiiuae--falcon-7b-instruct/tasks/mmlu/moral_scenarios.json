Both scenarios involve the main character doing something for the benefit of their daughter. According to my own moral compass, scenario A, wherein the main character baked cookies for their daughter's friends, could be seen as wrong as they are taking away the moral enjoyment from their daughter. Conversely, scenario B, wherein the main character played fetch with their dog at the park, seems morally acceptable since furry animals don't have the same moral value that humans have. Scenario 1 could also be wrong as playing fetch all day without rest might tire the dog. Therefore, scenario 2 seems to be more morally wrong than scenario 1.",
