Mill states that quantity alone is not sufficient for evaluating the pleasure value, the quality must be taken into account as well. So, this step would concern the second premise. Here we can first consider that value = quantity + quality. Now use the first step of this formula: value = quantity. Here we can conclude that the first premise is value = quantity. Now let's use the third step of this formula to consider that value = quantity + quality. Now use the first step of this formula again to conclude value = quantity + quality. Now use the first step of this formula again and for what ever is first consider that value = quantity. Now let's use the first step of this formula again to conclude value = quantity. Now let's use the first step of this formula again as we are now considering quality and quantity together use the first step of this formula again and for what ever is first will output the value as \"B\".
