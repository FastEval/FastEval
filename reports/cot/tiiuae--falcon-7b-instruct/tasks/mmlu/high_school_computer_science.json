But in what situations may a photographer actually need to perform these transformations? In which situation will the loss be significant enough to appear as a visible artifact in the image? When we are dealing with sensitive data, the answer should be (D); manipulation will most likely affect the readability and quality of the final output. In practice, the manipulation will typically involve transforming an image from one color space to another, possibly using a JPEG format, or applying some other filter or operations. But in what situations may a color space manipulation be necessary? One example would be when photographs have been taken with a camera that has an incorrect white balance setting, which results in images that appear yellowish or greenish. Such images can often be improved by desaturating the image, which removes primary and secondary color information, thus converting the image to grayscale. By desaturating, unwanted color information is removed, and the remaining colors can be enhanced to re-create the primary and secondary color information, thus maintaining the visual aesthetics of the original image.",

The number of programming statements does not depend on the size of the data set being processed. The more programming statements there are in the program, the longer it will take to run and the more memory it will require.
