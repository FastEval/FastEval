            "model_answer": "D. 40 pm, 995 kJ/mol. Here is my reasoning: \n\nThe atomic radius of carbon is 77 pm. As the radius increases, so does the number of protons needed to complete the atom. Carbon has 6 protons so, for 40 pm, there would be 80 protons. Since the first ionization energy of carbon is 1086 kJ/mol, we need to calculate the number of speed energies of 40 protons (kJ/mol). This can be done using the formula E(subscript 40) = T(subscript 40) - E(subscript 4), where E(subscript 40) = -8.64 eV, and E(subscript 4) = 8.978 eV from the atomic radius formula (77 p). So, the speed energy of 40 protons is -8.64 kJ/mol. The final answer is letter D = 40 pm + (4000kJ/mol).",
