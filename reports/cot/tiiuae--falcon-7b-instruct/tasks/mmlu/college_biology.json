Each parent must be homozygotes for their recessive alleles to satisfy the law. Step 3: Which alleles are making up the genotypic constitution of the organism based on the parent's homozygosities? Therefore, follow step 3.Just print the recessive intercourse allele, followed by the dominant intercourse allele, denoted by parenthesis. \n\nAfter completing this question, output the answer: B. The reason for this answer is based on the natural selection causing carrier frequency of genes to increase in population. The color of an allele is inherited based on carrier frequency of that allele in the current population of organisms, therefore the recessive intercourse allele (df) has a higher frequency of color, which results in the natural selection causing carrier frequency of that allele to increase. The color of an allele is inherited based on carrier frequency of that allele in the current population of organisms, therefore the recessive intercourse allele (effectively, bacmthe dark recessive P) has a higher frequency of color than the recessive intercourse allele (effectively, abc).
