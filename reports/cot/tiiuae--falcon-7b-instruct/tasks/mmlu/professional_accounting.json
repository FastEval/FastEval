If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The final answer is A) 164%.\nThe reasoning steps:\n1. Find the product of the car cost and the hiring cost for 260 days a year = $108,600. \n2. Divide this by the hiring cost per day = 108,600/245 = $4,350. \n3. Multiply by the 260 days of the year = 4,350*260 = 108,600. \n4. The product of the car cost and the hiring cost is equal to $98,600. \n5. To find the estimated yearly yield, divide the yearly cost by the price per hour and multiply by 365 days in a year = 98,600/245 = $0.450. \n6. Therefore, the estimation yields a yearly yield of (108,600/245)/365*365 = 0.45% = $4,350.",

Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson\u2019s individual tax return.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Please reveal your calculation here.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. The corporation reported $400K in income.\n2. Carson owns 40% of the outstanding stock, so his share of the income is $400K / 100% = $40K.\n3. Carson accurately reported $28K in gross income on his tax return.\n4. To calculate the amount of Carson's owner-level income, we can assume a proportional distribution of the corporation's taxable income, owner's share.\n5. The owner's share is 40% of the corporation's taxable income. The corporation had $400K in taxable income.\n6. The owner's share of the taxable income is owner's share * 400K.\n7. The owner's share of owner's share is 0.4 * 400K.\n8. As Carson reported $28K in gross income, we can conclude that owner's share of the income is 0.28.\n\nFinally, we add owner's share of the income (0.28) to the final answer (28K). Therefore, the answer is (A) $28,000.",
