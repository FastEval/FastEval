            "question": "The ecological approach to urban sociology involved studying:\n\n(A) how social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources\n(B) the forms of wildlife and natural habitats that could be found on the edges of the city\n(C) the way in which people organized collective protests about environmental issues\n(D) how men and women used the city's public spaces differently",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "1. I begin by defining the two main components in the concept of ecological urban sociology: ecology and sociology. Ecology is the study of everything that is related to nature, specifically the environment. Sociology, on the other hand, focuses on studying human culture, relationships, and society.\n\n2. Ecological urban sociology is based on the understanding that cities and their surrounding environments are interactive and interconnected.  The environment, including natural and man-made features of the city shape and influence how people interact with each other and with the city.\n\n3. Next, I would explain how the concept of \"ecological niche\" can be used to study colonization by social groups. Niche refers to the space or area that monoecious organisms can inhabit. Similarly, in cities, this concept can be used to study monoecious (single-gendered) spaces that social groups have colonized.\n\n4. I would then explain the concept of \"resource competition\" in relation to collective protests. Resource includes materials, such as land, water, and natural resources. Resource competition is the process by which social groups compete to control access to these resources.\n\n5. Lastly, I would explain how the concept of \"gendered spaces\" can be used to explain the differences in how men and women use the city's public spaces. Gendered space refers to the spatial and material boundaries that separate men and women. These boundaries can create separate spheres of conduct, beliefs, and values.\n\n6. Based on this reasoning, I believe the final answer should be \"B\". Since ecological urban sociology focuses on the concept of resource competition and monoecious spaces, the ecological approach has two main components: the concept of ecology (nature) and sociology (society). The concept of \"gendered spaces\" is directly based on gender differences, specifically how monoecious spaces are perceived and conducted.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(4)\n\nA) Owners still had control through shareholders and interlocking directorships. This is based on the fact that in corporations, the majority of the shares are held by one or a few individuals or groups of individuals, who have the power to elect the board of directors, and thus influence the decisions made. This means that the owners still held a lot of power, even though they didn't directly control most of the businesses.\n\nB) Ownership and management were becoming increasingly separate functions. At most companies, there was an overarching board of directors responsible for strategic decisions, and lower levels of management were responsible for day-to-day activities. While there was still an overlap of responsibilities, the general trend was towards separation.\n\nC) The techniques of scientific management were overly bureaucratic and inefficient. This explains the desire for less rules and more performance-based decision making in the 'managerial revolution'. Scientific management, or the idea of breaking down complex tasks into small, isolated components, was generally believed to be inefficient, as it takes too much time and energy to enforce.\n\nD) Managers were becoming dissatisfied with their working conditions and planned to overthrow the owners. If managers were unhappy, their desire for greater efficiency and autonomy explains their desire to overthrow the owners. This reason is based both on A) and B) - since there were issues with the performance-based decision making in companies, which would lead to dissatisfaction among certain groups of employees, and the desire for greater autonomy and efficiency by B) explains the desire to overthrow the owners by means of A) and inherits the performance-based decision making in A) which would lead to the desire for less rules and more performance-based decision making in A) which would lead to the desire to overthrow the owners by means of B) and inherits the need for greater autonomy and efficiency in B)\n\nThe final answer is 'D'. In the debate about the 'managerial revolution', John Scott (1997) argued that the owners still held a lot of power, even though they didn't directly control most of the businesses. The desire for greater efficiency and autonomy explains Scott's argument for a separation of ownership and management, and allows both a reason (B) and result (D) and overall conclusion (A).",
