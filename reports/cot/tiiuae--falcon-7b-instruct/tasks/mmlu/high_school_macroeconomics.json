When nominal intrinsic values fall, or when nominal GDP falls, households experience inflationary pressure. In these situations, households make more of their existing money (handily stored in assets) buying fewer goods and services.\n\nThe reasoning is that in both nominal inflationary and nominal recession situations, intrinsic values fall using monetary as an asset hedging mechanism.
