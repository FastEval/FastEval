Moreover, it may be the case that some parts of the body are more sexually sensitive than others and may be the main sites of response for that person.These relationships are dependent on each individual and may vary widely depending on the person's biology and the extent to which they have adjusted their perception of physical touch.Therefore, in general, it is difficult to give regions that are generally universally sexually-exciting.",
