An easy and more concise way to find the loop gain is to use a derivative calculator online. An easy and more concise way to find the gain is to back calculation it. That is, find A = A+B and then use step 1 to find the closed loop gain, step 2 to find the loop gain, step 1 to find the closed loop gain, step 2 to back calculation the loop gain and the phase of a feedback signal in general.",

Now, we have a choice between (B), for NOR, NAND, and (A), for NOR, NAND, and XNOR. \n\nA logical NOT operation does not change the output of a NOR gate. XNOR performs a series of operations to get a result. So for this set of logic gates, both (B) and (A) can be considered as universal gates.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) with XOR.",
