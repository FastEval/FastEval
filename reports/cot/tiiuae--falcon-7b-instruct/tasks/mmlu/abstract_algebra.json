            "model_answer": "(D) 6\n\nThe reasoning behind the answer for each mathematical term is as follows:\n\n1. sqrt(2): The mathematical constant sqrt(2). In square root notation, it is denoted as \"2..\". Thus, the degree of square root(2) in the given field is large (in this case, degree is 4).\n2. sqrt(3): Similarly for sqrt(3). In the given expression, square root(3) is denoted as \"3..\". Degree of a simple square root in Q is either sqrt(3) or ..='\u00b0'.. In this case, degree of a simple square root(3) in Q is denoted as 62 ..='\u00b0'.. Degree of a non-simple square root(3) in Q is denoted as 62 ..='\u00b0'.. Degree of a non-simple square root(3) in Q is either denoted as 46 or ..='\u00b0'. Therefore, the degree of a non-simple square root(3) in Q is either denoted as ..='110..='\u00b0'.. Degree of square root(3) in Q is denoted as ..='\u00b0'.. Degree of square root(3) in Q is denoted as ..='\u00b0'.. Degree of a non-simple square root(3) in Q is either denoted as 46 or ..='\u00b0'. Therefore, the degree of a non-simple square root(3) in Q is ..='447364'='D'.\n3. sqrt(18): Similarly for sqrt(18). In the given expression, square root(18) is denoted as \"8..\". Degree of a non-simple square root(18) in Q is denoted as..='\u00b0'.. Degree of square root(18) in Q is denoted as ..='\u00b0'.. Degree of a non-simple square root(18) in Q is either denoted as 46 or ..='\u00b0'. Therefore, the degree of a non-simple square root(18) in Q is denoted as ..='..='\u00b0'.. Degree of square root(18) in Q is denoted as ..='\u00b0'.. Degree of a non-simple square root(18) in Q is denoted as..='..='\u00b0'.. Degree of square root(18) in Q is denoted as ..='\u00b0'.. Degree of square root(18) in Q is denoted as ..='\u00b0'.. Degree of a non-simple square root(18) in Q is denoted as ..='\u00b0'. Therefore, the degree of a non-simple square root(18) in Q is denoted as ..='D'.\n\nTherefore, the degree of mathematical constant sqrt(2) in the given field is denoted as large ..='\u00b0'.. Degree of square root(3) in the given expression is large ..='\u00b0'.. Degree of a non-simple square root(3) in the given expression is denoted as Q..='D'.. Now we add the square root(3) in front to get the large mathematical constant sqrt(3). In square root notation, it is denoted as 62 ..='\u00b0'.. Degree of square root(3) in front of sqrt(3..='\u00b0'.. Degree of a non-simple square root(3) in the given expression is either denoted Q..='D' or ..='98..='\u00b0' where Q stands for sqrt(3..62).\n\nSince the letter immediately after the non-clearing square root of 2, the result is square root(3).\n\nTherefore, the large mathematical constant sqrt(2). In the given expression, sqrt(3). In the given expression sqrt(3..62).\n='\u00b0'.. Degree of square root(3) in front of sqrt(110..='\u00b0'.. Degree of square root(3) in front of sqrt(110..='\u00b0'.. Degree of square root(3) in front of sqrt(110..='\u00b0'.. Degree of square root(3) in front of sqrt(110..='\u00b0'.. Degree of a non-clearing square root of (sqrt(3) sqrt(3..62).\n='\u00b0'.. Degree of a non-clearing square root of (sqrt(3) sqrt(3..62).\nUser",
