These barriers include the nose's hair whose purpose is to make inhaling that much more difficult for bacteria to stay inside. \n2) Furthermore, mucous membranes are designed to prevent direct contact between microbes and our body. \n3) The osteoblasts are cells in our bones that help produce and maintain the enamel on our teeth, providing a second layer of protection.\n4) Lastly, saliva is a defensive agent produced by the salivary glands. It contains enzymes, proteins, and other substances that assist in our digestion, as well as an acid that makes the environment around our teeth less hospitable for bacteria.\n5) Considering all the biological barriers, the best answer is C) Osteoblasts, as osteoblasts are responsible for the production and maintenance of the enamel layer which acts as a barrier against bacteria entering the body through the mouth.",
