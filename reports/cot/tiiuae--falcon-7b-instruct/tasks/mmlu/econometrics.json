A more responsive asset, with high leverage, would bounce back and forth more violently than a less responsive asset, with a smaller leverage. In practice, maximum and minimum values of asset prices can indeed exhibit such volatility, and this volatility can explain the shape of the news impact curve.\n\nStep 3: Determine a suitable model\nTo model news maximum and minimum values, straightforward exponential distributions provide a simple explanation, and they explain the shape of maximum and minimum values observed in news. A more responsive asset, with higher estimates of its maximum and minimum values, would rise and fall more rapidly in its maximum and minimum levels, and the shape of the news maximum and minimum values would indeed represent its non-symmetrical, rising shape.\n\nStep 4: Find the leverage effect\nFinally, to confirm maximum and minimum values observed in news can indeed exhibit high leverage, and the final shape of news maximum and minimum values would indeed represent its non-symmetrical, rising shape. This is in contrast to its symmetrical shapes for positive and negative disturbances as in maximum and minimum values observed in news.",
