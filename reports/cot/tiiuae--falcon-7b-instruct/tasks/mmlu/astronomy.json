I reached this answer by first identifying what is/are true, which are that Titan is the only outer solar system moon with evidence for recent geologic activity and the fact that Titan's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrocarbons. Since A) is true and B) is false, the answer will be D) because the question is asking which statements are true. Titan is also the largest moon in the solar system, making it false for A). The reason Titan has a thick atmosphere is because it has a deep ocean underneath its moon, and as a result, water vapor is constantly being given off, making the atmosphere thicker. This is true for B). The reason geologic activity has been detected on Titan is because of its proximity to Saturn, creating a heat source and allowing for methane features.

The Earth's atmosphere partially shields the surface of the Earth, providing some protection from impacts that could cause them to be partially or completely destroyed. In addition, the Moon has a much harder lunar regolith (a blanket of fine-grained material) that has been almost completely removed by the intense solar wind. This makes it difficult for the Moon to form layers of sedimentary rocks like the Earth, which create deep geological features like craters. Finally, the Moon's surface is lacking in surface water features, such as oceans and lakes, unlike the Earth, which contributes to its harder lunar lithology.",
