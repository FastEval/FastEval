Coombs states that while responding to a crisis, ((A)ignratiation would include reassuring the stakeholders that you are doing everything privately and (B)owning up would involve taking the blame while responding. In contrast, ((A)armingcircling the wagons and (B)relying on stakeholder relationships focus on privately communicating internally while answering questions outside the organization.
