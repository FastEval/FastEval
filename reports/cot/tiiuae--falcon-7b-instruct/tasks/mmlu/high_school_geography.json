The closer people are to finding a better spot to live in a place they used to stay, the less likely they are needing to move around the area. And vice versa.//\nTherefore, we can conclude the needing of people to move away from a certain space is the driving force of these push and pull factors. The final letter should contain the answer as A, as the relief of living in a better place is the most immediate cause for rewarding migration. //",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The best answer is (C) circular migration due to the reasons below. Circular migration involves individuals or families constantly moving back and forth between two or more countries. In the case of farm workers, they may reside in their home country, but work in a foreign country during peak seasons to earn money. As a result, a cycle of circular migration occurs including constant travel back and forth. The reasoning step-by-step: 1) Circular migration is a common occurrence among farm workers. 2) International migration occurs when people, including including farm workers cross national borders. 3) Chain migration usually occurs between a set of residence including parents and children. Circular migration is the most likely due to the cycle of travel between home and foreign residence including constant travel back and forth. The final letter should be 'C' which, when including parenthesis, becomes 'CCCCB' and there is only one letter, so including parenthesis leads to only the letter 'C'.",

            "model_answer": "1. A national holiday is probably not a centrifugal force as it does not reflect any specific religion or denomination.\n2. An attack by another country is also not as centrifugal force as it only affects a specific space rather than entire country.\n3. A charismatic national leader is also not a centrifugal force since their leadership style does not affect the entire country.\n4. A religion or denomination can be a centrifugal force as it has the potential to create a group of people who are similar in their beliefs and traditions, with potentially large impacts on surrounding areas.\n5. Having a national language probably contributes slightly to the development of a country as it creates a deeper sense of identity and unity. Having national differences in terms of beliefs can create divide in the country as it can weaken the sense of unity and make it difficult to progress.\n6. So, the final answer is (D). A charismatic national leader can act as a centripetal force in shaping the country's culture and values, and the country as a whole can become stronger and more focused through the collective actions of its people.",
