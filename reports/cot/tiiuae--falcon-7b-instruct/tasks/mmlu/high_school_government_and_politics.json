            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "I will solve this problem by listing each item's importance one-by-one and then selecting the most important one. \n\nFirst, let's consider the geographical area in which the child grows up. The child growing up in a peaceful country with a democratic government and an established set of laws will likely develop a set of values that reflect these attributes. Although the child may be influenced by family values, the environment in which the child lives would greatly influence these values. \n\nNext, let's consider the child's family political views. Family values and political views often intersect. In a democratic country, parents usually pass their personal values and beliefs, such as reverence for the rule of law and individual rights, to their children. Consequently, the child developing in this environment will likely adopt these values. \n\nRegarding the media, it plays a significant role in influencing politics by providing information about different political events. Moreover, movies, television, and the internet can impact the way children form their political views. \n\nFinally, religion may dissolve the difference between people and may influence religious values in particular. For example, some Christians may dissolve the difference between people by emphasizing family values and others from a particular religion may take their faith into the public life.\n\nThus, all these factors can play a significant role in forming a child's political views. No one can decide which factor is the most important or which is the primary contributor, which is why I am selecting the most important one for this problem. The answer would be \"A) The geographical area in which the child grows up\" assuming that the other factors impact the child's views in particular.",

Since the focus is on the Articles and not the Constitution, the answer is not to be found there. The answer is D) Appealing to the president to adjudicate disputes. This is because the final line of the Constitution reads: \u201cThe powers not delegated to the states nor prohibited to the states by the Constitution shall remain in the hands of the people\u2026\u201d Meaning, any power or jurisdiction not in the hands of the state governments nor prohibited by the Constitution is left with the people.
