            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "1. In 2020, which type of food is usually consumed in lower quantities in Wales? -> (A) Meat\n2. Next, let's consider the other options: (B) Conceptionery -> (B) Confectionary\n3. Then, the reasoning step: Why are confectionaries usually consumed in higher quantities than fruits and vegetables? -> Confectionary is usually more calorie-dense than fruits and vegetables and thus tends to be consumed in higher quantities. \n4. Now, let's consider fruits and vegetables. They are usually consumed more frequently than confectionaries. However, if the quantities are compared, we see that vegetables are consumed more than fruits. \n5. Lastly, the conclusion: therefore, the answer is (D) Potatoes, which tend to be consumed in even lower quantities than the other three options.",
