For example, if the current letter is \"A\", the three sets would look like {A, A,A, A, A, C}. \n\nNext, think about which types of letters typically occur in old age. The first set of old letters are the letters that are usually thicker, commonly known as the superior portion of the eye. The middle set of old letters are generally yellowing in appearance, which are located in the middle of the pupil. Next, take the letter or character you plan to use and put it in the third set. \n\nFinally, wrap everything together by specifying what type of pupil this character typically occur in.
