Adams, a banker, is similar to Schindler in the sense that he is a respected member of society who nevertheless is wrongly convicted, subjected to inhumane treatment, and ultimately becomes a master craftsman of deception and survival.\n\nOption (A) (12 Angry Men): Judge Rittenmeyer, alias: Schindler, uses his role as a judge to create a new identity for himself in order to protect Jews and Jewish people, which could be considered similar to Schindler in the sense that he is a German judge.\n\nOption (B) (Mo' Better Blues): While Alvie Rothstein's situation is similar to a number of individuals in the film, such as the Jewish people who are forced to assimilate in order to survive, Rothstein himself is not a \"targeted\" person.\n\nOption (C) (Mindhunter): While Holden Ford's career",

We can immediately cross it out.\n\nWe are left with (C) Forrest Gump and (D) Eddie the Eagle. While Jurassic Park could be compared to the nature of Jurassic World, the plot of the movie is still very different. In the opposite case, Forrest Gump matches the plot of Jurassic World - an innocent-looking, yet extraordinary child in a world full of danger due to his superior intellect. This movie doesn't fit.\n\nThus, the only option left is (D) Eddie the Eagle, which is a skiing movie similar in plot to The Silence of the Lambs, but in a completely different environment. While they are both sports movies, they have two worlds where Jurassic Park belongs to Jurassic-Park-science, whereas The Silence of the Lambs belongs to crime-thriller, and Eddie the Eagle is more family-comedy.
