You can get this answer by first listing the items in the row from left to right: a gold plate, a silver stress ball, a fuchsia notebook, a mauve bracelet, a green jug, and a yellow fidget spinner. There are two exceptions to the fuchsia notebook and a yellow stress ball. A fuchsia notebook does exist, as it is a specific type of notebook that can be found in the market. However, a yellow stress ball does not exist as a specific item. Therefore, the color of the right-most item in the list (green fidget spinner) must be the color of a fuchsia notebook. You can get this explanation through a series of eliminated options: a gold plate cannot be fuchsia for there are no yellow and fuchsia mixed in it; a silver stress ball cannot be fuchsia for silver and fuchsia are eliminated; a mauve bracelet cannot be fuchsia for there are no yellow and fuchsia mixed in it; and a yellow fidget spinner cannot be fuchsia for fuchsia and yellow are not eliminated. Each eliminated option eliminates one exception to the fuchsia notebook, that is, the option for a yellow stress ball and fuchsia bracelet. Therefore, a green fidget spinner must be the right-most item.",
