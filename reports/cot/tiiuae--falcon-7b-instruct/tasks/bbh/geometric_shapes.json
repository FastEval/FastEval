Define the term \"Kite\" if you are not familiar with it. A kite is a simple drawing made by connecting a series of points. This could be done simply by defining \"M\" for \"mid-line\" of each point. In this path, the line contains exactly 6 points, which forms a kite.\n2. Count the number of \"M\" drawings in each path. In the given path, there are 6 \"M\"s.\n3. The final letter of the resulting alphabet is \"C\".\n4. Thus, the answer is C.",

The eight line segments are connected and curved to draw the shape of a cross (T). The curve can also be extended to form an octagonal (O) shape by connecting the straight line segments at the end points of the curved line segments. Therefore, option (F) works. Answer: F",

The coordinates \"64.00,63.00\" are for the top-left corner of the element. \n4. The following line \"L 44.00,63.00\" draws a rectangle that occupies the position of the previous path element, using \"L\" (line to) command. \n5. The \"44.00\" is relative to the current path. \n6. The shape has two lines that compose a rectangle. \n7. This rectangle is inside a rectangle with bottom-left coordinates of 64.00, top-right coordinates of 68.00, and side-lengths of a \"circle\" and \"square\".\n8. Therefore, the final SVG path element is likely a \"circle\". \nAnswer: B",
