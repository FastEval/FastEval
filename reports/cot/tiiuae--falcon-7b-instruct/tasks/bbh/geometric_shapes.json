Therefore, it is a rectangle.\n(2) The coordinates are (25.82,45.12) and (26.90,27.04) which comprises of the angles of the triangle. Therefore, it is a triangle.\n(3) The last line of the path is constructed by the endpoint coordinates of line direction. Since the endpoint of line direction always terminates to a coordinate inside a shape, and each shape has its own set of angles and endpoints that need to be altered to create a pentagon direction. Since the SVG path does not have any specifications that define pentagon directions, it is not a sign of a pentagon. Therefore, it is not a pentagon. This means the path fulfills the condition for having all angles of a polygon be equal. Therefore, it is a polygon.\n\nAnswer: P",
