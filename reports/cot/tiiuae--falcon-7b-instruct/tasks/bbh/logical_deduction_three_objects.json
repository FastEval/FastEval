On a branch, there are three birds: a hummingbird, a blue jay, and a raven. The blue jay is to the right of the hummingbird. The raven is the second from the left.\nOptions:\n(A) The hummingbird is the rightmost\n(B) The blue jay is the rightmost\n(C) The raven is the rightmost",

            "model_answer": "The final answer is B. Firstly, the statement 'On a branch' implies that the three birds are arranged on a branch. Secondly, the direction indicated in the statements for two of the birds ('to the right' for the hummingbird and 'the rightmost' for the blue jay) makes it clear which bird is closest to the reader. Finally, a raven is often used habitually as an example of a high bird while the others are described as smaller.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is A. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Think of a location on the shelf to place the object with the largest size (the red book), so it is next to the next object that is large (the purple book). \n2. The location of the purple book is the one farthest to the right after the red book.\n3. The location of the yellow book is to the right of the purple book. \n4. The order of the objects in the paragraph is therefore: red - purple - yellow.",
