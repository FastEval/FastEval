Michael saw James driving to the water park from 6am to 7am. \n\nSubsequent steps: \n(1) Consider the weekdays: \n(A) Anthony is at the library during the weekdays and so James may have left earlier than 3pm. (B) William is at the cafe from 4pm to 9pm and so James may have left the water park earlier than 3pm. \n(2) Apply the logical structure: \n(A) If Michael saw James driving to the water park between 6am and 7am, then Michael can rule out going to the beach during that time (4am-4pm). \n(B) Likewise, if Anthony is reading at the library from 7am to 3pm, then James can rule out going to the beach before that. \n(C) Since it's a weekday, Michael can rule out going to the beach during the time between 9am to 5pm. \n(D) If Sean sees James walking near the Statue of Liberty between 5am-6am, then Sean can rule out James being at the beach. \n\nFinally, after considering all the constraints, there are only two possibilities: (A) between 7am and 3pm (which Michael can rule out); (B) after 9pm, when the beach is closed.

Since there is a rule about having to finish basketball practice by 6pm, and since it is unlikely that she played basketball until 6pm, we know that she had to be on the road after 6pm. On the other hand, we know that Sean saw Jessica waiting at the train station from 7am to 2pm, which means she had two hours to buy a bike and prepare for playing basketball, but she had until 2pm to play basketball, as she is the only one that can complete the game in two hours. However, since we know she has to buy a basketball ticket at a ticket counter that closes at 6pm, we can also deduce that she had until that time to play basketball.
