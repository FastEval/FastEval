ZP3 is the receptor protein that binds to ZP3 in the zona pellucida of the egg, while ZP2 is a different glycoprotein that is involved in sperm-zoon hybrid cell fusion. Therefore, the antibodies that bind to ZP3 are able to block the sperm's acrosomal reaction, while antibodies that bind to ZP2 are not able to do so.",
