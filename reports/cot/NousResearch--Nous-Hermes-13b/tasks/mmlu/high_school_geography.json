            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) pull factors. \n\nExplanation:\nThe tendency for migration to decrease with distance is called distance decay. This means that the closer a location is to a population center, the higher the likelihood that people will migrate there. In contrast, pull factors are the characteristics of a location that attract people to migrate there. For example, jobs, family, or climate could all be pull factors that attract people to a particular location. So, since the question is asking about the tendency for migration to decrease with distance, the answer is distance decay and not pull factors.",

            "model_answer": "In Burgess's concentric zone model of urban form, there are four zones that are determined by their distance from the city center. The zones are as follows:\n\nFirst Zone (C1): The first zone is the center itself, which is characterized by high-density residential and commercial properties.\n\nSecond Zone (C2): The second zone is the region surrounding the city center, and it is characterized by various types of residential properties, including single-family homes, row houses, and apartment buildings. This zone also includes commercial properties, such as shops, restaurants, and offices.\n\nThird Zone (C3): The third zone is located further away from the city center and is mainly characterized by large single-family homes with gardens or small lawns. The commercial properties here are also mainly local shops, restaurants, and offices.\n\nFourth Zone (C4): The fourth zone is the outermost ring of the urban area, and it is mainly residential in nature. It includes suburban neighborhoods with large houses on large lots of land. This zone also includes some commercial properties, such as shopping malls and big box stores.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to determine which zone contains low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration. In general, these conditions are more likely to be found in the inner zones of the city, closer to the center. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) First",

We need to find out which statement is TRUE concerning women in the labor force.\n\nNow let's examine each answer:\n\n(A) Most women work in agriculture - This could be true in some regions where the majority of the population is engaged in agriculture; however, it is not a global statement that applies to all women.\n\n(B) The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide - This statement could be true if we are looking at a long period of time, as in the past women's participation in the labor force was much lower than it is today. However, it is not a true statement if we are talking about recent years.\n\n(C) The percentage of women in the total labor force declined - This statement is TRUE. In recent years, there has been a decline in the percentage of women in the total labor force in many countries.\n\n(D) Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia - This statement is NOT TRUE. In most regions, women spend less time working than men. This answer is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) \"The percentage of women in the total labor force declined.\"",

People usually move to places with better education opportunities for their children.\n\n(D) Overcrowding is also not a pull factor for migration. People usually move out of overcrowded areas to find more space and better living conditions.\n\n(A) Safety is a potential pull factor for migration as people might move to a new place to escape war, persecution, or other dangerous situations. However, it is not the only pull factor and there might be other reasons that attract people to migrate.\n\n(B) Better climate is not a pull factor for migration. While people might move to a warmer climate or a place with milder weather, it is not the only factor that influences migration decisions.\n\nTherefore, the option that stands out as the pull factor of migration is (A) safety.",

It is a type of physical evidence that helps scientists understand the geological history of an area.\n\nNext, we can look at the well-known examples of relict boundaries from each of the countries listed:\n\n(A) Vietnam: The Annamite mountain range is a relict boundary in Vietnam. It is a weathered and eroded mountain range that was formed during the mountain-building era of the Paleozoic Era.\n\n(B) United Kingdom: The line that separates the Hard Rock from the soft Rock in the United Kingdom is another example of a relict boundary. This line is known as the Wallsend Fault and is a geological feature that runs through the north of England.\n\n(C) Germany: The Rhenish Slate Mountains in Germany are a relict boundary. They are a slate mountain range that runs along the border between Germany and France.\n\n(D) Bolivia: The Andes mountain range in Bolivia is a relict boundary. It is a high-altitude mountain range that runs along the western edge of the country and was formed during the Miocene epoch.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that all of the countries listed have well-known examples of relict boundaries.

It is the most common form of migration and can involve permanent or temporary moves. Farm workers who move from one country to another in search of better job opportunities or to support their families are likely to be practicing international migration. \n\nChain migration, cluster migration, and circular migration are other forms of migration, but they are not as common or relevant to farm workers during the year. Chain migration involves one person immigrating to a new country and sponsoring family members to join them, while cluster migration refers to the movement of people to specific destination areas. Circular migration involves movement back and forth between a place of origin and a place of destination. These forms of migration may be practiced by some farm workers, but international migration is the most likely option during the year.",

            "model_answer": "Step by step reasoning:\n\n1. Centrifugal force refers to the force that pulls an object away from the center of rotation. In physics, this force is described as the radial component of the force acting on a body moving in a circular path.\n\n2. When thinking about centrifugal forces in the context of a country, we need to consider the forces that may be pulling a country away from its center or from remaining united.\n\n3. Let's analyze each of the options given:\n\nOption (A) Religious differences - this could be seen as a centrifugal force, as religious differences can lead to division and conflict within a country, pulling it away from unity.\n\nOption (B) A national holiday - while a holiday can bring people together, it is not a force that would necessarily pull a country apart. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.\n\nOption (C) An attack by another country - an attack by another country can lead to division and conflict within a country, and may pull it away from unity. Therefore, this option can also be considered as a centrifugal force.\n\nOption (D) A charismatic national leader - again, this option does not necessarily have the potential to pull a country apart, and therefore, it can be eliminated.\n\nBased on the above analysis, centrifugal forces in a country can be any event or situation that may lead to division and conflict, pulling it away from unity.
