            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically is the lack of a currency. \n\nExplanation: A subsistence economy is a type of economy where people rely on their own resources to meet their basic needs. They usually do not have a formal currency, and they may not have a well-connected transportation infrastructure, government activity or a banking service. However, among these options, the lack of a currency is the key factor that prevents them from advancing economically. Without a currency, people cannot engage in transactions with others, and they cannot accumulate wealth or invest in their future. Therefore, it is the lack of a currency that prevents subsistence economies from moving forward.",

            "model_answer": "The final choice depends on our definition of \"tendency for a population to continue to grow long after replacement fertility has been achieved.\" This concept is most closely aligned with (A) zero population growth. \n\n(A) zero population growth: This refers to a situation where the population growth rate slows down to a level where the number of births equals the number of deaths, leading to a stable population size. At this point, neither growth nor decline is observed, so in this context, the term \"zero population growth\" could be used interchangeably with \"stable population size\" or \"no growth\" but not with \"continued growth\" or \"rapid growth rate,\" which are inconsistent with the concept.",

In Burgess's concentric zone model of urban form, the inner zone is the city center where business and government activities are concentrated. The second zone is the working class residential area.

Even in developing countries, the percentage of women in agriculture is declining.\n\n(B) The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide - This statement is true. According to the World Bank, the gender gap in the labor force participation rate has widened between 2000 and 2018 in almost all regions of the world.\n\n(C) The percentage of women in the total labor force declined - This statement is not specific enough to be categorized as true or false. It depends on the region being considered. \n\n(D) Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia - This statement is false. Women in most regions work fewer hours per day than men, according to statistics from the International Labour Organization and the World Bank.\n\nBased on the analysis of the statements, the only true statement is (B).

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we need to look at each factor and decide which one is not a pull factor.\n\n(A) Safety: If a place is dangerous, it can act as a push factor, pushing people to leave that place. However, if a place is safe, it can act as a pull factor, attracting people to come and live there. Therefore, safety can be considered a pull factor of migration.\n\n(B) Better climate: If a place has a better climate than another place, it can act as a pull factor, attracting people who want to enjoy a more comfortable climate. Therefore, better climate can be considered a pull factor of migration.\n\n(C) Better schools: If a place has better schools than another place, it can act as a pull factor, attracting people who want to provide the best education for their children. Therefore, better schools can be considered a pull factor of migration.\n\n(D) Overcrowding: If a place is overcrowded, it can act as a push factor, pushing people to leave that place and go to another place where there is more space. Therefore, overcrowding can be considered a push factor of migration.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the correct answer is (D) overcrowding, as it is the only factor that is not a pull factor of migration.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First, let's understand what a relict boundary is. A relict boundary is a geological feature that was formed during the formation of a continent or supercontinent and has been preserved despite the subsequent breakup and movement of the Earth's crust. \n\nNow, let's examine the countries mentioned in the question:\n\n(A) Vietnam: Vietnam has a diverse geography with a lot of folded and faulted terranes that have been intensely deformed and uplifted. This suggests that there may be relict boundaries in Vietnam, but without more specific information, we cannot definitively say whether or not there is a well-known example of a relict boundary in Vietnam.\n\n(B) United Kingdom: The United Kingdom consists of two main landmasses (Great Britain and Ireland) that were joined together in the past. Fold mountains and other geological features indicate the presence of relict boundaries within the UK. Therefore, the United Kingdom has an example of a relict boundary.\n\n(C) Germany: Germany is located in the heart of Europe, and like many countries in the region, it has been subjected to a variety of tectonic forces in the past. There are indications that Germany may have relict boundaries, but more research would be needed to confirm their presence and identify specific examples.\n\n(D) Bolivia: Bolivia is located in South America and has been subjected to a variety of geological processes over millions of years. There is evidence to suggest that there may be relict boundaries in Bolivia, but without more specific information, we cannot definitively say whether or not there is a well-known example of a relict boundary in Bolivia.\n\nBased on the information provided, the answer is (B) United Kingdom.",

Let's examine each of the options: \n   - (A) Religious differences: These may be important in a country, but they do not actively push things away from a centre. \n   - (B) A national holiday: A holiday is a time of rest and celebration, not something that pushes a country apart. \n   - (D) A charismatic national leader: While a leader can be influential, they do not inherently push a country apart. \n   - (C) An attack by another country: This is an external force that can potentially push a country apart or push it towards unity, depending on the context. \n\nTherefore, the option that represents a centrifugal force is (C) An attack by another country.",

However, this climate does not directly explain the reason for population density along coastlines and rivers.\n\n(B) Limited forest cover - A possible explanation for early settlements along coastlines and rivers could be the availability of natural resources such as timber and fertile land. However, this answer does not explain the present-day high population density along these areas.\n\n(C) Growth of manufacturing - The growth of manufacturing industries could have led to the development of major cities along coastlines and rivers, where transportation and communication were easier. However, this answer does not explain the establishment of settlements in the first place.\n\n(D) Access to trade routes - The availability of navigable rivers and coastlines for trade and transportation would have been a significant factor in the early establishment of settlements along these areas. Coastlines and rivers provided easier access to trade routes, which connected different civilizations and promoted economic growth. Thus, access to trade routes is the most plausible answer.\n\nThe final answer is (D) Access to trade routes.",
