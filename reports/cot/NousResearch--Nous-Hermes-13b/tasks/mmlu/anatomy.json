            "model_answer": "1. The facial nerve, also known as the seventh cranial nerve, is responsible for facial movement and sensation. \n2. It courses through several areas in the head before exiting through the stylomastoid foramen in the parotid gland. \n3. The stylomastoid foramen is a small opening on the lateral edge of the mastoid process of the skull, where the facial nerve emerges. \n4. A lesion that compresses the nerve at this point or within the skull base can lead to ipsilateral paralysis of the facial muscles. \n5. This is because the nerve fibers that control the muscles are located on one side of the nerve, and since the nerve is compressed, the signal cannot reach the muscles on that side.\n6. Therefore, the answer is (A) paralysis of the facial muscles.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is A. \n\nA \"dished face\" profile is often associated with a recessive maxilla due to failure of elongation of the cranial base. \n\nHere's how to arrive at the answer:\n\nA \"dished face\" profile is characterized by a downturned or concave appearance of the lower face. The shape of the face is primarily determined by the position, size, and shape of the underlying bones. \n\nAmong the given options, only (A) and (B) are related to bone development and growth. \n\nWhile (B) discusses failure of elongation of the cranial base, it is not the correct answer because it focuses on failure of elongation, not on recession. \n\nHowever, (A) explains that a \"dished face\" profile is often associated with a protruding mandible due to reactivation of the condylar cartilage by acromegaly. Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder characterized by excessive growth hormone secretion, which can cause an overgrowth of various body tissues, including bones. In this case, the condylar cartilage, which is responsible for the shape and position of the mandible, can grow excessively, causing the mandible to protrude forward and give the face a concave appearance. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) a protruding mandible due to reactivation of the condylar cartilage by acromegaly.",

Ectomesenchyme is a non-cellular extracellular matrix that provides support and organization to tissues. It differentiates into various cell types during development. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to deduce the answer:\n\n1. Motor neurons: Motor neurons are derived from the neural tube, which is not part of the ectomesenchyme.\n\n2. Skeletal muscles: Skeletal muscles are derived from somites, which are formed from the mesoderm layer of the embryo. While mesoderm is derived from ectoderm and endoderm, skeletal muscles are not directly derived from ectomesenchyme.\n\n3. Melanocytes: Melanocytes are derived from the neural crest, which is also not part of the ectomesenchyme.\n\n4. Sweat glands: Sweat glands are derived from the dermatome, which is also not part of the ectomesenchyme.\n\nBased on the explanation, none of the given options are directly derived from ectomesenchyme. However, (B) Skeletal muscles are the closest in origin, as they are derived from the mesoderm layer, which is part of the embryonic mesenchyme. Therefore, the answer is (B) Skeletal muscles.",

The glomerulus filters blood under high pressure and the filtrate then enters the renal tubule. The afferent arteriole transports blood to the glomerulus, so it is not the answer. The loop of Henle plays a role in concentrating urine by creating a concentration gradient, so it is also not the answer. The renal pelvis is the chamber of the kidney where the ureter enters and the renal artery leaves, so it is not the answer either. Therefore, the correct answer is: \n\nA) Afferent arteriole",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the basic function of the spinal cord. The spinal cord is a long, thin, tubular bundle of nervous tissue and support cells that extends from the medulla oblongata in the brainstem down to the lumbar region of the vertebral column. It is responsible for transmitting sensory, motor, and autonomic signals between the brain and the rest of the body. \n\nNext, we need to recognize the Cervical vertebrae are the first seven vertebral segments of the vertebral column and are located in the neck. The sixth cervical vertebra, also known as the axis, is located at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra. The sixth cervical vertebra is unique for its specialized structure and function, as it allows for a greater range of motion in the neck.\n\nWhen a patient suffers a broken neck with damage to the spinal cord at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra, it means that there is an injury to the spinal cord in the neck which could result in damage to the nerve fibers that transmit signals to and from the brain. This could potentially impact the nerves that control the muscles responsible for breathing.\n\nConsidering the possible impact on breathing, the answer is (D) Breathing will be unaffected. However, it is essential to note that the severity of the impact on breathing will depend on the extent of the damage to the spinal cord. In some cases, the damage may be minimal and have little to no impact on breathing. In other cases, it could result in serious complications such as respiratory failure.",

They produce mucus, which is a viscous fluid that traps bacteria and other foreign particles, preventing them from entering the body. This is the body's first line of defense against environmental bacteria.\n\nHair in the nose and osteoblasts are related to other functions in the body. Hair in the nose is not directly related to the defense against bacteria. Osteoblasts are responsible for the formation of bones, but they do not play a role in the body's defense mechanism against environmental bacteria.\n\nSaliva also serves a function in maintaining oral health, but it is not a defense mechanism against environmental bacteria.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to follow a thought process to determine which option best matches the description given. \n\n1. The primary motor cortex is a part of the brain that is responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movements. \n\n2. Therefore, when activity in the primary motor cortex increases, it should result in some form of muscle contraction. \n\n3. However, the exact type of muscle contraction depends on the specific function of the primary motor cortex and how it is connected to other parts of the brain and spinal cord.\n\n4. Therefore, the correct answer must be an option that involves some type of muscle contraction.\n\n5. Now we need to eliminate the options that do not involve muscle contraction. Option A, \"bilateral contraction of antigravity limb muscles,\" is incorrect because it involves contraction of muscles on both sides of the body, unlike the primary motor cortex which primarily controls the movements of one side of the body. \n\n6. Option B, \"bilateral contraction of limb musculature,\" is also incorrect because it is too general and does not specify which muscles are being contra\n\n7. None of the other options specifically mention muscle contraction, so for the answer to be correct, it must involve contraction in some way.\n\n8. Therefore, the correct answer is D) \"contraction of contralateral limb musculature.\" This option refers to the contraction of muscles on the opposite side of the body, which is the typical function of the primary motor cortex.",
