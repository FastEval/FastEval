            "model_answer": "The facial nerve, also known as the cranial nerve VII, is responsible for facial movements and sensations, including taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. \n\nWhen a lesion causes compression of the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen, it disrupts the normal function of the nerve, leading to ipsilateral paralysis of the facial muscles. \n\nThis paralysis affects both the voluntary and involuntary movements of the facial muscles, which in turn leads to the clinical features described by option (A) paralysis of the facial muscles. \n\nOption (B) is incorrect as taste is not directly affected by the facial nerve, although the inability to close the eye may lead to exposure and drying of the eye, which could potentially affect taste through mechanical irritation. Option (C) is correct as the paralysis of the facial muscles, loss of taste and lacrimation are typical symptoms of facial nerve palsy, while option (D) is incorrect as decreased salivation is not a typical symptom of facial nerve palsy.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To solve this question, we need to determine which facial feature is associated with a \"dished face\" profile. \n\nA \"dished face\" profile refers to a facial profile that is concave in shape, like the inside of a bowl. This type of profile can be caused by several different factors, including problems with the jaw, maxilla, or frontal bone. \n\nWe can eliminate option (D) - defective development of the maxillary air sinus - because this option is unrelated to the shape of the face and would not cause a concave profile. \n\nFor the remaining options - (A) a protruding mandible due to reactivation of the condylar cartilage by acromegaly, (B) a recessive maxilla due to failure of elongation of the cranial base, and (C) an enlarged frontal bone due to hydrocephaly - we need to consider which one is most likely to cause a concave profile. \n\nOption (C) - an enlarged frontal bone due to hydrocephaly - could potentially cause a concave profile if the enlarged frontal bone pushes the other facial bones inward. However, this is not the most common cause of a \"dished face\" profile. \n\nThe most common cause of a \"dished face\" profile is a recessive maxilla, as explained in option (B). This is because the maxilla is the bone that forms the majority of the upper jaw and the upper part of the face. If the maxilla fails to elongate properly during development, it can cause the entire face to have a concave shape. \n\nTherefore, the answer is option (B) - a recessive maxilla due to failure of elongation of the cranial base.",

The urine collects in the bladder, which is a muscular, hollow organ responsible for storing urine until it's ready to be expelled from the body.\n4. The last step is the urethra, which is a tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body.\n\nTherefore, the structure that collects urine in the body is the bladder.

It is responsible for giving rise to several different tissues types, including skeletal muscles, motor neurons, and connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments.\n\nMotor neurons are derived from the ectoderm, the outermost layer of the developing embryo, and not from ectomesenchyme. Skeletal muscles are also derived from the ectoderm, but are closely associated with and influenced by the ectomesenchymal tissue during development. Melanocytes, which are pigment-producing cells, are also derived from the ectoderm and not from ectomesenchyme. Sweat glands, on the other hand, are derived from ectomesenchyme.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Sweat glands.",

The correct answer is (B) Glomerulus.\n\nThe kidney consists of several nephrons, each of which has a network of blood capillaries called the glomerulus. The glomerulus is surrounded by a cup-shaped structure called Bowman's capsule. The Bowman's capsule collects the filtrate produced by the glomerulus, which then passes through the loop of Henle and the tubules before being excreted from the kidney as urine.\n\nThe other structures mentioned (Afferent arteriole, Loop of Henle, and Renal pelvis) are also important parts of the nephron, but they do not contain the cluster of blood capillaries.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Glomerulus.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) They will only be able to breathe quietly. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\nA patient suffers a broken neck with damage to the spinal cord at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra. This damage to the spinal cord affects the function of the respiratory system. \n\nThe respiratory system is made up of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles. The diaphragm is responsible for the major part of breathing, while the intercostal muscles help with the smaller, more rapid breaths. Both of these muscles are innervated by the phrenic and intercostal nerves, which originate from the cervical segments of the spinal cord. \n\nSince the damage to the spinal cord is at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra, the nerves that control the diaphragm and intercostal muscles will also be affected. As a result, the patient will not be able to contract these muscles effectively, leading to a decrease in their breathing capacity, and ultimately, only being able to breathe quietly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) They will only be able to breathe quietly.",

Osteoblasts are responsible for the growth and maintenance of bone tissue, which is not related to the defense mechanism against bacteria.\n\nStep 3: Distinguish between the remaining choice. Mucous membranes are the answer. They are responsible for producing mucus, which traps bacteria and other foreign particles, preventing them from entering the body. Mucous membranes are lined with tiny, stabbing cells called cilia, which move the mucus and trapped particles out of the body. This process helps to keep the body free from infection and is an effective defense against environmental bacteria.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the function of the primary motor cortex and how it relates to the contraction of muscles.\n\nThe primary motor cortex is a region of the cerebral cortex responsible for planning, controlling, and executing voluntary movements of the body. It is located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe.\n\nWhen the primary motor cortex is activated, it sends signals to the spinal cord and motor neurons, which then transmit the signals to the muscles of the body. Depending on the specific muscles being activated, the contraction of the muscles can be either bilateral, ipsilateral or contralateral.\n\nBilateral contraction refers to the simultaneous contraction of both sides of a muscle, such as during most abdominal exercises.\n\nIpsilateral contraction refers to the contraction of a muscle on the same side of the body as the primary motor cortex, while contralateral contraction refers to the contraction of a muscle on the opposite side of the body.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Primary motor cortex activity results in which of the following:\n\n(A) bilateral contraction of antigravity limb muscles\n\nMuscles of the arms and legs that are responsible for moving the body and its limbs against gravity are called antigravity muscles. Since the primary motor cortex is located in the frontal lobe and its signals are transmitted through the spinal cord to the motor neurons and then to the muscles, bilateral contraction of antigravity limb muscles is not the correct answer.\n\n(B) bilateral contraction of limb musculature\n\nThis option would include both antigravity and gravity muscles. Since the primary motor cortex sends signals to both sides of the body, bilateral contraction of limb musculature is a possibility. This is the most likely answer.\n\n(C) contraction of ipsilateral limb musculature\n\nThis option would include the contraction of muscles on the same side of the body as the primary motor cortex. However, since the primary motor cortex is located in the frontal lobe, which is not specific to a particular side of the body, this option is not correct.\n\n(D) contraction of contralateral limb musculature\n\nThis option would include the contraction of muscles on the opposite side of the body as the primary motor cortex. However, since the primary motor cortex is located in the frontal lobe, which is not specific to a particular side of the body, this option is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) bilateral contraction of limb musculature.",
