            "model_answer": "To determine which principle is not an element of the responsibility to protect, we need to examine the core elements of the responsibility to protect. According to the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, the responsibility to protect consists of three elements: the responsibility to prevent, the responsibility to react, and the responsibility to rebuild. \n\nTherefore, to find the principle that is not an element of the responsibility to protect, we need to eliminate the options that are elements: \n\n- Option (A) - The responsibility to prevent - is an element of the responsibility to protect.\n- Option (B) - The responsibility to react - is an element of the responsibility to protect. \n\nNow, we just need to eliminate one more option: \n\n- Option (C) - The responsibility to remain sovereign - is also an element of the responsibility to protect. \n\nThus, the principle that is not an element of the responsibility to protect is:\n\n(D) The responsibility to rebuild.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

            "question": "Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\n\n(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated.\n(D) Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated.

Conversely, social constructivists regard this as an unhelpful regression to positivist binary frameworks of analysis.\n(C) Conventional constructivism refers to the earlier works of social constructivist theorists that are characterised by a rejection of positivist methodology.

Conversely, critical constructivists argue that this approach simply reproduces the binary distinctions that characterize positivist methodology.\n\nExplanation:\nConventional constructivists believe that constructivism can serve as a bridge between rationalist and reflectivist approaches, allowing them to benefit from the insights of each other. However, critical constructivists argue that this approach simply reproduces the binary distinctions that characterize positivist methodology.\n\nIn contrast, critical constructivism regards social constructivism as having the ability to bridge the rationalist and reflectivity approaches in a more effective manner than conventional constructivism. Social constructivists, on the other hand, believe that this approach still relies on positivist binary frameworks of analysis, which they reject.\n\nFinally, the option that suggests social constructivism is best understood as a uniform approach to the construction of social identities and security is not correct because it overlooks the distinctions within the field, which are an essential part of understanding the differences between conventional and critical social constructivism.",
