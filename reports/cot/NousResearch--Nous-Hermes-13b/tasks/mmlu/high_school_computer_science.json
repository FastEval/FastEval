            "model_answer": "To determine what x << 3 means in Python 3, we need to break it down and understand the operations involved. Here is the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. We are given x = 1, which is a variable representing a number. This means that x is initially equal to 1.\n\n2. We are then asked to determine the value of x << 3. To do this, we apply the left shift operator (<<) to x. The left shift operator shifts the bits of x to the left by 3 positions. In other words, it divides x by 2 to the power of 3.\n\n3. Since x is initially equal to 1, we can apply the left shift operator to it as follows:\n\n   x = 1\n   x = x << 3\n   x = 1 << 3\n\n   Applying the shift operator, we get:\n\n   x = 1 * (1/2)^3\n   x = 1 * (1/8)\n   x = 1/8\n\n   So, in Python 3, x << 3 would return the value 1/8. Therefore, the answer is (A) 1.",

Here's why:\n\nWhen a user enters a Web address in a browser, the browser sends a request to a Web server for the file or resource identified by the address. The Web server processes the request and sends the file to the user's browser.\n\nIn order to send the file over the Internet, it must be broken into small pieces called \"packets.\" These packets are then sent individually over the Internet to the user's computer, where they must be reassembled into the original file. This process is known as \"packet switching\" and is a fundamental principle of the Internet.\n\nTherefore, the answer that best describes how the file is sent to the user is (A) The file is broken into packets for transmission.
