            "model_answer": "In Python 3, the left shift operator (<<) is used to shift the bits to the left by a specified number of bits. When a number is shifted left, each bit is shifted left by one position, and any bits that shift off the right are discarded. For example, if we have the number 1 in binary, it is 00000001. If we shift it left by 3 bits, it becomes 00000011 (1 shifted left by 3 bits becomes 5 in decimal).\n\nSo, when x = 1, x << 3 results in 1 shifted left by 3 bits, which is 00000101 in binary. Converting this back to decimal gives us 5. Answer: (A) 1",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider what it means for a function to convert a string to an int in Python 3. In Python, strings are immutable, meaning they can't be changed once they're created. When we want to work with a string as though it were a numeric value, we need to convert it to an int or float. There are a few ways to do this, but for our purposes, we'll consider the built-in conversion functions in Python 3.\n\nThe first function in the list is:\n\n(A) int(x [,base])\n\nThis function takes a string 'x' and a base (optional) and converts the string to an int. It doesn't matter what the base is, since we're only concerned with converting strings to ints, we can omit the base argument. So, the function we're looking for is (A): int(x).",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is:\n\n(B) The file is broken into packets for transmission. The user's browser must request each packet in order until all packets are received.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen a user enters a Web address in a browser, a request for a file is sent to a Web server. The Web server then sends the requested file to the user's computer. The file is broken into smaller pieces called packets for transmission. These packets are then sent over the internet to the user's computer. The user's browser must request each packet in order until all packets are received. Once all the packets are received, the browser can reassemble them into the original file. This is option (B). Option (A) describes a different scenario where the packets do not need to be reassembled. Options (C) and (D) describe other scenarios that are not applicable to file transfer over the internet.",

A photographer is manipulating a digital image and overwriting the original image. Which of the following describes a lossless transformation of the digital image?\n\n(A) Compressing the image in a way that may lose information but will suffer only a small loss of image quality.\n(B) Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image. The new value of each pixel represents a shade of gray, ranging from white to black.\n(C) Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed.\n(D) Modifying part of the image by taking the pixels in one part of the picture and copying them to the pixels in another part of the picture.",

The reason for this answer is that lossless transformation retains all the information in the original image. In this case, the gray scale image is created by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel, which results in a new image with the same amount of information as the original image. The other options may result in loss of information, which is not lossless.",
