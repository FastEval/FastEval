            "model_answer": "1. Alzheimer's is a brain disease that affects memory, thinking, and behavior.  \n2. Risk factors for Alzheimer's include age, family history, genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors.  \n3. Alzheimer's is more common in people who are older, part of which can be attributed to increased age being a known risk factor.  \n4. Having a close relative with Alzheimer's, such as a parent, sibling, or child, increases the risk of developing the disease.  \n5. Other risk factors include a lower level of education, being married, not exercising, smoking, and having high blood pressure or heart disease.  \n6. Eating fish is not one of the classic risk factors for Alzheimer's. However, it is known that maintaining a healthy diet, including eating fish, can have many positive health effects.  \n7. A lower level of education is, in fact, a risk factor for Alzheimer's. There are many theories about why this is, but it is thought to be associated with lower cognitive reserve, socioeconomic factors, and health behaviors.  \n8. Being married is not a classic risk factor for Alzheimer's. However, marriage has been found to have positive effects on mental health, which may decreases the risk of developing Alzheimer's.  \n9. Therefore, none of the options are definitively associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's. However, factors such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and engaging in cognitively stimulating activities can all decrease the risk of developing Alzheimer's.",

However, option (D) stating that it fills with fluid is not a normal occurrence related to age. Instead, aging can cause the lens to become thicker (option A), yellower (option B), or clouded (option C). There may be fluid buildup in the eye due to other factors, but not in the lens itself.

Regular aerobic exercise is known to improve overall physical and mental health, which can contribute to improved cognitive function and reaction time. A study conducted by the National Institutes of Health showed that regular aerobic exercise can improve reaction time and cognitive function in older adults, leading to a reduction in the reaction time difference between younger and older adults.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C). The programmed theories of senescence, also known as the 'genome theory' or 'cellular theory', assert that senescence is a predetermined process that is built into the cellular machinery from the beginning. This means that aging is not solely caused by external factors, but rather by an internal program that governs the rate at which a cell wears out. Unlike programmed theories, unprogrammed theories of senescence attribute the onset of aging to various external factors, such as environmental stressors, oxidative damage, and inflammation. These theories suggest that aging is a passive process that occurs as a result of these factors, and that there is no predetermined plan or program that leads to senescence. Programmed theories, on the other hand, propose a more active process where aging is driven by an internal clock or set of instructions.",
