            "model_answer": "Step 1: \nTo find the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, we need to use the concept of supply and cost curves. Marginal revenue is the derivative of the revenue curve with respect to output, while marginal cost is the derivative of the cost curve with respect to output. \n\nStep 2: \nRecall that the total product is the product of the marginal product and the number of inputs, while the total product is the sum of the total product of all inputs. At the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, the marginal product of labor is equal to the average product of labor. \n\nStep 3: In other words, the marginal product of labor, MP, is equal to the average product of labor, AP, at the point where MR = MC. We can represent this as follows:\n\nMP = AP\n\nStep 4:\nNow, we need to find out which of the options given is true. Let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) Total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance:\nWe cannot determine the point where MR = MC by looking at the comparison between total revenue and total cost at their\ngreatest distance.\n\n(B) Total revenue is equal to total cost:\nThis option might seem to point to the solution because it involves the comparison between total revenue and total cost. However, it does not guarantee that MR = MC.\n\n(C) Marginal product is at its highest point:\nThis option is incorrect because the marginal product is the difference between the marginal revenue and marginal cost. It need not be equal to the average product of labor, which is the output.\n\n(D) Total product is at its highest point:\nThis option is incorrect because the total product is the product of the marginal product and the number of inputs. It does not guarantee that MR = MC.\n\nStep 5:\nTherefore, none of the options given correctly points to the condition where MR = MC. The correct option should be:\n\n(E) None of the above\n\nAnswer: (E)",

The marginal product of labor is clearly higher than the marginal product of capital, meaning that labor is more productive than capital in this scenario.\n\nSince labor is more productive, the firm should focus on increasing labor and decreasing capital.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "This question can be answered by analyzing the possible effects of an externality on market equilibrium. \n\nStep 1: An externality is an economic factor that is not reflected in the price of a good or service. This means that the market price may not accurately reflect the total cost or benefit of producing or consuming the good or service. \n\nStep 2: If there is an externality that causes the equilibrium price to be artificially high or artificially low, it means that the market price is not accurately reflecting the true cost or benefit of the good or service. This can lead to misallocation of resources and an inefficient use of society's scarce resources. \n\nStep 3: If an externality exists when markets cannot reach equilibrium, it means that the market is not able to adjust to the full impact of the externality, which can lead to an inefficient allocation of resources. \n\nStep 4: If an externality results in an equilibrium that does not maximize the total benefit to society, it means that the market is not able to achieve the highest level of total benefit that could be achieved if all costs and benefits were fully reflected in the market price. \n\nBased on these steps, we can determine that the answer to the question is (C) an externality exists when markets cannot reach equilibrium. This is because an externality can cause the equilibrium price to be artificially high or low, markets may not be able to reach equilibrium if an externality exists, and an externality can result in an equilibrium that does not maximize the total benefit to society.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of oligopoly and the nature of I = P \u00d7 A curve. In an oligopolistic market, there are a few large firms that produce similar but differentiated products. These firms follow the policy of price differentiation, which means they set their own prices rather than following a market price. The demand curve faced by an oligopolist is the same as the market demand curve, which is downward sloping.\n\nNow, let's consider the given scenario where rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase. In this situation, the market demand curve faces a decrease in price, which means it is negatively sloped.\n\n(A) Perfectly horizontal demand curve: This option suggests a demand curve that is not sloping up or down, which means it is horizontal. This is not the correct option because it contradicts the statement that the demand curve faces a price decrease.\n\n(B) Highly inelastic demand curve: This option suggests a demand curve that has a positive slope, which means it is relatively insensitive to a change in price. This could be the case if the product is a necessity or has an inelastic demand. However, it does not take into account the specific scenario of rival firms following a price decrease but not a price increase.\n\n(C) Highly elastic demand curve: This option suggests a demand curve that has a negative slope, which means it is very sensitive to a change in price. This could be the case if the product is a luxury or has an elastic demand. However, it does not take into account the specific scenario of rival firms following a price decrease but not a price increase.\n\n(D) A demand curve consisting of two discontinuous segments: This option suggests a demand curve that has two segments that are separated by a break, which means it is not a continuous curve. This could be the case if there is a sudden change in the market conditions that affects the demand. However, it does not take into account the specific scenario of rival firms following a price decrease but not a price increase.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct option is (B) Highly inelastic demand curve.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is A. \n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Patents can be used to protect intellectual property and create barriers to entry for competitors. This helps to maintain a firm's competitive advantage and can be a source of exclusive licenses that allow the firm to charge higher prices.\n2. Control of resources may include control over raw materials, distribution channels, or other assets that are necessary for producing a good or service. By controlling these resources, a firm can limit the number of competitors in the market and maintain its dominance.\n3. Economies of scale can also be a source of competitive advantage. As a firm increases its production capacity, it can reduce its costs per unit and therefore undercut the prices of its competitors.\n4. All of these factors can contribute to price discrimination, where a firm charges different prices for the same good or service to different groups of consumers. This is especially true for patents and exclusive licenses, which can be used to segment the market and charge higher prices to customers who are willing to pay for the privilege.\n5. Therefore, out of the given options, (A) all requirements for price discrimination is the correct answer.",

This means that the industry is not consuming a large portion of the total plastic produced. \n\nSince the industry is not consuming a large portion of the total plastic produced, it can be inferred that the cost of production remains relatively constant for the army-figures industry. This is because if the cost of production were to increase, the industry would need to consume more plastic to produce the same number of figures, and therefore would be a part of an increasing-cost industry.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the army-figures industry is most likely a constant-cost industry.",
