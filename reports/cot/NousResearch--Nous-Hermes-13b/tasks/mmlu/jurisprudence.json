            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) It demonstrates the difference between the internal and the external aspect of a rule. \n\nHart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation' is aimed at highlighting the difference between the internal and the external aspect of a rule. According to Hart, a rule is a rule only when it has both an external and internal aspect. The external aspect refers to the behavior that is required or prohibited by the rule, while the internal aspect refers to the person's psychological belief that they are bound to behave in that way. \n\nHart believes that a rule is only binding if it has both aspects, meaning that a person must both believe that they are obliged to follow the rule and also have an objective reason to be obliged to follow it. \n\nIn his book, 'The Concept of Law,' Hart uses this distinction to explain how law can be both internal and external at the same time, and how it can be separate from morality while still having moral elements.",

However, Maine's concept of status refers to the legal status that one holds in a society based on their position in a relationship with others. Therefore, when people interpret Maine's statement as a prediction that all societies will move from higher to lower social status, they misunderstand the concept of status and misrepresent it.",

            "model_answer": "The factor that contributed significantly to the revival of natural law in the 20th century is (C) The international recognition of human rights after World War II.\n\nThis is because after the devastation of World War II, there was a strong emphasis on establishing Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations in 1948. This laid the foundation for the recognition of human rights across the world. Consequently, the idea of natural law gained traction among philosophers and jurists as it provided a framework for the protection of these fundamental rights.",

            "model_answer": "The most compelling criticism of Llewellyn's distinction between the grand and formal styles of legal reasoning is (C) it is misleading to pigeon-hole judges in this way.\n\nExplanation:\nLlewellyn's distinction between the grand and formal styles of legal reasoning was an attempt to categorize different approaches to judicial decision-making. However, this categorization has come under fire from legal scholars who argue that it is too simplistic and unfair to pigeon-hole judges into two distinct categories.\n\nCriticism (A) suggests that there is no distinction between the two forms of legal reasoning, which challenges the validity of Llewellyn's categorization.\n\nCriticism (B) argues that judges are appointed to interpret the law, not to make it, which implies that judicial reasoning should focus on applying the law rather than making new law.\n\nCriticism (D) suggests that judicial reasoning is always formal, which implies that all judges follow the same rules and processes in their decision-making. However, this is not necessarily the case, as judges may use different approaches depending on the circumstances of a particular case.\n\nWhile all of these criticisms are important to consider, the most compelling argument is that pigeon-holing judges into two distinct categories is misleading and unfair. Judicial reasoning is a complex process that involves a variety of factors, and it is Unreasonable to assume that all judges can be categorized into two groups. Therefore, criticism (C) is the most compelling.",
