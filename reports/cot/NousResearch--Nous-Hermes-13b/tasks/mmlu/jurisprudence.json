He argues that a rule is internal if a person is obliged to act in a certain way because they recognize the rule, while a rule is external if a person is obliged to act in a certain way because they are subject to the rule regardless of whether they acknowledge it. This distinction helps to clarify the concept of law, distinguishing it from other forms of social order or cooperation.",

            "question": "Which of the following factors contributed significantly to the revival of natural law in the 20th century?\n\n(A) Depression of the 1930\n(B) The rise of Fascism\n(C) The international recognition of human rights after World War II\n(D) The Bolshevik Revolution",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine which factor contributed significantly to the revival of natural law in the 20th century, we need to analyze the historical context and how each option relates to it. \n\n(A) Depression of the 1930s - The Great Depression was a global economic crisis that lasted from 1929 to 1939. While this event may have contributed to the development of economic thought and theories, it is not directly related to the revival of natural law. \n\n(B) The rise of Fascism - Fascism was a political ideology and system of governance that emerged in Italy in the early 20th century, characterized by authoritarianism, nationalism, and dictatorial power. The rise of Fascism can be seen as a reaction against the liberal democracy that dominated Europe before World War I. However, the revival of natural law was more a reaction against the moral relativism and nihilism that arose in the aftermath of World War I and the Russian Revolution. Therefore, the rise of Fascism can be considered a contributing factor to the revival of natural law, but it is not the sole or most significant factor.\n\n(C) The international recognition of human rights after World War II - After the horrors of World War II, there was a renewed focus on human rights and the need to promote equality and justice. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, was a major milestone in the development of international law and the protection of human rights. The revival of natural law in the 20th century can be seen as a response to this recognition of human rights, and a rejection of the moral relativism that had dominated earlier periods. Therefore, this factor played a significant role in the revival of natural law.\n\n(D) The Bolshevik Revolution - The Bolshevik Revolution, which took place in Russia in 1917, led to the establishment of the Soviet Union and the rise of Communism. This event challenged the traditional understanding of rights and liberties, and contributed to the emergence of moral relativism and nihilism. While the Bolshevik Revolution may have contributed to the moral and political climate that led to the revival of natural law, it is not the most significant factor.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the most significant factor contributing to the revival of natural law in the 20th century is the international recognition of human rights after World War II.",

            "model_answer": "The most compelling criticism of Llewellyn's distinction between the grand and formal styles of legal reasoning is (D) Judicial reasoning is always formal.\n\nExplanation:\nLlewellyn's distinction between the grand and formal styles of legal reasoning is based on the idea that some judges engage in creative, broad reasoning while others follow strict, narrow rules. However, this criticism argues that the distinction is misleading because all judicial reasoning is actually formal and follows set legal rules. This means that there is no difference between the two styles of legal reasoning, and the distinction is not a useful way to analyze judicial decision-making.",

Social primary goods such as wealth, power, and protection of the disabled are important, but they are not the central focus of Rawls's theory.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first examine Austin's argument about the concept of a command. Austin's argument states that a sanction consists of the smallest chance of incurring the smallest evil. This means that for something to be considered a command, it must have some sort of sanction that follows for disobedience.\n\nBased on this argument, the statement that is least likely to follow logically is (D) A command confers power to change one's legal status. This statement does not have any direct relation to Austin's argument about the concept of a command and sanction. It is more focused on the power that comes with a command, rather than the consequences of disobeying it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) A command confers power to change one's legal status.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The 'England problem' refers to the issue of why England, and not other European countries, developed into a capitalist society. This question became an important topic of research in sociology, particularly for Max Weber.\n\nTo solve this problem, Weber approached it from a historical perspective, analyzing the social and economic conditions that existed in England during the 16th and 17th centuries. He recognized the importance of certain features of the English legal system that facilitated the development of capitalism, such as the existence of a legal mechanism for the enforcement of contracts, and the protection of property rights. This legal framework created an environment in which economic transactions could take place with a level of security and certainty, allowing for the development of commercial activity and trade.\n\nAdditionally, Weber argued that the legitimate domination of the state was crucial in allowing for the development of capitalism. In England, the state was seen as a neutral arbiter of disputes, rather than as a partner in economic activity. This perception allowed for the creation of a stable and predictable environment in which business could flourish.\n\nBased on these factors, Weber's solution to the 'England problem' involves recognizing the importance of certain legal and political institutions that facilitated the development of capitalism, as well as the legitimate domination of the state.
