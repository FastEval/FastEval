            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what a Robertsonian translocation is and what happens during it. Robertsonian translocations occur when pieces of one chromosome break off and attach to another chromosome. The most common type of Robertsonian translocation occurs when a piece from chromosome 13 attaches to chromosome 14. In this case, the chromosomes are not lost or gained, but instead, two chromosomes become fused into one.\n\nSo, according to the information given, fusion occurs at the ends of the long arms of the chromosomes involved in the Robertsonian translocation. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) ends of the long arms.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To find the expected frequency of affected females, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium equation: p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, where p and q represent the frequency of the dominant and recessive alleles, respectively. In this case, p = q (as the condition is X-linked recessive) so the equation simplifies to p^2 = 1 - q^2.\nWe know that the frequency of affected males (homozygous recessive) is 0.10, so q^2 = 0.10. To find q, we take the square root of 0.10, which is 0.1051. This is the frequency of the affected females. Therefore, the expected frequency of affected females is: \n\n(A) 0.01",

The two strands of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs. Adenine (A) will pair with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) will pair with guanine (G) due to their differences in the sugar-phosphate backbone.\n3. So, the answer is (A) cytosine.",

            "model_answer": "In order to determine the pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia), we need to consider the possible genetic scenarios. \n\nMalignant hyperthermia is a autosomal dominant disorder. This is because:\n\n1. It is not sex linked: Unlike conditions such as hemophilia, where genetic inheritance is determined by the X or Y chromosome, malignant hyperthermia arises from mutations in the genes located on autosomes.\n2. Only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to express the disease: Since the disease is dominant, only one copy of the mutated gene needs to be inherited for the individual to be affected by the disorder. A carrier of the mutated gene and an unaffected individual who inherits one normal copy from each parent may still be affected by the disorder.\n3. It follows Mendelian inheritance: Just like any other autosomal dominant condition, malignant hyperthermia follows the Mendelian pattern of inheritance, where the risk of passing the disorder to offspring is 50%.\n\nTherefore, the pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is:\n\n(A) autosomal dominant.",

It refers to a specific aspect of sex chromosome mapping, which is not applicable to the broader context of human chromosome mapping.\n\n(B) proceeded much more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available: This statement is consistent with the general understanding of how human chromosome mapping has progressed. As more DNA markers became available, it became easier to map chromosomes and determine their relationships to each other.\n\n(C) has determined that the number of linkage groups is about twice the number of chromosomes: This statement is also consistent with the general understanding of how human chromosome mapping has progressed. Early mapping efforts identified linkage groups, which are regions of the chromosome that are physically linked and appear to be inherited together. As mapping progressed, it was discovered that there were fewer linkage groups than chromosomes, leading to the current understanding that there are about twice as many linkage groups as chromosomes.\n\n(D) has demonstrated that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes: This statement is not consistent with the general understanding of human chromosome mapping. While it is true that most of the DNA in our genome does code for genes, chromosome mapping has also identified non-coding DNA regions that do not code for genes but play important roles in regulating gene expression and other cellular processes.\n\nBased on the analysis of each option, the correct answer is (B) proceeded much more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available.",

This is because the letter codes Asp and Phe are commonly used to represent aspartic acid and phenylalanine, respectively, in molecular biology and protein chemistry. If a reference states that a specific amino acid has been replaced by another, it typically means that the first amino acid has been replaced by the second one. In this case, the report states that Asp235 has been replaced by Phe. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) asparagine has been replaced by phenylalanine.",

Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder where the body cannot break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. If left untreated, PKU can lead to brain damage and intellectual disability in the child.\n\nSecondly, we need to know the risk of having a child with PKU from a mother who has untreated PKU. This would involve knowledge of the carrier frequency and the mechanism of inheritance of PKU. \n\nThirdly, we would need to compare the risk of having a child with PKU to the risk of having a child without any disabilities.\n\nBased on the information available, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria would likely be quite high. Without having all the necessary information, it would be impossible to provide an exact percentage.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to determine which type of mutation is associated with exon skipping. \n\nFirst, let's define what exon skipping is. Exon skipping is a process where a portion of the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from a gene is spliced out, or \"skipped,\" during the process of mRNA processing. This results in a truncated or mis-sized protein that can lead to various genetic disorders.\n\nNow, let's examine each type of mutation and determine which one is associated with exon skipping:\n\n- (A) Nonsense mutations: These are point mutations that occur within a coding region of the gene and create a premature stop codon. When translated into a protein, this will result in a truncated protein that is often non-functional or has a reduced function. Exon skipping is not typically associated with nonsense mutations.\n\n- (B) Regulatory mutations: These mutations occur in non-coding regions of the gene and can affect gene expression, including splicing. However, the primary focus of regulatory mutations is on the regulation of gene transcription and translation, rather than the splicing process itself. While these mutations could potentially affect splicing, they are not directly associated with exon skipping.\n\n- (C) RNA processing mutations: These mutations directly affect the splicing process itself or other RNA processing events such as capping, splicing, and polyadenylation. Specific mutations in genes encoding splicing factors or other RNA processing proteins can lead to aberrant splicing, including exon skipping. Therefore, RNA processing mutations are associated with exon skipping.\n\n- (D) Silent mutations: These mutations occur in non-coding regions of the gene and do not change the amino acid sequence of the protein. Silent mutations are not associated with exon skipping as they do not affect the protein-coding region of the gene.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is (C) RNA processing mutations.",
