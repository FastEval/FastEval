            "model_answer": "First, we need to pay attention to the equation 24 = 2p. This equation is set equal to each other, which means that the value of p on the left side should be equal to the value of p on the right side. \n\nSince both sides of the equation contain p, the value of p must be the same on both sides. In other words, we need to find a value that makes both sides of the equation equal. \n\nTherefore, the value of p must be a number that divides evenly into 24. \n\nThe factors of 24 are: \n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \n\nOut of these factors, the only one that matches the value of p is 2. So, the value of p in the equation 24 = 2p is 2. \n\n(A) p = 4 (B) p = 8 (C) p = 12 (D) p = 24",
