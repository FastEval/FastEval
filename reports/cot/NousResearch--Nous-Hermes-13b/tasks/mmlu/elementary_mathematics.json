This gives us:\n\n2*(24) = 2p\n48 = 2p\n\nNow we can simplify the left side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by 2.

Since we can't purchase a fraction of a soccer ball, we'll Round Up to the nearest whole number: 6 soccer balls\n3. To determine if it is possible to purchase more soccer balls, recalculate the budget with the same number of soccer balls:\n   $90.00 / 6 = $15.00\n   Subtract the cost of one soccer ball from the budget: $15.00 - $15.60 = -$0.60\n   Since the result is negative, it means that the team cannot purchase more soccer balls with the given budget.",
