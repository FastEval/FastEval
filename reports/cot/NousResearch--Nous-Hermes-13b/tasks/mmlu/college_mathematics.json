This means that all the coefficients of the polynomials in P are integers modulo 5, and the degree of each polynomial is at most 7.\n\nNow, let's consider the differentiation operator D, which sends each polynomial p(x) in P to its derivative p'(x). The derivative of a polynomial is also a polynomial, and its degree is one less than the degree of the original polynomial. Therefore, the degree of the derivative polynomial p'(x) will be at most 7 - 1 = 6.\n\nSince the degree of p'(x) is at most 6, all polynomials in the range r of D will have degrees less than or equal to 6. In general, the range of a differential operator is always a subset of theNull(D), which means that the dimension of the range r of D will be less than or equal to thedimension of the null space n of D.\n\nNow, let's determine the dimensions of the null space n and range r of D.\n\nThe null space n of D is the set of polynomials p(x) such that D(p(x)) = 0. Since D sends p(x) to its derivative p'(x), the null space n consists of the constant polynomials. Therefore, the dimension of the null space n is 1, as there is only one linearly independent constant polynomial in each degree.\n\nThe range r of D consists of all polynomials in P whose derivatives are also in P. Since the degree of these derivatives is at most 6, the range r consists of all polynomials in P with degrees less than or equal to 6. However, we already know that the null space n consists of the constant polynomials, which are precisely the polynomials with degrees equal to 0. This means that the dimension of the range r of D is 6, as there are 6 linearly independent polynomials in each degree from 1 to 6.\n\nIn summary, the dimensions of the null space n and range r of D are:\n\nn = 1\nr = 6",
