            "question": "Which of the following methods of detecting breast cancer involves exposure to radiation?\n\n(A) Needle aspiration\n(B) Mammography\n(C) Mastectomy\n(D) Lumpectomy",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what methods of detecting breast cancer are available. Then, we can determine which of these methods involves exposure to radiation.\n\nMethods of detecting breast cancer include:\n1. Mammography\n2. Ultrasound\n3. MRI\n4. Biopsy (needle aspiration, mammotome, core, excisional, etc.)\n5. Lumpectomy\n6. Mastectomy\n\nNow, let's look at the given options and determine which one involves exposure to radiation.\n\n(A) Needle aspiration - This method involves using a needle to remove a sample of tissue from the breast, which is then examined for cancerous cells. It does not involve exposure to radiation.\n\n(B) Mammography - This method involves using X-rays to create an image of the breast tissue. While mammography does not involve direct exposure to radiation, it does involve exposure to ionizing radiation, which can potentially increase the risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n(C) Mastectomy - This method involves surgically removing the entire breast to treat or prevent breast cancer. It does not involve exposure to radiation.\n\n(D) Lumpectomy - This method involves surgically removing a portion of the breast tissue to treat or prevent breast cancer. It does not involve exposure to radiation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Mammography.",

            "question": "You are a homosexual male: Last night, you were tempted by lusty, swarthy Jacques (the king of fraternity row) to join him at the local dairy bar for a tall cool glass of milk. You also briefly considered studying for this test, but Jacques won out. In Freudian terms, which of the following was dominant?\n\n(A) the id\n(B) the ego\n(C) the superego\n(D) the Oedipus complex",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: We know that the person is a homosexual male who was tempted by Jacques to join him at the dairy bar instead of studying for the test. \n\nStep 2: We also know that Freud identified three parts of the mind - the id, the ego, and the superego. The id is the primitive and instinctual part of the mind, the ego is the rational and conscious part of the mind, and the superego is the internalized conscience. \n\nStep 3: The Oedipus complex refers to a psychological theory which states that there is a period in a child's development during which they have a desire for their opposite-sex parent and jealousy towards their same-sex parent, particularly during the stages of sexual development. \n\nStep 4: Since the person is a homosexual male, he would not experience the Oedipus complex in the traditional sense, as he does not have opposite-sex parents. \n\nStep 5: Therefore, the id, ego, and superego are the possible options to consider. \n\nStep 6: In this specific situation, the person was tempted by Jacques and gave in to his desires. Therefore, the id was dominant in this situation. \n\nConclusion: The answer is (A) the id.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The reasoning behind sociobiologists believing that there are more males than females with paraphilias is as follows:\n\n(A) paraphilias guarantee survival of the species - This statement is not true as paraphilias are typically viewed as deviant behavior and can lead to problems in social situations or relationships.\n\n(B) evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli - This statement is true as evolutionarily, males are typically more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior, including sexual behavior, in order to maximize their chances of reproducing. As a result, males may have a higher prevalence of paraphilias as they are more likely to seek out novel sexual stimuli.\n\n(C) of left brain/right brain differences between the genders - This statement is not relevant to the discussion of paraphilias as it deals with the function of the brain rather than the prevalence of paraphilias.\n\n(D) male brains are better developed than are female brains - This statement is true as the typical male brain is larger and has a higher concentration of testosterone, which can contribute to a higher prevalence of paraphilias.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.",

            "question": "Joe wants desperately to get close to Helen. Helen appears to be put off by Joe's desperate advances. This is typical of Joe's relationships with women. According to attachment theory Joe would best be described as:\n\n(A) a secure lover\n(B) an avoidant lover\n(C) an anxious-ambivalent lover\n(D) a passionate lover",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, Joe appears to be exhibiting anxious-ambivalent behavior. \n\nThis answer is derived from attachment theory, which posits that individuals have one of three main attachment styles: secure, avoidant, or anxious-ambivalent. According to this theory, individuals with an anxious-ambivalent attachment style often feel a fear of abandonment and have difficulty with trust and intimacy. They may come across as desperate or needy in their relationships, and their partners may perceive them as overbearing or insincere.\n\nIn the given scenario, Joe appears to be acting desperately in an attempt to get close to Helen, which could be seen as a sign of insecurity and anxiety about losing her. Additionally, Helen's disinterest in Joe's advances suggests that she may feel overwhelmed or smothered by his behavior, which is consistent with an anxious-ambivalent attachment style. \n\nTherefore, the best answer choice that describes Joe's relationship behavior based on attachment theory is (B) an anxious-ambivalent lover.",
