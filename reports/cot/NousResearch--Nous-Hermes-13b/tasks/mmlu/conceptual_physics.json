Therefore, options (A) and (B) can be eliminated since the beam of light does not pass through the surface. \n\nThe angle of refraction is 20\u00b0 from the normal. We know that the refractive index of water increases with depth, so we can calculate the angle of refraction of the light as it enters the water.\n\nUsing Snell's Law, n1 * sin(\u03b81) = n2 * sin(\u03b82), where n1 is the refractive index of air (approximately 1) and n2 is the refractive index of water at the given angle, we can calculate the angle of refraction of the light as it enters the water.\n\n20\u00b0 < sin(\u03b82) < 56.31\u00b0 (using the range of the refractive index of water, 1.33 - 1.36)\n\u03b82 \u2248 56.31\u00b0\n\nSince the angle of refraction of the light entering the water is equal to the angle of incidence, \n\n20\u00b0 = 56.31\u00b0\n\nThis is not possible, as the angle of incidence cannot be greater than the angle of refraction.\n\nTherefore, the beam of light is absorbed by the water, and the answer is (C).",

This is because Euclidean geometry is based on three dimensions and follows the Pythagorean theorem for triangles. \n\nHowever, four-dimensional geometry is based on four dimensions, and the rules for calculating angles and other measurements are different. In four-dimensional geometry, the angles of a triangle can add up to 180\u00b0 or more or less, depending on the specific shape of the triangle. \n\nSo, in four-dimensional geometry, the statement that the angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0 is not always true, but rather, it is sometimes true.

This change in magnetic field can occur when the magnetic field aligns with the electric field, which is the point at which the bidirectional nature of the electric and magnetic fields allows energy to be transferred between them. This alignment is also known as \"fair weather\" or \"quiet\" conditions. \n\nAlternatively, if the magnetic field is at right angles to the electric field, no transfer of energy can occur because the fields are working against each other. Additionally, the conversion of magnetic energy to another form of energy, such as heat, is not the same as inducing a voltage in a wire loop. Therefore, (B) aligns with the electric field is the correct answer.",

The idea is to step up voltage while ste stepping down the current using Ohm's Law: V = I * R, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.\n4.

The frequency of a wave relates to the number of oscillations or cycles completed by the wave in one second.
