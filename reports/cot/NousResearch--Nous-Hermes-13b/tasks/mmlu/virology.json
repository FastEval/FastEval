            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is D) All of the above. \n\nAIDS activism played a crucial role in bringing attention to the severity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the U.S. and around the world. As a result, many reforms were implemented in various areas, including but not limited to:\n\n1. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reforms: Activists pushed for faster approval of drugs for life-threatening illnesses like HIV, leading to changes in the way the FDA reviewed and approved new drugs.\n\n2. Easier access to investigational drugs: Before the AIDS epidemic, access to experimental drugs was limited to only a few people. AIDS activism changed that regime, leading to more widespread access to experimental drugs for people with HIV.\n\n3. Changes in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S.: Activists pushed for changes in how people with HIV were treated, leading to more compassionate care and better medical practices. Additionally, the AIDS epidemic led to advancements in research and the development of new drugs and treatments.\n\nTherefore, AIDS activism in the U.S. resulted in all of these changes:\n\n-(A) Food and Drug Administration reforms\n-(B) Easier access to investigational drugs\n-(C) Changes in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S.\n\nSo the answer is (D) All of the above.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the most causes of death globally, we need to consider various factors such as age, location, and available medical resources. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2020, the top ten causes of death globally (in order) are: \n\n1. Non-communicable diseases (e.g. heart disease, cancer, diabetes)\n2. Injuries and accidents\n3. Communicable diseases (e.g. tuberculosis, malaria, HIV/AIDS)\n4. Neonatal conditions (e.g. preterm birth, congenital abnormalities)\n5. Maternal disorders\n6. Respiratory infections \n7. Diarrheal diseases\n8. Nutritional deficiencies\n9. Chronic kidney disease\n10. Central nervous system disorders\n\nBased on this information, we can see that respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases are two of the leading causes of death globally. However, without more detailed information, it is impossible to determine which of the two causes more deaths.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) This period commonly lasts for a few days.\n\nThe incubation period is the time between an individual's exposure to a virus and the onset of symptoms. During this time, the virus is moving through the body and multiplying, but the person may not yet show any signs of illness. This period commonly lasts for a few days, but it can vary depending on the specific virus and the person's immune system. The immune system is actively fighting the virus during this time, but they are not yet able to clear it from the body. Although the virus is replicating, it has not yet reached a high enough level to cause symptoms.",

The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life for all infants, regardless of their country of residence or their mother's educational level. Evidence supports that exclusive breastfeeding not only provides the optimal nutrition for infants in these settings but also helps protect them against waterborne and other illnesses. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is (B) Exclusively breast fed for six months.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) Innovators. \n\nReasoning: \n- Change in a community usually starts with a small group of people who are willing to try new ideas and take risks. \n- These people are often referred to as innovators, as they are the ones who are introducing new ideas and concepts to the community. \n- These innovators are typically ahead of the curve and are willing to take risks in order to bring about change. \n- Once the innovators have successfully demonstrated the value of a new idea or concept, it begins to spread to others in the community. \n- As more and more people in the community begin to adopt the new idea or concept, it begins to spread further and further until it becomes widespread and accepted by the majority of the community. \n- This process is often represented by the technology adoption lifecycle, which shows how innovators, early adapters, middle adapters, and late adapters all contribute to the eventual widespread acceptance and adoption of a new idea or technology. \n- Therefore, in order to effectively bring about change in a community, it is often necessary to start with the innovators and work to build support and momentum from there.",

In the context of drugs and alcohol, contingency management can be used to incentivize drug users to engage in pro-social behaviors, such as using condoms.

            "model_answer": "The most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is (D) Clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells.\n\nExplanation:\nThe adaptive immune system is special because it can recognize specific pathogens and remember them so that it can respond faster and more effectively in the future. This is known as adaptive immunity. The key players in this system are T cells and B cells, which are part of the lymphatic system.\n\nClonal expansion is a process where one of the T or B cells recognizes a specific antigen (a part of a pathogen) and prompts the proliferation of that specific cell to produce many identical B or T cells, each equipped to recognize the same antigen. This allows the immune system to mount a targeted response against the pathogen.\n\nWhile all the options listed are important characteristics of the adaptive immune system, clonal expansion is unique to it and is the most special feature that sets it apart from the innate immune system.",
