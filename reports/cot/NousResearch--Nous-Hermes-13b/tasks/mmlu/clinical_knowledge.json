            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the size of cannula to use in a patient who needs a rapid blood transfusion, we need to consider several factors. The size of the cannula is typically measured by the gauge, which is a circular diameter. Therefore, we need to determine the gauge that will allow a smooth and efficient blood flow during the transfusion.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, it is essential to use the smallest gauge possible that will still allow for the efficient transfusion of blood. Larger gauges are associated with a higher risk of complications, such as blood loss or infection.\n\nAs of 2020 medical knowledge, the most commonly used cannula size for rapid blood transfusion is 18 gauge. This is based on the assumption that 18 gauge is small enough to minimize the risk of complications while still allowing for an efficient blood flow. In some cases, a 20 gauge cannula may be used if the patient's veins are particularly small or difficult to access. However, 22 and 24 gauge cannulas are generally not recommended for rapid blood transfusion because they are too small and may cause complications.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The key attribute in successful marathon running is stamina. This is because stamina refers to the ability to maintain an effort over an extended period of time, which is crucial in a marathon race. While strength, power, and stride length may also play a role in running, they are not as important as stamina in completing a marathon. Other attributes like speed and agility may also be beneficial, but they are not as critical as stamina. Therefore, stamina is the most important attribute for successful marathon running.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what anaphylaxis is and the common symptoms associated with it. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs when the immune system overreacts to a foreign substance. Common symptoms of anaphylaxis include difficulty breathing, hives, itching, swelling of the face and throat, low blood pressure, and dizziness. \n\nNow, let's examine the given options:\n\n(A) Stridor: Stridor is the abnormal, high-pitched sound produced when air flows in and out of the throat. It can be a symptom of anaphylaxis, but it is not the only symptom.\n\n(B) Bradycardia: Bradycardia is a slow heartbeat, usually less than 60 beats per minute. It can be a symptom of anaphylaxis, but it is not the only symptom.\n\n(C) Severe wheeze: Wheezing is a high-pitched sound produced when breathing out. It can be a symptom of anaphylaxis, but it is not the only symptom.\n\n(D) Rash: A rash is a change in the skin's color or texture. It can be a symptom of anaphylaxis, but it is not the only symptom.\n\nSo, among these options, the one that is not a symptom of anaphylaxis is (A) Stridor. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

Closed pouches are used to collect liquid or semi-formed output while allowing the patient to continue their daily activities without worrying about leaks or spills.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the role of anaerobic and aerobic metabolism during sprinting.\n\nAnaerobic metabolism is the process of generating energy without the use of oxygen. In contrast, aerobic metabolism involves using oxygen to generate energy through a series of metabolic pathways.\n\nDuring a single sprint, both anaerobic and aerobic metabolism contribute to the energy demand. However, as the number of sprints increases, the duration of exercise decreases, which means that there is less time for recovery between sprints. In this scenario, the contribution of anaerobic metabolism progressively increases, while the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism decreases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) the anaerobic contribution progressively increases.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: We know that diplopia is the condition where a patient sees double. In order to determine which statement is true, we need to look at the possible causes of diplopia. These include cranial nerve palsies, ocular misalignment, and other conditions that affect binocular vision.\n\nStep 2: We can eliminate statements (A) and (D) because they are false in the context of diplopia. Covering one eye will not necessarily prevent diplopia, and a seventh nerve palsy does not cause a divergent squint.\n\nStep 3: We can also eliminate statement (C) because a fourth nerve palsy is caused by a lesion of the lower cranial nerve, which controls the lateral rectus muscle. When the patient looks upwards, the lateral rectus muscle contracts causing the eye to turn inwards, which is not true in diplopia.\n\nTherefore, the only true statement is (B) - The outer image is always the false image. In diplopia, the outer image is the false image because the light enters the eye from different angles, causing the images to be fused at a different point on the retina than they would be in a single eye.",

They determine which amino acid is to be added next during translation, the process by which the genetic information from genes is copied into an amino acid sequence in a protein. In other words, codons are the \"UUN codon\" of the language of proteins.\n\nIn RNA, codons are composed of nucleotide bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U), linked together by an RNA backbone. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or a stop signal. In DNA, codons are also composed of nucleotide bases, but with thymine (T) instead of uracil (U). Despite this difference, the principle remains the same: codons serve as a genetic code to direct the synthesis of proteins.",
