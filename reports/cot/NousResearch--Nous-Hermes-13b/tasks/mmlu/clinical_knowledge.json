            "model_answer": "In selecting the proper gauge of cannula for a rapid blood transfusion, there are a few factors to consider, including the size and condition of the patient's veins, the amount of blood to be transfused, and the speed at which the transfusion is to take place.\n\n(A) 18 gauge is typically used for larger adult patients or when placing a central line. \n(B) 20 gauge is a common size used for most adult patients, \n(C) 22 gauge is typically used for smaller adults, children or infants, and \n(D) 24 gauge is used when a smaller size is needed, such as in very small children or newborns.\n\nTaking into account the need for a rapid blood transfusion, a practitioner would likely opt for the smallest gauge possible to minimize any additional trauma to the patient's vein. Therefore, the appropriate size of cannula in this instance would be (A) 18 gauge. Answer: A",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The key attribute in successful marathon running is (D) stamina.\n\nReasoning:\nStamina is the ability to maintain prolonged physical or mental effort. In marathon running, which is a long-distance event, it is essential to have the stamina to maintain a consistent pace for the entire race. A runner without stamina may exhaust quickly, leading to a slower overall time. Strength, power, and stride length are important attributes as well, but they play complementary roles to stamina in determining the success of a marathon runner. Therefore, stamina is the most crucial attribute for successful marathon running.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which symptom is not a symptom of anaphylaxis, we need to look at the typical symptoms of anaphylaxis. \n\nAnaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that affects multiple systems of the body. Typical symptoms include: \n\n1. Hives or itching (this can be more common in adults rather than children)\n2. Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath\n3. Weak or rapid pulse\n4. Dizziness, fainting, or loss of consciousness\n5. Vomiting, bloating, or cramps\n6. Severe wheeze\n7. Shock, collapse, or loss of responsiveness\n\nNow let's compare these symptoms with the options given:\n\n(A) Stridor: This is not a symptom of anaphylaxis. It refers to a high-pitched sound produced during respiration due to narrowing of the upper airway. \n\n(B) Bradycardia: This is not a symptom of anaphylaxis either. It refers to a slow heart rate.\n\n(C) Severe wheeze: This is a symptom of anaphylaxis. It refers to a high-pitched sound produced during respiration due to narrowing of the upper airway.\n\n(D) Rash: This is also a symptom of anaphylaxis. It refers to a red, itchy, raised rash that appears on the skin.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Stridor.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) The patient has a semi-formed or liquid output. \n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\nClosed pouches are typically applied to individuals with colostomies, ileostomies, or urostomies. These surgeries create a kind of \"pouch\" or opening in the abdomen to allow for the collection of waste or urine. So, option (B) and (D) can be eliminated because they both relate to specific kinds of pouches which are not semi-formed or liquid output.\n\nOption (C) refers to the immediate post-operative period but it does not mention specifically the kind of pouch or output. So, we can eliminate this option as well.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A) The patient has a semi-formed or liquid output which is used to describe individuals who have ostomy bags to collect waste material that cannot be controlled, such as diarrhea, or liquid outputs like mucous or other bodily fluids.",

When the number of sprints increases, the intensity of the exercise also increases. \n\n2. As the intensity of the exercise increases, the demand for energy also increases. \n\n3. At high intensities, the aerobic system can't provide enough energy to meet the demands of the muscles, so the anaerobic system is called upon to contribute more. \n\n4. The aerobic system can only provide a limited amount of energy, so as the anaerobic contribution progressively increases, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism also increases. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.",

This option is not entirely accurate.\n\nStep 4: For option C, a fourth nerve palsy refers to a paralysis of the upper eye muscles, causing failure of elevation. This can occur when looking upwards, but it is not always the case.\n\nStep 5: For option D, a sixth nerve palsy refers to a paralysis of the lateral eye muscles, causing a squint. This option is correct as a sixth nerve palsy can cause a divergent squint where the eyes point in different directions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option D: A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint.",

The goal of sodium bicarbonate ingestion is to improve the efficiency of the energy system in muscle, which is achieved by altering the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid. \n5.

Fatty acids are organic molecules, typically long-chained, which are derived from fats and oils.\n2. They are hydrophobic, meaning they do not dissolve well in water.\n3. The main function of fatty acids in cellular metabolism is to be broken down and generate energy through a process called beta-oxidation.\n4. This process occurs in the mitochondria, which are the cellular organelles responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate).\n5. During beta-oxidation, fatty acids are first activated by being attached to a molecule called coenzyme A (CoA). This attachment is necessary for the fatty acid to enter the mitochondria.\n6. Therefore, fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria bound to coenzyme A (CoA).",
