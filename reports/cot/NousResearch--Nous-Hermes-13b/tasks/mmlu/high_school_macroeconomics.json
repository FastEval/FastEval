            "question": "Suppose that an expansionary fiscal policy leads to a large increase in real output and a small increase in the price level. From this it can be inferred that\n\n(A) inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus.\n(B) the economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n(C) aggregate supply decreased.\n(D) aggregate demand is steeply sloped.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "My reasoning is as follows:\n\nAn expansionary fiscal policy is one that involves increasing government spending or cutting taxes to stimulate economic growth. When this happens, we would expect to see an increase in real output (because more money is being pumped into the economy) and an increase in employment (because more resources are being utilized). This leads to a decrease in unemployment.\n\nHowever, if the increase in real output is only large and the increase in the price level is only small, this means that the increase in demand is not being met with a proportional increase in supply. This is because the increase in demand has not been sufficient to cause significant input shortages or reduce the quantity of goods available for sale.\n\nTherefore, it can be inferred that aggregate demand is steeply sloped.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is B. Tariffs and quotas are trade barriers that countries use to restrict the flow of goods across their borders. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, while quotas limit the amount of a product that can be imported. \n\nTariffs and quotas can sometimes raise and sometimes lower the amount of the product sold domestically. Tariffs increase the price of imported goods, which makes them less competitive with domestically produced goods. This can result in higher prices for domestically produced goods as well, which could lead to a decrease in the amount of the product sold domestically. On the other hand, quotas can sometimes increase the amount of the product sold domestically, as consumers may have no choice but to buy domestically produced goods if they are unable to find imported goods. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) sometimes raise and sometimes lower the amount of the product sold domestically.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) expansionary monetary policy. \n\nWhen bond prices fall, it means that the yield (interest rate) on those bonds rises. This occurs because investors are demanding higher returns for taking on the bond's risk. \n\nAn expansionary monetary policy is one that is designed to increase demand and stimulate economic growth. This is typically done by lowering interest rates, making borrowing cheaper and increasing the money supply. \n\nWhen the central bank implements an expansionary monetary policy, it can lead to inflationary pressures. Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money over time, which means that the value of bonds (which are denominated in future cash flows) is diminished. \n\nTo compensate for the potential erosion of their future cash flows, bond issuers must pay higher interest rates to entice investors to buy their bonds. When this happens, bond prices fall. \n\nTherefore, an expansionary monetary policy, which is intended to increase demand and stimulate economic growth, can cause bond prices to fall.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the effect of each of these factors on households' demand for money as an asset. Households demand money as an asset to hold as a store of value, to transact with, and as a medium of exchange. \n\n(A) Nominal GDP falls - When nominal GDP falls, the expected inflation rate falls too. This means that the purchasing power of money erodes at a slower rate. Therefore, households are more likely to hold money as an asset to transact with and as a medium of exchange. \n\n(B) Nominal interest rate falls - When the nominal interest rate falls, the opportunity cost of holding money as an asset falls too. This means that households are more likely to hold money as an asset to store their wealth. \n\n(C) Bond prices fall - When bond prices fall, the expected return on bonds rises. This means that households are more likely to hold bonds as an asset to get higher returns. \n\n(D) Supply of money falls - When the supply of money falls, the purchasing power of money increases. This means that households are more likely to hold money as an asset to store their wealth. \n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is (A) nominal GDP falls.",
