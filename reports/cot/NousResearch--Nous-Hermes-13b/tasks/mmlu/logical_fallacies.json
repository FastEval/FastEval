            "model_answer": "The fallacy of style over substance is best described by option C: \"Reasoning that ideas presented in an appealing manner are correct, regardless of the content of the message.\"\n\nExplanation: \nThe fallacy of style over substance refers to the notion that a claim or argument can be deemed correct or persuasive merely because it is presented in a pleasant, appealing or charismatic manner, rather than on the merits of the substance, content or reasoning itself. Option C captures this idea of reasoning based on the way something is presented rather than on the content itself. The other options deal with specific rhetorical strategies that may be used to enhance the appeal of a message, but they don't necessarily equate the style with the substance or reasoning itself.",
