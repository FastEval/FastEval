            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) leads to a valid conclusion. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\nFirst, we know that a valid disjunctive syllogism has a major premise that:\n- includes two or more alternatives (A) \n- classifies subjects (B) \n- affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent (C) \n\nA valid disjunctive syllogism must have a conclusion that follows logically from the premises. Therefore, a valid disjunctive syllogism must lead to a valid conclusion. This means that the conclusion must be true if the premises are true, and false if the premises are false. \n\nWhile options (B) and (C) are true, only option (D) ensures that the conclusion is valid. Therefore, the answer is (D) leads to a valid conclusion. The final line should contain the answer as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else, so the final answer is:\n\nD",
