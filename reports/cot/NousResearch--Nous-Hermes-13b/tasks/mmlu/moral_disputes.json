Jus ad bellum refers to the reasons why a war can be justified, while jus in bello refers to the rules that govern how the war is fought. Moral nihilism is an ethical theory that rejects the existence of all absolute moral principles.\n\nStep 4: Make an educated guess\nBased on the answer choices, we can reject option C and D as they are not principles of just war theory. Therefore, we can choose between options A and B. \n\nStep 5: Verify the answer\nThe principle of military necessity belongs to jus in bello. Therefore, the correct answer is option A. \n\nFinal answer: A.",

Then, we can determine which one is the correct answer.\n\nStatement (A) argues that feminist rhetoric obscures the harms of noncoerced, consensual sex by implying that because what is coerced is bad what is noncoerced is good. In other words, this statement suggests that feminists devalue noncoerced sex and imply that it is always problematic. \n\nStatement (B) argues that feminist rhetoric obscures the harms of rape by equating all sex with nonconsensual sex. This means that according to this statement, feminists consider all sex to be violent and insist on abolishing it.\n\nStatement (C) argues that by not acknowledging a distinction between what is good and what noncoerced, feminists have led to the acknowledgement of the harms of consensual sex. Regardless of the content of the statement, it contradicts statement (B) and (D). Statement (B) argues that feminists equate all sex with nonconsensual sex, while statement (C) argues that they fail to acknowledge the distinction between what is good and what is noncoerced.

One type of cloning is called somatic cell nuclear transfer, which involves replacing the nucleus of a somatic cell (a cell other than a sperm or egg cell) with the nucleus of a cell from an already existing animal (usually from an embryo or a body cell). This new hybrid cell is then stimulated to develop into an organism. The \"S\" in SCNT stands for \"somatic,\" which refers to somatic cells. The \"C\" stands for \"cell,\" and the \"N\" stands for \"nuclear transfer.\" Therefore, SCNT specifically refers to somatic cell nuclear transfer, which is a type of cloning.",

Preventive or specific: The justification for punishment is the prevention of future crime by the offender.\n\n2. Proportional: The justification for punishment is that the severity of the punishment should be proportionate to the severity of the crime committed.\n\n3. Equality: The justification for punishment is that it should treat all offenders equally, regardless of the severity of the crime committed.\n\n4. Retaliatory: The justification for punishment is that it should act as retribution or revenge for the harm caused.\n\nSince Nathanson advocates for punitive retributivism, it is reasonable to assume that he would support the fourth option, retaliatory retributivism, as it involves the idea of exacting retribution or vengeance on an offender for their wrongful act.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n\n(D) retaliatory.",

So, the question is asking about Carruthers' principles or moral theory, rather than his personal opinions or beliefs.\n\nNow, let's examine each of the given options and see which one aligns with the information we have: \n\n(A) consequentialism: This moral theory focuses on the outcome or consequences of an action, rather than the act itself. It doesn't necessarily address the moral standing of nonhuman animals.\n\n(B) Kantianism: This moral theory is based on Kant's categorical imperative, which requires that we treat human beings as ends in themselves, not as means to an end. It doesn't directly address the moral standing of nonhuman animals.\n\n(C) virtue ethics: This moral theory focuses on character and virtues, rather than rules or outcomes. It doesn't necessarily address the moral standing of nonhuman animals.\n\n(D) contractualism: This moral theory is based on the idea of moral obligations that result from voluntary agreements or contracts. It doesn't necessarily address the moral standing of nonhuman animals.\n\nNone of the options seem to fit based on the information we have.
