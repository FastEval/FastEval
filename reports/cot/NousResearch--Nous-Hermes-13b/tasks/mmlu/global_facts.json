This information can be obtained from government health organizations or trusted sources. After obtaining the data, we can calculate the percentage by dividing the number of overweight adults by the total number of adults and multiplying by 100. Once we have this percentage, we can determine the correct answer.\n\n(A) 10%",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Estimate the GDP per capita in 1850, without adjusting for inflation or PPP.\n2. Estimate the change in GDP per capita between 1850 and 2011, after adjusting for inflation.\n3. Estimate the difference in GDP per capita between the US and third world countries in 2011.\n4. Use Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) to adjust the GDP per capita ratio between the US and third world countries.\n5. Multiply the adjusted GDP per capita ratio by the GDP per capita in the US in 2011 to get the GDP per capita in the US in 1850.\n\nStep 1: Estimate the GDP per capita in 1850, without adjusting for inflation or PPP.\n\nIt is difficult to give an exact figure for GDP per capita in 1850 without adjusting for inflation or PPP, as this requires an estimate of total GDP and population. According to some sources, the US GDP in 1850 was around $26.1 billion (in 2011 dollars) and the population was around 23 million. If we divide the GDP by the population, we get an estimate of around $1,140 per capita in 1850.\n\nStep 2: Estimate the change in GDP per capita between 1850 and 2011, after adjusting for inflation.\n\nAccording to some sources, the US GDP in 2011 was around $15.2 trillion (in 2011 dollars) and the population was around 312 million. If we divide the GDP by the population, we get an estimate of around $48,134 per capita in 2011 (after adjusting for inflation).\n\nStep 3: Estimate the difference in GDP per capita between the US and third world countries in 2011.\n\nIt is difficult to give an exact figure for this difference as it depends on which third world countries we are comparing the US to, and on the definition of a \"third world country\". However, according to some studies, the GDP per capita in some third world countries in 2011 was around $1,000 or less.\n\nStep 4: Use Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) to adjust the GDP per capita ratio between the US and third world countries.\n\nPPP adjusts GDP per capita ratios between countries based on the purchasing power of their currencies. According to the International Comparison Program (ICP), the US had a PPP-adjusted GDP per capita of around $48,134 in 2011, while India had a PPP-adjusted GDP per capita of around $4,300 in 2011.\n\nStep 5: Multiply the adjusted GDP per capita ratio by the GDP per capita in the US in 2011.\n\nUsing the adjusted GDP per capita ratio from the ICP of $48,134 for the US and $4,300 for India:\n\n$48,134 / $4,300 = 11.1\n\nMultiply $48,134 by 11.1 to get an estimate of around $532,000.\n\n(A) About $300\n\nSo, after adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices, the GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 was approximately $300.",

            "question": "Controlling for inflation and PPP-adjustment, about how much did GDP per capita increase from 1950 to 2016 in Japan?\n\n(A) by 5 fold\n(B) by 10 fold\n(C) by 15 fold\n(D) by 20 fold",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the answer, we need to control for inflation and PPP-adjustment in both 1950 and 2016. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the nominal GDP per capita for both years. The nominal GDP per capita represents the value of all goods and services produced within a country divided by the population. \n\nFor 1950, the nominal GDP per capita of Japan is estimated to be $947.2 billion (in 2016 dollars adjusted for PPP). The population of Japan in 1950 was approximately 71.5 million people. So the nominal GDP per capita of Japan in 1950 was $947.2 billion / 71.5 million = $12.81 (in 2016 dollars adjusted for PPP). \n\nFor 2016, the nominal GDP per capita of Japan is estimated to be $41,261.2 billion (in 2016 dollars adjusted for PPP). The population of Japan in 2016 was approximately 126.5 million people. So the nominal GDP per capita of Japan in 2016 was $41,261.2 billion / 126.5 million = $323.17 (in 2016 dollars adjusted for PPP).\n\nNow we can calculate the percentage increase in nominal GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016. \n\n((323.17 - 12.81) / 12.81) * 100 = 2742.26%\n\nHowever, this number includes inflation, which we need to adjust for. A rule of thumb for this purpose is to compare the price of a consistent bundles of goods and services (e.g. consumer basket) over time. \n\nAccording to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the price of the consumer bundle of goods and services in the US increased by a factor of about 7.6 from 1950 to 2016. Using this information, we can adjust our estimate of the percentage increase in nominal GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016. \n\nAdjusted percentage increase = ((2742.26 / 7.6) * 100) = 361.61%\n\nNow we need to control for PPP-adjustment. The PPP-adjusted GDP per capita takes into account differences in the cost of living across countries. \n\nAccording to the International Comparison Program, the ratio of US GDP per capita to Japanese GDP per capita (in terms of purchasing power parity) was 1.59 in 1950, and 0.91 in 2016. This means that Japanese GDP per capita was 59% (1 / 1.59) higher in terms of purchasing power parity in 1950, and 9% (1 / 0.91) higher in terms of purchasing power parity in 2016. \n\nTo get the increase in PPP-adjusted GDP per capita, we can take the geometric mean of these two ratios: \n\n((1 / 1.59)^0.5 + (1 / 0.91)^0.5)^0.5 = 1.23\n\nWe now know that the increase in PPP-adjusted GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016 for Japan was 123%. \n\nTherefore, to control for inflation, PPP-adjustment, and nominal GDP per capita, the increase in real (inflation-adjusted and PPP-adjusted) GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016 in Japan was approximately 123%. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n(A) by 5 fold did not increase by 123%, so this is not the best answer.\n\n(B) by 10 fold did not increase by 123%, so this is not the best answer.\n\n(C) by 15 fold did not increase by 123%, so this is not the best answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) by 20 fold did not increase by 123%, so this is not the best answer.\n\nThe answer is none of the above.",
