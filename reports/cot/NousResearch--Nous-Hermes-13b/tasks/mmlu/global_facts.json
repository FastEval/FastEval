            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the problem. We need to find the GDP per capita of the United States in 1850 when adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices.\n\nStep 2: Look for relevant information. We need to calculate the difference in purchasing power between 1850 and 2011 dollars. This can be done by using the GDP deflator for the US and the nominal GDP at the time. We also need to calculate the increase in GDP per capita for the US between 1850 and 2011.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the answer. Using data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, we can estimate that the GDP deflator in 1850 was around 1.6 and in 2011 was around 0.8. This means that the ratio of 2011 GDP to 1850 GDP is roughly 6.4. Similarly, the ratio of 2011 population to 1850 population is roughly 6.3. Therefore, 2011 GDP per capita is around 6.4 x 6.3 x 8.5 = $49,820. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) About $300.",

First, we need to know the total population of Brazil in 2017. According to the World Bank, the estimated population of Brazil in 2017 was approximately 211 million.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out what percentage of the Brazilian population used the internet in the past three months as of 2017. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in 2017, approximately 66.2% of the Brazilian population aged 15 years and above used the internet in the past three months.\n\n3. To find out what fraction of the population in Brazil used the internet in the past three months as of 2017, we need to divide the percentage of the Brazilian population that used the internet in the past three months by the total population of Brazil in 2017. \n\n4. Fraction of the population that used the internet in the past three months (in percentage) / Total population of Brazil (in millions) = Fraction of the population that used the internet in the past three months.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the Brazilian population that used the internet in the past three months as of 2017 was approximately 66.2% / 211 = 0.3157 (rounded to four decimal places).\n\n5.
