If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the estimated yearly yield on your investment, we need to consider the daily expenses and the rental income. First, let's calculate the daily revenue: \n\nRental Income = (2 hours/day) x ($245/hour) x (365 days/year) x 0.5 (assuming you work all year round)\nRental Income = $43800 per day\n\nNow let's calculate the daily expenses:\nDaily Expenses = ($98000 initial investment) + ($50/day)\nDaily Expenses = $98050/day\n\nSo the daily profit is:\nDaily Profit = Rental Income - Daily Expenses\nDaily Profit = $43800 - $98050/day\nDaily Profit = -$54250/day\n\nTo find the yearly yield, we need to take into account that you're not working on weekends and festivities. Let's assume that the car is rented every day of the year except for weekends and holidays (approximately 360 days/year).\n\nYearly Rental Income = (360 days/year) x $43800/day\nYearly Rental Income = $15802000 per year\n\nYearly Expenses = ($98000 initial investment) + ($50/day x 73 days)\n$50 x 73 = $3650, so Yearly Expenses = $98050 + $3650\nYearly Expenses = $101650/year\n\nNet Income (Yearly) = Yearly Income - Yearly Expenses \nNet Income = $15802000 - $101650\nNet Income = $14785450 per year\n\nTherefore, the estimated yearly yield on your investment is:\n(A) 164%",

What effect did the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise have on Arno's balance sheet at year end? Assets Liabilities\n\n(A) No effect No effect\n(B) No effect Understated\n(C) Understated No effect\n(D) Understated Understated",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is D. \n\nExplanation: \nIf Arno Co. did not record a credit purchase of merchandise made prior to year end, it means that the company failed to record an asset. Assets are recorded when a company receives something of value (such as merchandise) in exchange for a liability (such as a loan or a credit card payment).\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory means that the company's inventory was correctly valued at the end of the year. This does not affect the balance sheet directly, as inventory is a component of current assets, which are already separated from current liabilities on the balance sheet.\n\nTherefore, the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise would result in an understated asset (merchandise), which would in turn understate the company's total assets on the balance sheet. This would then also affect the current ratio and other financial ratios that rely on total assets and current liabilities.",

Therefore, the correct answer would be the one that pertains to nonissuers.\n\nAmong the given options, only (D) refers to sampling risk and it includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective. This risk is relevant to nonissuers because they may not have the necessary expertise or resources to conduct comprehensive audits, and they may need to rely on sampling techniques to test a portion of their financial statements. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).",

This means that the amount of interest expense reported on the financial statements would have been lower than the actual cash paid out for interest.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Answer: A) $100\nReasoning: To find the price of the bond, we can use the formula for the price of a bond, which is given by: $100/(1+y)^n, where y is the yield and n is the number of years until maturity. \nIn this case, we want to find the price of a three-year bond (n=3) with a yield of 6% (y=0.06). So, we can plug these values into the formula: $100/(1+0.06)^3.\nCalculating this, we get: $100/0.940448, which equals approximately $106.23. \nHowever, we are also given that the bond pays a coupon of 5% each year for three years. To account for this, we need to adjust the formula, since the bond will be worth more than the face value since it will be generating coupon payments. The formula for price with coupons should be: $100/((1+y1)^n) + (C/((1+y1)^n*((1+y2)^n)) * (1+(y1/y2)) + (y1*(1-((1+y2)^n/(1+y1)^n)))).\nwhere C is the face value of the bond, y1 is the first coupon rate (5% or 0.05), y2 is the second coupon rate (5% or 0.05) and n is the number of years until maturity (3).\nUsing this formula, we get: $100/((1+0.05)^3) + (100/((1+0.05)^3) * ((1+0.05)^3) + (0.05*(1-((1+0.05)^3/((1+0.05)^3))))\nCalculating this, we get: $100/0.951053, which equals approximately $103.96.\nTherefore, the price of the bond, including coupon payments, is approximately $106.23.",

Calculate Carson's pro-rata share of the taxable income after taking into account the cash dividends paid.\n3. Calculate Carson's total income for the year, including the pro-rata share of the taxable income from step 2.\n4. Determine the amount of gross income reported on Carson's individual tax return.\n5. Apply the appropriate tax rate to determine the amount of income tax owed by Carson.\n\nLet's start solving the problem:\n\n1. Carson owns 40% of the outstanding stock of the corporation. Therefore, Carson's pro-rata share of the taxable income is 40% of $400,000, which is $160,000.\n2. Carson received $70,000 in cash dividends from the corporation. To calculate Carson's pro-rata share of the taxable income after taking into account the cash dividends, we need to subtract the cash dividends from the total taxable income and then multiply the result by Carson's ownership percentage. The amount of taxable income after taking into account the cash dividends is $400,000 - $70,000 = $330,000. Carson's pro-rata share of the taxable income after taking into account the cash dividends is 40% of $330,000, which is $132,000.\n3. Carson's total income for the year, including the pro-rata share of the taxable income, is $160,000 (taxable income) + $132,000 (after taking into account the cash dividends) = $292,000.\n4. Carson accurately reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson's individual tax return.\n5. We don't have any information about the tax rate applicable to Carson. Therefore, we cannot determine the amount of income tax owed by Carson.\n\nBased on the information provided, if the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate, Carson would have reported $28,000 in gross income on Carson's individual return.",
