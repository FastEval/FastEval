However, the omission will affect the accuracy of the balance sheet for the current year. The merchandise inventory will be understated on the balance sheet because the value of the inventory is calculated as the beginning inventory plus the purchases minus the sales. Since the purchase is not recorded, the inventory value will be understated by the amount of the purchase.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine which procedure an auditor would generally perform regarding subsequent events, we need to consider the nature of subsequent events and their impact on the financial statements.\n\nSubsequent events are events that occur between the date of the balance sheet and the auditor's report or the date of the audit report, whichever is earlier. The auditor's responsibility is to evaluate the potential impact of these events on the financial statements and to either express a conclusion or disclaim an opinion on the financial statements if the impact is significant.\n\nStarting with option (A): Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end. This option is not related to subsequent events. The auditor might perform this procedure as part of their physical inventory observation, but it is not related to subsequent events.\n\nMoving to option (B): Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate. This option is also not related to subsequent events. The auditor might perform this procedure as part of their audit of the internal control over financial reporting. However, it is not related to subsequent events.\n\nNow, let's consider option (C): Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end. This option may be related to subsequent events, depending on the specific circumstances of the engagement. If there are significant transactions or events that occur after the balance sheet date, the auditor may need to review the cutoff bank statements to determine their impact on the financial statements.\n\nFinally, let's examine option (D): Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited. This option could be related to subsequent events, depending on the specific circumstances of the engagement. If the financial statements being audited are interim financial statements, and there are significant events or transactions that occur between the date of the interim financial statements and the date of the auditor's report, the auditor may need to compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited to determine their impact on the financial statements.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the question would depend on the specific circumstances of the engagement. However, in general, it would not be process (A), (B), or (C) that an auditor would perform regarding subsequent events. The most likely answer would be (D). However, the final answer can only be determined after considering the specific circumstances of the engagement.",

The cash flow in year five is $500, and the cash flow in year ten is also $500. Both cash flows are positive.\n\nThe formula for calculating NPV is as follows:\n\nNPV = (C5 + C10) / (1 + r)^5\n\nWhere:\nC5 = Cash flow in year five\nC10 = Cash flow in year ten\nr = Discount rate\n\nGiven the cash flows and the discount rate, we can plug in the values:\n\nNPV = ($500 + $500) / (1 + 0.10)^5\n\nNPV = $1000 / 1.6289\n\nNPV \u2248 $611.85\n\nThe NPV of the project is approximately $611.85.

The straight-line method provides equal periodic cash flows over the life of the bond, and it results in a higher expense in the early years and a lower expense in the later years. \n\n3. The effective interest method takes into account the time value of money, and it provides a more accurate representation of the periodic cash flows throughout the life of the bond. \n\n4. To determine the answer, we need to calculate the amount of amortization that would have been recorded using the effective interest method and compare it to the amount recorded using the straight-line method. \n\n5.

            "model_answer": "The price of a bond is calculated using the following formula: \n\nPrice = [Coupon Payments/ (Yield - Coupon Rate)] \n\nIn this case, the face value of the bond is $100, and the bond pays a 5% coupon, which means it pays out $5 per year. The yield on the bond is given as 6%, which translates to an effective interest rate (EIR) of 5.56% (calculated as: percentage yield = percentage return - tax Dragon Slayer). We can use the EIR for the purpose of this calculation as both measures represent the return on investment. \n\nNow, we will use the formula to calculate the price of the bond:\n\nPrice = $[5 / (5.56% - 5%)]\n\nPrice = $[5 / (0.0556 - 0.05)]\n\nPrice = $[5 / 0.0056]\n\nPrice = $97.33\n\nTherefore, the price of a three-year bond paying 5% coupons, with a yield of 6%, is $97.33.",

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the portion of the taxable income that corresponds to Carson's ownership of 40% of the outstanding stock. We can do this by multiplying the total taxable income by the percentage of stock owned by Carson.\n\n400,000 * 0.4 = $160,000\n\nSince Carson received $70,000 in cash dividends from the corporation, we need to subtract this amount from the portion of the taxable income attributed to Carson.\n\n160,000 - 70,000 = $90,000\n\nNow that we know the amount of taxable income that corresponds to Carson's ownership of the stock, we can calculate how much income Carson would have reported on their individual tax return if the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions had been proportionate.\n\n28,000 * (90,000 / 400,000) = $132,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) $132,000.",
