            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To solve this question step-by-step, we need to break down the sentence into smaller parts and figure out what words fill in each blank. Here's what we have:\n\nTypical advertising regulatory bodies suggest, for example that adverts must not: encourage [UNDESERTED practices], cause [UNNECESSARY wants], [FEAR] and [TRIVIAL], and must not cause [SERIOUS] offence.\n\nNow that we have the full sentence, we can start to figure out what word belongs in each blank. Let's take them one by one:\n\n1. Encourage unsafe practices - This means that adverts must not encourage people to do something unsafe.\n\n2. Cause unnecessary wants - This means that adverts must not try to persuade people to want something that they don't really need.\n\n3. Fear - This is a bit tricky, because the sentence doesn't explicitly say that adverts must not cause fear. However, we know that they must not cause \"FEAR\" and \"TRIVIA\", so we can assume that this refers to fear as well.\n\n4. Trivial - This means that adverts must not try to persuade people to want something that is unimportant or unimportant.\n\n5. Cause serious offence - This means that adverts must not try to persuade people to do something that would cause someone else serious harm or injury.\n\nNow let's put it all together:\n\nTypical advertising regulatory bodies suggest, for example that adverts must not: encourage [UNDESERTED practices], cause [UNNECESSARY wants], [FEAR] and [TRIVIAL], and must not cause [SERIOUS] offence.\n\n(A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\n(B) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n(C) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\n(D) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious\n\nThe answer is (A) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial.",

In an employer-employee relationship, the duties and responsibilities of both parties are essential to maintain a harmonious work environment. \nEmployee rights are the obligations of employers towards their employees, based on individual contracts and wider employment laws. These rights define the minimum standards of treatment, wages, and working conditions that an employer must provide to their employees. \nTherefore, (B) Employee rights is the correct answer.",

Moving on to the middle term, \"Benefits\" is an antonym of \"unfair,\" so \"unfair\" won't work.\n3. For the first term, we are looking for something that describes a one-sided relationship where one party has more power or resources than the other. \"Power imbalance\" and \"unfair distribution of resources\" are both possibilities.\n4.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer to the question is (A) hedonistic utilitarianism. Here is the reasoning:\n\nMajor normative theories include utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, and ethics of care. Hedonistic utilitarianism is the most similar to profit maximization because it focuses on maximizing overall pleasure and happiness for all individuals, which can be seen as similar to maximizing profits for a corporation. Hedonic utilitarianism argues that the best action is one that maximizes the greatest number of positive experiences, without considering the nature of the act itself, the motive for the action, or the character of the person who acts. This is similar to profit maximization, which focuses on maximizing revenue and profits without considering the motives, character, or other factors of the corporation or its stakeholders. Therefore, the answer is (A) hedonistic utilitarianism.",

Milton Friedman was an economist who believed in the free market and limited government intervention.\n2. One of his major ideas was that businesses should only focus on making profits and that there is no other societal responsibility for them to fulfill.\n3. This means that the sole responsibility of business is to its shareholders, who are the owners of the company and have a legal claim to the profits made by the company.\n4.
