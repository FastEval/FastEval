The second part of the statement \"and must not cause unnecessary distress\" is the same for both. Finally, the last part of the statement \"or create serious offence\" is hyphenated as \"or-create serious-offence\" and is the same for both options.

Here's why:\nIn the question, the first limitation and risk mentioned is power imbalance, where one party possesses more resources. This is mentioned in step 1. \nThe next risk mentioned is unfair distribution of benefits, where one party gains more from the relationship. However, this risk is not directly related to power imbalance. So, we can eliminate option B and C.\nThe third risk mentioned is that CSOs can be hoodwinked, which means they can be deceived or manipulated. This risk is not directly related to power imbalance or unfair distribution of benefits. So, we can eliminate option A as well.\nThus, the correct answer is (D) Informational asymmetries, Resources, Co-opted, as it is the only remaining option that is directly related to power imbalance and unfair distribution of benefits.",

It describes the ability to adapt to changing circumstances, a quality that is essential in the workplace. Both Dynamic and Modern can also describe fluidity, but they focus more on the speed or up-to-date nature of the work rather than the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Fluid, on the other hand, can also refer to the ability to adapt to changing circumstances, but it is less common than the other options presented. Therefore, the correct answer is C) Flexible.",
