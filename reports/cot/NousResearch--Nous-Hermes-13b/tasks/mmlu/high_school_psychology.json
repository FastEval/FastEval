            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) too much curvature of the cornea and lens. \n\nReasoning: \n1. Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is a refractive error in which light rays converge in front of the retina instead of on it. \n2. The cornea and lens are the two main components of the eye that contribute to the focusing of light rays. The cornea is responsible for bending light rays as they enter the eye, while the lens further bends the light rays to focus them onto the retina. \n3. In most cases, nearsightedness is caused by a combination of factors, including an overly curved cornea and an overly curved lens. Both the cornea and the lens have a certain amount of \"springiness\" or elasticity, and when they are too curved, they can cause light rays to converge in front of the retina instead of on it. \n4. Option (C) is incorrect because the iris does not have any effect on the focusing of light rays. The iris is the colored part of the eye that surrounds the pupil and controls the amount of light that enters the eye. \n5. Option (D) is also incorrect because having too little curvature of the cornea and lens can actually result in farsightedness, also known as hyperopia, rather than nearsightedness. Farsightedness is a refractive error in which light rays converge behind the retina instead of on it. \n\nThus, the correct answer is option (A) too much curvature of the cornea and lens.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is B. Schizophrenia.\n\nExplanation:\n\nOne possible step-by-step explanation could go like this:\n\n- OCD is characterized by obsessions and compulsions. Delusions of grandeur do not fit with this disorder.\n- Conversion disorder is characterized by physical symptoms that have no physical cause. Delusions of grandeur may or may not be present, but they are not specific to this disorder.\n- Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a lack of regard for the rights of others, deceitfulness, and impulsivity. Delusions of grandeur are not a specific defining feature of this disorder.\n\n- Therefore, the disorder most characteristic of delusions of grandeur is Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is characterized by a break from reality, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thoughts and speech, and lack of motivation. Delusions of grandeur are a common symptom in people with schizophrenia.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Hierarchy of needs. \n\nThe concept of the hierarchy of needs is a fundamental theory in Abraham Maslow's motivational psychology. Maslow proposed that humans have a range of needs that must be met in a specific order. The most basic needs, such as physiological and safety needs, must be met before higher-level needs, such as social and self-actualization needs, can be addressed. \n\nAccording to Maslow, some motives are more imperative to survival than others. The hierarchy of needs expresses this idea by placing basic survival needs at the bottom of the pyramid and more advanced needs at the top of the pyramid. Only when the lower-level needs have been met can a person focus on the higher-level needs.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider each part of the definition of validity and break it down:\n\n(A) measures what it purports to measure: This part of the definition refers to the content validity of a test. Content validity means that the test should cover all the important domains, topics or skills that it is supposed to measure. So the correct answer for this part is (A) measures what it purports to measure.\n\n(B) yields consistent results on successive administrations: This part of the definition refers to the stability of a test. Stability means that the test should produce consistent scores when administered multiple times to the same person or group of people. So the correct answer for this part is (B) yields consistent results on successive administrations.\n\n(C) has been piloted and statistically analyzed: This part of the definition refers to the construction validity of a test. Construction validity means that the test should be properly developed, pre-tested and revised based on the feedback from the pre-testing. So the correct answer for this part is (C) has been piloted and statistically analyzed.\n\n(D) includes norms based on a representative sample of the general population: This part of the definition refers to the normative validity of a test. Normative validity means that the test should have norms (scores and percentiles) that are representative of the general population. So the correct answer for this part is (D) includes norms based on a representative sample of the general population.\n\nCombining all the parts of the definition, the final answer is:\n\nMeasures what it purports to measure (A) + Yields consistent results on successive administrations (B) + Has been piloted and statistically analyzed (C) + Includes norms based on a representative sample of the general population (D) = The degree to which a test is valid depends on its content validity, stability, construction validity and normative validity.",

Heritability is the proportion of phenotypic variation in a population that is attributable to genetic variation among individuals. In other words, it measures the extent to which traits are passed down from generation to generation through genes.\n\n2. Determine the context of the problem. We are given the information about a cloned population. Cloning is the process of creating a genetically identical copy of an existing organism. So, in a cloned population, all individuals are genetically identical to each other.\n\n3. Use deductive reasoning. If all individuals in a cloned population are genetically identical, then there are no genetic variations among them. And if there are no genetic variations, then there cannot be any phenotypic variations (traits) attributable to these genetic variations.\n\n4. Conclusion. In a cloned population, the heritability for traits is 0%.",

Kohlberg's moral development theory focuses on how individuals develop moral reasoning and rights and wrongs. Ainsworth's social attachment theory focuses on how early attachment relationships influence personality development.\n\nErikson's psychosocial stage theory, however, fits the description we are looking for as it describes eight stages of development that occur throughout the entire life span, and each stage is characterized by a psychological crisis which the individual must resolve in order to move on to the next stage. These crises involve various aspects of life, such as trust vs. mistrust (infancy), autonomy vs. shame and doubt (early childhood), initiative vs. guilt (early adolescence), industry vs. inferiority (late adolescence), identity vs. role confusion (young adulthood), intimacy vs. isolation (adulthood), generativity vs. stagnation (middle adulthood), and integrity vs. despair (old age). The resolution of these crises shapes an individual's personality and character traits.\n\nTherefore, (B) Erikson's psychosocial stage theory is the correct answer.",
