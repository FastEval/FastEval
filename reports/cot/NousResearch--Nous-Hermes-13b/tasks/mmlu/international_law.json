            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The state that ordinarily exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels is (A) the coastal State.\n\nExplanation: According to international law, the coastal state has jurisdiction over vessels and events in its territorial sea, including crimes committed on board vessels. The flag state, on the other hand, has jurisdiction over the face of the sea and may exercise its jurisdiction over vessels flying its flag. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea deals with specific cases of disputes over maritime law and has limited jurisdiction.",

            "question": "What is the meaning of justiciability?\n\n(A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders\n(B) Justiciability refers to the just nature or cause of a particular right\n(C) Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular rights conforms to principles of justice\n(D) Justiciability refers to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular Right",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders.\n\nExplanation:\nJusticiability is a legal term that refers to the ability or possibility of a matter being brought before a court of law and being adjudicated upon. Simply put, it means the enforceability of a right or claim through legal proceedings. \n\nThe term \"justiciability\" is derived from the Latin word \"justiciarius,\" which means \"administering justice.\" The concept of justiciability is closely related to the concept of jurisdiction, as jurisdiction refers to the power of a court to hear and determine a particular case.\n\nIn essence, justiciability is about determining whether a particular right has legal redress and, if so, whether the matter is appropriate for resolution by the courts. This means that for a matter to be justiciable, it must involve a live controversy that is suitable for judicial resolution, and the person or entity bringing the case must have standing to do so.\n\nTherefore, (A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders is the correct answer.",

            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The main difference between R2P and humanitarian intervention is that R2P is not as arbitrary as humanitarian intervention. Humanitarian intervention is often seen as a unilateral action taken by one country to protect civilians in another country. It is often perceived as an act of aggression and is not always supported by the international community. On the other hand, R2P is based on the principle of state responsibility to protect its citizens from four crimes: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. R2P also requires some input from the UN Security Council and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis. Therefore, R2P is a more legal and legitimate framework than humanitarian intervention. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).",

            "model_answer": "The Lotus principle is not a single answer, but rather a set of legal maxims and interpretations derived from international law cases and customary practice over the years. The legal maxims and interpretations that fall under the umbrella of the Lotus principle include:\n\n- The restrictive theory of State jurisdiction \n- The principle of sovereign equality \n- The prohibition of the use of force \n- The principle that whatever is not prohibited is permitted \n- The principle of lex posterior derogat legi priori \n- The principle of the freedom of the high seas \n\nEach of these maxims and interpretations has its own nuances and exceptions, and they are often applied in combination with one another in specific cases.

This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes\n(C) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute\n(D) It is an obligation which concerns solely international courts and tribunals",

This obligation is considered a fundamental principle of international law and is intended to promote peace and security among nations.
