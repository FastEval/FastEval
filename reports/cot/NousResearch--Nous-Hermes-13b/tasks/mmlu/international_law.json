            "question": "Which State ordinarily exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels?\n\n(A) The coastal State\n(B) The flag State\n(C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction\n(D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) The coastal State. \n\nReasoning:\nThis question is related to the Law of the Sea and international law. The Law of the Sea defines the rights and responsibilities of nations with respect to their use of the global ocean and its resources.\n\nWhen a crime is committed on board a vessel, international law provides different jurisdictional rules depending on the circumstances of the crime. The jurisdiction of the coastal State comes into play when the crime is committed in its territorial waters or its exclusive economic zone.\n\nThe flag State's jurisdiction applies when the vessel is registered under the flag of that State. However, this jurisdictional rule is limited when the criminal act was not premeditated or was not committed by a person who is a national of the flag State.\n\nUnder international law, all States enjoy jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed by their nationals or on board their vessels. Additionally, international tribunals like the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea can exercise jurisdiction over certain maritime disputes.\n\nIn conclusion, the coastal State is the answer to the question because according to the Law of the Sea, the coastal State has jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels in its territorial waters or exclusive economic zone.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders.\n\nExplanation step-by-step:\n\nJusticiability means the ability or possibility to bring a legal case or claim before a court of law and have it decided upon. It refers to the enforceability of a particular right. \n\nTo determine whether a right is justiciable, the courts evaluate whether the party seeking to enforce the right has standing (i.e., whether they have a legal interest in the matter), whether the right is sufficiently definite and concrete, and whether the remedy sought is available and not prohibited by law.\n\nIn summary, justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders.",

            "question": "In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The main difference between Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention lies in their objectives and the level of international consensus required before intervention.\n\nR2P is a principle that emphasizes the international community's responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. It requires a call for assistance by the State in distress, but it is not always clear who decides that the State is incapable of fulfilling its responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, humanitarian intervention involves the use of military force to protect civilians from violence or other forms of harm. The primary objective of humanitarian intervention is to stop or prevent the violation of humanitarian law or human rights.\n\nUnlike R2P, humanitarian intervention does not require any specific international consensus, and the decision to intervene can be taken by individual States or international organizations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.",

The principle, as enunciated by President Laferri\u00e8re in that case, is often paraphrased as \"whatever is not prohibited is permitted.\" This means that State sovereignty is generally respected, and restrictions upon the independence of States cannot be presumed, unless there is a clear violation of international law. Therefore, all States enjoy nearly complete freedom in regulating their domestic concerns, and it is only when their conduct affects other States or international society as a whole that their freedom may be limited by international law.",

This does not entail an obligation to resolve their disputes\n(C) It is a peremptory norm of international law and all States have a legal interest to safeguard its application in any given dispute\n(D) It is an obligation which concerns solely international courts and tribunals",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The obligation of peaceful settlement of disputes is an obligation of conduct. \n\nExplanation:\nInternational law contains several obligations of conduct towards the peaceful settlement of disputes. Firstly, States have an obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force in any dispute, unless in self-defense or with the authorization of the United Nations. Secondly, States must pursue settlement of their disputes by peaceful means, such as negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. Thirdly, if the parties are unable to reach a settlement through these means, they have an obligation to seek the assistance of an impartial third party, such as a mediator or conciliator. Fourthly, if the parties still cannot resolve their dispute, they may refer it to an international court or tribunal. Therefore, the obligation of peaceful settlement of disputes involves a series of actions and procedures that States must follow in order to solve their conflicts in a peaceful manner. \n\nAs a result, answer (B) is the correct option.",

This concept is closely related to the concept of legal personality in general, which refers to the ability of an entity - whether individual or collective - to engage in legal relationships and to bear the consequences of its actions.\n\nHaving international legal personality means that an entity is recognized by international law as being capable of participating in the international legal system.
