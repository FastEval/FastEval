            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) 5 permanent members with veto power, 10 rotating members with no veto power.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has 15 member states, but only 5 of them are permanent members with veto power: the United States, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom. The remaining 10 members are not permanent and serve two-year terms, with five new members being elected each year. These 10 non-permanent members do not have veto power over decisions made by the Security Council.",

            "question": "What was the significance of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution?\n\n(A) It allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam\n(B) It illustrated the influence of public opinion on US foreign policy\n(C) It enhanced Congressional control over the Vietnam War\n(D) It curtailed US involvement in Vietnam",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Option D (It curtailed US involvement in Vietnam) is correct.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed by the US Congress on August 7, 1964 in response to the Gulf of Tonkin Incident.\n2. Its official title was \"A resolution to authorize and direct the use of the Armed Forces of the United States in support of the Armed Forces of South Vietnam.\"\n3. The significance of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was that it granted President Lyndon B. Johnson broad authority to use military force in Vietnam, without declaring war.\n4. This resolution opened the door for a dramatic escalation of the US involvement in the Vietnam War. Before the resolution, the US had been providing support to the government of South Vietnam, but the resolution allowed for the deployment of US troops and the commencement of sustained bombing of North Vietnam.\n5. As such, option D is correct, as it accurately reflects the effect of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which was to enable and ultimately intensify the US involvement in Vietnam.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which of these options is not a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States, we need to break down what each option represents.\n\n(A) Terrorists - Yes, terrorists are a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States. They are a non-governmental organization that engages in acts of violence or combined arms to achieve political, religious, or ideological goals.\n\n(B) Organized crime - Yes, organized crime is also a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States. They are a group of individuals engaged in criminal activities that are organized in a highly structured manner.\n\n(C) Drug traffickers - Yes, drug traffickers are a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States. They are individuals or organizations involved in the shipment and sale of illegal drugs, often across international borders.\n\n(D) China - No, China is not a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States. China is a nation-state, specifically the most populous country in the world and the second largest economy after the United States. Though it may have regional ambitions and engage in regional conflicts, it is not a nonstate actor.\n\nTherefore, the option that is not a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States is (D) China.

            "model_answer": "The answer to this question cannot be determined without additional context or information. The implications of the Cold War for American exceptionalism can vary depending on multiple factors such as the time period, political perspective, and specific events or policies. Exceptionalism is the belief that a country or society is better than all others and has a duty to promote its values and spread its democratic system. During the Cold War, the United States saw itself as the leader of the free world and engaged in various actions to counter the expansion of communism. This increased American power and influence globally, which could be seen as enhancing exceptionalism based on the idea that America is the premier global leader. However, the broader implications of the Cold War and its impact on American exceptionalism are complex and multifaceted, and the answer to this question cannot be accurately determined without additional information.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The reasoning behind Franklin D. Roosevelt's initial isolationist stance can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, he believed that internal reform rather than international negotiation was the key to economic regeneration of the US. This meant focusing on domestic issues rather than engaging in foreign affairs. Secondly, he was cautious about the potential consequences of US involvement in Europe's political conflicts. Having witnessed the devastation of World War I, he was reluctant to become further embroiled in European conflicts. Finally, he was inclined towards an isolationist stance due to the country's own economic and social challenges. In summary, his initial isolationist stance was based on his prioritization of domestic issues and his desire to avoid entanglement in foreign affairs. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) he believed that internal reform rather than international negotiation was the key to economic regeneration of the US.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the answer to this question, it is important to consider the historical context and the events that led to the rise of this term.\n\nThe 'New Populism' was a political phenomenon that emerged in the Western world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a response to the rapid social, political, and economic changes brought about by industrialization and urbanization. The movement was characterized by a rejection of the elite and their traditional political party systems in favor of more direct democracy, and it often advocated for protectionist economic policies, among other things.\n\nIn the context of foreign policy, the 'New Populism' can be understood as a rejection of elite-driven internationalist policies in favor of a more nationalistic approach that put the interests of the people above those of the state. Thus, the answer to the question is (A) a strand of neo-isolationist sentiment.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy. \n\nStep-by-step reasoning: \nWorld War I, fought between 1914 and 1918, had a profound impact on the global economy, particularly on Europe. The devastation of the war, as well as the resultant redrawing of national borders, combined to produce economic instability in the region. This created opportunities for countries outside of Europe, particularly the United States, to step in and assert their economic power. \nOne way in which the US increased its economic power was through lending to Europe. The US supplied numerous goods and materials to the allied powers during the war, and as Europe struggled to rebuild after the conflict, it needed heavy doses of US capital to help finance reconstruction. The US served as a creditor country, providing loans to Europe in exchange for interest payments and other economic concessions. \nIn addition, the massive spending of the US government on military and other war-related expenses helped to boost the US economy. The war spending created a demand for US-made goods and services, which in turn led to job creation and economic growth. \nAs a result of these factors, World War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States. Europe became increasingly dependent on the United States for economic assistance, while the US emerged as a powerful creditor and financial center. The US economy was strengthened by the war, and the US dollar became the world's dominant currency.",
