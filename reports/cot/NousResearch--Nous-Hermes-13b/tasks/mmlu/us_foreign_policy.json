            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) 5 permanent members and 10 rotating members, all with veto power. Here's the reasoning: \n\nThe United Nations Security Council is one of the six main organs of the United Nations and is responsible for maintaining international peace and security. It is composed of 15 members, five of which are permanent and the other ten are elected for two-year terms. \n\nThe five permanent members are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These five countries have veto power, meaning they can block any resolution deemed to be against their interests. \n\nThe ten elected members are divided into two categories: five are from African and Asian countries, and the other five are from Latin America and Europe. These members also have veto power. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (B) 5 permanent members and 10 rotating members, all with veto power.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964 involved a supposed attack on US naval vessels by North Vietnamese torpedo boats. The US reaction to this incident was the passage of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, which granted President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to take \"all necessary measures\" to defend US forces and prevent further attacks. The resolution essentially paved the way for a more intensified US involvement in Vietnam, as it allowed for military escalation and the expansion of the war. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) It allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam.",

            "model_answer": "The answer to the question is (D) China. \nTo arrive at this answer, we need to analyze the options provided and determine which one does not pose a threat to the United States.\n\nA) Terrorists - Terrorists have been known to pose a significant threat to the United States, as they have carried out several deadly attacks on American soil and continue to plot and plan new ones.\n\nB) Organized crime - Organized crime groups also pose a threat to the United States, as they engage in activities such as drug trafficking, money laundering, and other criminal activities that can have negative consequences on the country.\n\nC) Drug traffickers - Drug traffickers are another nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States, as the drug trade generates significant profits that can be used to finance other criminal activities and can also lead to increased violence and crime rates.\n\nChina, on the other hand, is not typically considered a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States. While there may be some tensions and disagreements between the two countries, China is a state actor and a major economic and military power. Therefore, option (D) China is the answer to the question.",

            "model_answer": "The Cold War had both positive and negative implications for American exceptionalism. On the positive side, America's role as the 'leader of the free world' during the Cold War enhanced its status as a beacon of freedom and democracy, and reinforced the idea that America was a unique and exceptional nation. However, on the negative side, the extension of American power globally challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism, such as a belief in the inherent superiority of American political and economic systems. Moreover, the Cold War conflict with the Soviet Union created a siege mentality in the US, which led to a loss of confidence in American exceptionalism. Overall, the Cold War had a mixed impact on American exceptionalism, and it neither entirely ended nor enhanced its influence. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).",

            "model_answer": "The reason why Franklin D. Roosevelt initially favored an 'isolationist' stance on the part of the US during the 1930s can be attributed to all three options provided. \nFirstly, he believed that internal reform rather than international negotiation was the key to economic regeneration of the US. Roosevelt's main focus at the time was on addressing the Great Depression that had hit the US economy, and he felt that prioritizing domestic issues over foreign affairs was necessary to bring the country out of the economic crisis. \nSecondly, he believed that German domination of Europe would be in US interests. Roosevelt was cautious of Germany's aggressive expansionism under Adolf Hitler's leadership, and he did not want to see the country gain control over much of Europe. However, he also didn't want the US to become embroiled in another major conflict so soon after World War I. \nFinally, he always favored isolationism. Roosevelt believed that the US should stay out of foreign conflicts and focus on domestic issues. He felt that the country's resources and time would be better spent on rebuilding the economy and providing relief to the American people. \nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) All of the above.",

It was characterized by a popular reaction against the elites and the established powers that be. It often took the form of a reaction against big business and corruption. The New Populism was expressed through a variety of causes and movements, including the Progressive Movement, the Farmers' Alliance, and the Populist Party.

            "model_answer": "The answer to this question is (D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy.\n\nReasoning:\nWorld War I, fought between 1914 and 1918, had a profound impact on the global economy. Europe was devastated by the war, with millions of soldiers losing their lives and many more injured. The economies of Europe were also severely damaged, with infrastructure, businesses, and homes destroyed.\n\nIn contrast, the United States was able to stay out of the war until 1917, which allowed its economy to continue to grow unimpeded. When the US finally did enter the war, it lent money and resources to the Allied powers, which helped them continue to fight.\n\nThe war spending in Europe boosted the US economy, as it became a creditor country and a financial center. The US government sold war bonds to the public, which helped finance the war and boosted the economy. Additionally, the US dollar became the default currency for international trade, further cementing the US's place as a financial powerhouse.\n\nOverall, World War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States due to the financial and economic assistance provided to the Allied powers, the devastation of European economies, and the US's ability to remain unscathed until late in the war.",
