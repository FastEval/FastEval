            "model_answer": "The term for a suboptimal but acceptable outcome of negotiations between parties is (B) Satisficing. \n\nReasoning: \n- The first step in any negotiation is to consider the optimal outcome, which is the ideal result that both parties want to achieve. \n- However, sometimes due to various constraints like time, resources, or power imbalance, the negotiation may not result in the best possible outcome for both parties. \n- In such cases, where the outcome is less than optimal, but still acceptable for both parties, it is called Satisficing. \n- This term is derived from the combination of two words: Satisfy, meaning to make someone happy, and Suffice, meaning to be enough. \n- In satisficing, both parties compromise on their ideal outcome and settle for a suboptimal one that is acceptable to all.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The best answer is (D) Heuristics. \nThe reasoning behind this is as follows: \n\nHeuristics refer to mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that individuals use to make decisions quickly and efficiently. These shortcuts help people to cope with complexity and make judgments based on limited information. \n\n'Rule of thumb' type of bias is essentially a decision-making strategy that involves relying on simple and easy-to- apply rules to deal with complex situations. This is exactly what heuristics represent. \n\nWhile other options like Framing bias (A) and Hindsight bias (B) also involve biases in decision making, they are not part of the 'rule of thumb' type of decision making. Therefore, (C) Over-confidence bias is not a relevant option. \n\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Heuristics.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "A normative perspective is (C) the way things should be. This is because a normative perspective involves making judgments about how things should be done or what is considered proper, based on a set of values or ideals. It involves setting standards or guidelines for behavior or actions, and evaluating them based on whether they meet those standards. Therefore, (C) the way things should be is the correct answer for a normative perspective.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The type of competitive activity that exists between organisations in the 'five forces model' is (D) the level of rivalry. The five forces model was developed by Michael Porter and is used to analyze the competitive atmosphere of an industry. The five forces are: \n1. The potential for entry into the industry\n2. The threat of substitute products\n3. The power of suppliers\n4. The power of customers\n5. The level of rivalry\nThe level of rivalry refers to the intensity of competition among existing firms in an industry. It can be measured by the number of competitors, their relative sizes, and the aggressiveness of their behaviors. A high level of rivalry can lead to lower profit margins, reduced growth opportunities, and increase in costs due to price wars and other competitive tactics.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is B) Mikhail Gorbachov. \n\nGorbachov is considered a transformational leader because he was responsible for implementing major political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union, which ultimately led to the dissolution of the USSR. He initiated the policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring), which aimed to create a more democratic and open society in the USSR.\n\nMargaret Thatcher, on the other hand, is considered more of a conservative leader who opposed state intervention in the economy and promoted free market policies. Nelson Mandela was a transformational leader because he played a crucial role in the abolition of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic government in South Africa. Finally, Bill Clinton was also considered a transformational leader due to his progressive policies and initiatives, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and welfare reform.",

Therefore, the feature of McGregor's Theory X that makes the most sense is (D) Workers like to be directed. So the final answer is (D) Workers like to be directed.",

However, it does not refer to the power derived from status or position in an organization.\n\n(B) Expert: This term refers to individuals who possess specialized knowledge and experience in a particular field. While experts may have influence and power due to their expertise, this answer does not refer to the power derived from status or position in an organization.\n\n(C) Reward: This term refers to the positive outcomes or incentives that individuals receive for performing a particular behavior. While rewards may be associated with power, this answer does not specifically refer to the power derived from status or position in an organization.\n\n(D) Legitimate: This term refers to the power that individuals or groups have based on their right to hold a particular position or role. It emphasizes the legitimacy of their power \u2013 that is, the belief that their power is justified \u2013 rather than their specific status or position within an organization.
