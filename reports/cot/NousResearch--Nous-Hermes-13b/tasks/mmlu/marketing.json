            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question step-by-step, we need to break it down into smaller parts. First, we need to define what constitutes the end of the production period in marketing history. In this case, we can assume that the production period refers to the time when marketing activities were focused on producing goods and manufacturing. \n\nNext, we can look at the historical timeline of marketing to identify when this period ended. We can consider the following time periods: \n\n- Late 1800s: This period saw the emergence of mass production and the rise of large factories. Marketing was focused on selling goods produced in factories. \n\n- Early 1900s: This period saw a shift towards sales and advertising as a way to drive sales. Companies started hiring salespeople and using advertising to sell their products. \n\n- 1920s: This period saw the rise of consumer culture and the growth of retailing. Marketing became more focused on consumer demand and needs. \n\n- End of the Second World War: After the war, there was a shift towards mass consumption and a focus on persuading customers to buy more. This marked the beginning of the modern era of marketing. \n\nConsidering these timelines, we can conclude that the production period ended after the end of the Second World War. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) After the end of the Second World War.",

An attitude is a mental state that determines how an individual thinks, feels, and behaves towards some aspect of their environment. It is an evaluative belief that influences an individual's behavior and is focused on a specific object, issue or concept. An attitude can be positive, negative or neutral, and it can change over time based on a variety of factors. Therefore, an imbalance between a consumer's actual and desired state, which indicates a need for resolution, is associated with an individual's attitude towards the problem or situation they are trying to address.",
