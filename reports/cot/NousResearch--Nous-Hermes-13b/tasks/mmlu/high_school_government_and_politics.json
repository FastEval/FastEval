            "model_answer": "The correct answer is D: State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed.\n\nThis question pertains to the balance between the establishment clause and the free-exercise clause of the First Amendment. The establishment clause prohibits the government from establishing an official religion or favoring one religion over another. The free-exercise clause protects the freedom of individuals to practice their religion as they see fit.\n\nThe Supreme Court has struck a balance between these two clauses by prohibiting state-sponsored prayer during school hours, as it would constitute an establishment of religion. However, the Court has also allowed for voluntary prayer by student groups before school, as it is an exercise of religion by individuals.\n\nTherefore, answer C: Once Congress has created an administrative agency, that agency can be dissolved only by a constitutional amendment, does not relate to the balance struck by the Supreme Court between the establishment and free-exercise clauses. Similarly, answers A and B: Freedom of speech is protected except in certain situations, such as yelling \"fire\" in a crowded theater and Once a church has been recognized by the federal government, its tax-exempt status can never be revoked, do not relate to the balance struck between the establishment and free-exercise clauses.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements does NOT accurately describe voting behavior in the United States?\n\n(A) Registered voters between the ages of 35 and 45 are more likely to vote than are those under the age of 21.\n(B) A registered voter who has attained his or her General Educational Development (GED) is less likely to vote than a high school dropout.\n(C) Registered voters are more likely to vote in general elections than they are in primary elections.\n(D) More women than men have voted in every presidential election since 1980.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to compare the voting behavior of different groups of people. Let's examine each statement:\n\n(A) Registered voters between the ages of 35 and 45 are more likely to vote than are those under the age of 21.\nThis statement is accurate. People aged between 35 and 45 are considered the \"prime voter age\" because they have gained sufficient life experience and have established their careers and families. A higher proportion of this group tends to vote than others.\n\n(B) A registered voter who has attained his or her General Educational Development (GED) is less likely to vote than a high school dropout.\nThis statement is accurate. The majority of high school dropouts are less likely to vote than those who have gone on to obtain a GED or a college degree.\n\n(C) Registered voters are more likely to vote in general elections than they are in primary elections.\nThis statement is accurate. In general elections, higher percentages of registered voters participate than in primary elections. In most states, only one in three registered voters turns out for primaries.\n\n(D) More women than men have voted in every presidential election since 1980.\nThis statement is accurate. Since 1980, women have consistently outpaced men in both voter turnout and registration.\n\nTherefore, none of the statements accurately describe voting behavior in the United States. All of them provide insight into various aspects of voting behavior, but none of them accurately represent the overall pattern. This means that the answer is (D) \"More women than men have voted in every presidential election since 1980.\"",
