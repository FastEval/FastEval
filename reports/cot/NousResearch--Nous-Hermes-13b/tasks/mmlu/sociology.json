            "question": "Mass-society theory suggests that:\n\n(A) the content of the media is determined by market forces\n(B) the subordinate classes are dominated by the ideology of the ruling class\n(C) the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers\n(D) audiences make selective interpretations of media messages",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let us analyze each option separately and compare them with the concept of mass-society theory.\n\nA. The content of the media is determined by market forces: This option may not be entirely incorrect, but it is not the main focus of mass-society theory. The theory emphasizes the power of media to influence and manipulate public opinion, which makes the content persuasive, rather than being driven solely by market forces.\n\nB. The subordinate classes are dominated by the ideology of the ruling class: This option echoes the core concept of mass-society theory, which suggests that the ruling class has the power to control and shape public opinion through the media. The subordinate classes often have limited access to the media and are therefore more vulnerable to the dominant ideology.\n\nC. The media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers: This option is also in line with the mass-society theory, which argues that the media use various techniques to manipulate and influence the public. The term 'the masses' refers to the general population, who are perceived as being passive and easy to manipulate.\n\nD. Audiences make selective interpretations of media messages: This option focuses on the active role of the audience in interpreting media messages, rather than being passively influenced. While the audience may make selective interpretations, it does not detract from the overall power of the media to shape public opinion and manipulate the masses.\n\nComparing all the options, we can conclude that the answer is C. The media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers.",

We can do this by comparing each option to the information we know and eliminating those that do not fit.\n\nOption (A) suggests that cannabis use was increasing throughout all sections of youth in the 1970s. This is not Becker's claim, so we can eliminate this option.\n\nOption (B) suggests that cannabis use was learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career. This option fits Becker's claim that cannabis use is learned and becomes a part of a deviant career. So, this is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, Becker proclaimed that cannabis use was learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career.",

To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the given options.\n\nOption (A) says that this group was an urban set, involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations. This refers to the fact that many middle-class people lived in cities and were involved in civic organizations and volunteering.\n\nOption (B) states that this group was too diverse to have a strong sense of class consciousness. This suggests that the middle classes were not a cohesive group with a clear sense of their social identity.\n\nOption (C) mentions that many middle-class people were involved in 'white collar' work. This refers to the fact that many middle-class people had office jobs and were part of the growing service sector.\n\nGiven all of this information, the correct answer is (D) all of the above.

Gemeinschaft (community) is characterized by close relationships and shared values, in contrast to the weaker ties and individualism found in Gesellschaft (society).\n3. Therefore, to answer the question, we can eliminate options (A) and (D) as they do not fit with the definition of gemeinschaft.\n4. The remaining options are:\n   a. (B) mechanical solidarity - This refers to a social structure where individuals have fixed and interdependent roles within society, which can be associated with traditional or agrarian societies. This is different from the loose social structures found in Gesellschaft, and does not fit with the characteristics of gemeinschaft.\n   b. (C) gesellschaft - This refers to the concept of the modern, urban, capitalist society where individuals often maintain loose ties and are focus on their individual interests. This is the opposite of gemeinschaft, which values communal relationships and shared values.\n5. Therefore, the answer is (C) gesellschaft.

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) recognised as breaking an important norm of behaviour. \n\nReasoning:\nWhen a deviant act is normalized, it means that it is being accepted as a behavior that is not considered wrong or abnormal by society. However, this does not mean that the behavior is considered 'normal' in the sense of being typical or common. On the contrary, normalization is actually the opposite of making a behavior normal. It is when a behavior that was formerly considered deviant is recognized as breaking an important norm of behavior, rather than being conformed to or accepted as an acceptable form of behavior.
