They were not just one homogeneous group but were a collection of different social and economic groups. They were involved in 'white collar' work. They were also involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations. This involvement helped develop a sense of class consciousness among them. However, their class consciousness was not very strong due to their diversity. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) all of the above.",

This 'private' information is often shared with third parties without consent. So, option A is a consequence of technological surveillance. \n\nOption B may not be directly related to technological surveillance, but it is a consequence of advancements in technology. Electronic tagging is a means of monitoring an individual's movement using GPS technology or similar devices. This is a more effective and efficient way of monitoring an individual than traditional means of surveillance. So, option B is also a consequence of technological advancement. \n\nOption C is a direct consequence of technological surveillance. Employers often use surveillance cameras and other monitoring devices to keep track of their employees' activities at work. This ensures accountability and reduces the risk of theft or other malpractices. So, option C is a consequence of technological surveillance.\n\nTherefore, all of the above is the correct answer.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we can break it down into smaller parts and examine each part individually. \n\n1. The concept of gemeinschaft developed by Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies describes basically the same relational characteristics as\n\n2. We know that gemeinschaft refers to a form of community or group that is based on close personal relationships and a shared sense of identity and shared values.\n\n3. Now we can compare the options given and see which one most closely matches this description.\n\n4. A. Organic solidarity refers to a situation where people are bound together by a shared sense of identity and values. This is similar to gemeinschaft in that both refer to a sense of community based on shared values and identity. However, T\u00f6nnies's gemeinschaft goes beyond simple shared values and incorporates personal relationships as well. \n\n5. Therefore, we can eliminate option A.\n\n6. B. Mechanical solidarity refers to a situation where people are bound together by shared roles and practices, irrespective of their personal relationships with one another. This concept is different from gemeinschaft as it focuses more on shared practices and roles than on personal relationships and shared values. \n\n7. Therefore, we can eliminate option B.\n\n8. C. Gesellschaft refers to a form of society where individuals pursue their own individual interests and have little sense of shared identity and values. This concept is opposite to gemeinschaft as it focuses on individualism and self-interest rather than shared values and identity. \n\n9. Therefore, we can eliminate option C.\n\n10. D. Anomie refers to a situation where there is a lack of social norms and values to guide behaviour. This concept is different from gemeinschaft as it focuses more on a lack of social norms and values than on shared identity and values. \n\n11. Therefore, we can eliminate option D.\n\nBased on our analysis, the concept of gemeinschaft developed by Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies does not describe the same relational characteristics as society (D).

            "model_answer": "Answer: (C) The price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings.\n\nReasoning: Growing income inequality refers to the situation where the difference between the incomes of the rich and poor increases. Income inequality can be caused by various factors. Choice (A) rates of income tax increased equally for all occupational groups may not contribute to growing income inequality as it refers to taxation policies that affect all income groups similarly. Choice (B) there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them may not contribute to growing income inequality as it refers to a situation where there are not enough people to fill job vacancies which can lead to skill shortages rather than widening the income gap. Choice (D) growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits may contribute to growing income inequality as it refers to a situation where more people are reliant on government assistance which may not be enough to meet their basic needs leading to widening income disparities. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice (C) the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings as this factor can contribute to growing income inequality by making it harder for low-income families to afford basic necessities.",

Thus, it can be seen as a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character. However, this does not fully explain why something becomes usual or acceptable.\n(C) the first step in establishing a deviant career.\nThis option seems to be incorrect because it refers to establishing a deviant career, which means that the person will continue to engage in deviant behaviour. This contradicts the idea that something is made usual or acceptable.\n(A) recognised as breaking an important norm of behaviour.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) recognised as breaking an important norm of behaviour.",

It argues that patriarchy is not simply a matter of individual acts of discrimination, but is instead maintained by the institutional structures of society.\n\nAccording to Marxist feminism, patriarchy is based on a system of sex classes, where men are assigned power and privileges based on their gender, while women are assigned subordination and oppression. This system is supported by the economic system, which relies on women's unpaid domestic labor, as well as by the political system, which maintains gender roles and social norms that uphold patriarchy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) sex classes, through which men oppress women economically, politically and sexually.",
