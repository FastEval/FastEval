            "question": "The weight of an aspirin tablet is 300 milligrams according to the bottle label. An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim. Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(B) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n(D) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to perform a hypothesis test using a t-distribution since the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the mean weight of the aspirin tablets is 300 milligrams, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the mean weight is not 300 milligrams.\n\nUsing a t-distribution table, we find the critical value for a two-tailed test with df=6 and \u03b1=0.05 to be approximately 1.677.\n\nSince the sample mean (x\u0304) is 299.3, which is less than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis. To find the P-value, we look up the t-value in the t-distribution table that corresponds to 6 degrees of freedom and a two-tailed test with a probability of 0.05. The t-value is approximately 1.540.\n\nNow we can calculate the P-value using either (A) or (C):\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6: P(t > 1.54) \u2248 0.168\n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7: P(t > 1.54) \u2248 0.088\n\nSo, the P-value for this test is approximately 0.168. The final answer is (C). The answer is P(t > 1.54) with df = 7, which gives a P-value of 0.088.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To find the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders, we need to consider that there are 150,000 riders in the first summer. We should look for the shortest time interval that can accommodate 100,000 riders, which means we should look for the 100th percentile of the normal distribution.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the mean and standard deviation of the distribution:\n\nMean = \u00b5 = 35 minutes\nStandard deviation = \u03c3 = 10 minutes\n\nNow, let's find the z-score corresponding to the 100th percentile:\n\nz = (x - \u00b5) / \u03c3\n\nSince x = 100,000 riders, we have:\n\nz = (100,000 - 35) / 10\nz = 96,500 / 10\nz = 9,650 (Note: the actual value should be 9650, but for simplicity we're rounding up to the nearest thousand)\n\nNow, we can use the z-score to find the corresponding time interval. We'll convert the z-score to a time interval by multiplying it by the standard deviation:\n\nTime interval = \u03c3 * z\nTime interval = 10 * 9,650\nTime interval = 96,500 seconds\n\nSince there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time interval to minutes:\n\nTime interval = 96,500 / 60\nTime interval = 1,608.34 minutes\n\nSince we just need the shortest interval, we'll try to round down to the nearest whole number:\n\nTime interval = 1,608 minutes\n\nNow, we can switch to the correct unit of measurement (hours):\n\nTime interval = 1,608 minutes / 60\nTime interval = 26.8 hours\n\nSo, the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is approximately 26.8 hours. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) 25.3 to 35 minutes",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The statement that is not true is (C). Here's why:\n\n(A) is true because if there is enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis at a high significance level (10%), then surely there is enough evidence to reject it at a lower significance level (5%). This is because a higher significance level allows for more false positives.\n\n(B) is true because the choice between a one-sided and a two-sided test depends on the specific null hypothesis being tested. If the alternative hypothesis is one-sided, then a one-sided test is used. If the alternative hypothesis is two-sided, then a two-sided test is used. This decision is typically made before the data are gathered.\n\n(D) is true because the power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis, given that the null hypothesis is true. The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, and it depends on the specific null and alternative hypotheses being tested.

Power is the ability of a statistical test to detect an effect when it is present. A type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but the test rejects it, while a type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is false but the test fails to detect it. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement given in the question. The researchers are using a significance level of 0.05, which means there is a 5% chance of committing a type I error. The null hypothesis is false, which means there is a true effect. If they modify their experiment to use twice as many experimental units for each treatment, it will increase the power of their test. \n\nSince the power of the test is increasing, it is more likely to detect the true effect, whether it is a type I error or a type II error. Therefore, the probability of committing a type I error and the probability of committing a type II error would both be less than before, i.e., the probability of both type I and type II errors would decrease. \n\nHence, the correct answer is (A) The probability of a Type I error and the probability of a Type II error would both decrease.",
