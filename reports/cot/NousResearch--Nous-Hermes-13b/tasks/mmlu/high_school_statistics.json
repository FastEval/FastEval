An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim. Which of the following gives the P-value of this test?\n\n(A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(B) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6\n(C) P(t > 1.54) with df = 7\n(D) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To find the P-value, we first need to calculate the t-statistic. The formula for the t-statistic is:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nIn this case, the population mean is 300 mg, and the sample mean is the average of the weights of the seven tablets:\n\nsample mean = (299 + 300 + 305 + 302 + 299 + 301 + 303) / 7 = 1996 / 7 = 284.29 mg\n\nThe sample standard deviation can be calculated using the formula:\n\nsample standard deviation = sqrt(sum((x - sample mean)^2) / sample size)\n\nFor each weight, we calculate the difference from the sample mean, square it, and add it to the sum:\n\nsum((x - sample mean)^2) = (299 - 284.29)^2 + (300 - 284.29)^2 + (305 - 284.29)^2 + (302 - 284.29)^2 + (299 - 284.29)^2 + (301 - 284.29)^2 + (303 - 284.29)^2 = 10795\n\nNow we divide the sum by the sample size (7):\n\nsample standard deviation = sqrt(10795 / 7) = sqrt(1545.71) = 39.11 mg\n\nNow we can calculate the t-statistic:\n\nt = (284.29 - 300) / (39.11 / sqrt(7)) = -15.71 / 5.83 = -2.68\n\nWe are given the critical value for a one-tailed hypothesis test at 0.01 (1%). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find that the critical value for df = 6 (since we have 7 observations, we discard the smallest value) and t = -2.68 is approximately -1.65.\n\nSince the t-statistic (-2.68) is less than the critical value (-1.65), we reject the null hypothesis that the true mean weight of the aspirin tablets is equal to 300 mg. The P-value is the probability of obtaining a t-statistic less than -2.68, which is approximately 0.0047 or 0.47%. \n\nTherefore, the P-value for this test is 0.0047 or (0.47%).",

In a normal distribution, the median is equal to the mean. \nSo, the median for this distribution is:\nMedian = Mean = 35 minutes\n\nStep 2: Calculate the value which corresponds to 100,000 riders.\nIf the mean waiting time is 35 minutes and there are 150,000 riders, then we can assume that the sum of waiting times for 100,000 riders is also equal to 35 minutes. \nTo find the value of waiting time corresponding to 100,000 riders, we need to divide the total waiting time by the number of riders:\n100,000 riders = 35 minutes / x\nx = 34 minutes\n\nStep 3: Determine the time interval associated with 100,000 riders.\nUsing what we learned from step two, we can determine that the time interval associated with 100,000 riders is centered around 34 minutes. \nTo find the shortest time interval, we need to determine the time range that includes 100,000 riders. We can do this by subtracting 34 minutes from the median and adding it to the value we found in step two:\nShortest time interval = Median - 34 minutes + 34 minutes\nShortest time interval = 35 minutes - 34 minutes + 34 minutes\nShortest time interval = 35 minutes\n\nTherefore, the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is:\n(D) 25.3 to 35 minutes",

The degrees of freedom determine how many parameters are estimated and thus the value of df affects the shape of the distribution.\n\n2. t-distributions are bell-shaped and symmetric.\nThis is also true because t-distributions are bell-shaped and symmetric. This means that the distribution has equal chances of any value occurring at any point regardless of the mean.\n\n3. t-distributions always have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\nThis is false because the mean and standard deviation of a t-distribution depend on the value of the degrees of freedom (df).
