            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to determine which statement expresses a relationship between aging and sexual functioning. \n\nOption (D) states that aging is related to some loss of erectile rigidity in the male. While this is certainly true, it does not express a relationship between aging and sexual functioning as a whole. \n\nOption (A) states that aging is related to an increase in vaginal lubrication. This can certainly impact sexual functioning, but it is not a comprehensive statement about the relationship between aging and sexual functioning as a whole. \n\nOption (B) states that aging is associated with an increase in the frequency and number of orgasmic contractions in both sexes. This statement is more comprehensive as it discusses both sexes and multiple aspects of sexual functioning (frequency, number of contractions). Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.",

It is a statistical concept that represents the variability of a measurement process. In other words, it tells us how precise our measurements are.\n\nNow, we have a specific value for the SEM, which is 15 points. This means that roughly 68% of the observed scores for the test population lie within 15 points of the mean score. \n\nSo, the correct answer is (A).",

It does not refer to substances that can cause fetal damage. \nThirdly, we know that the first 6 weeks of pregnancy is a crucial period for fetal development, but being a problem in the first 6 weeks alone is not enough to determine the impact of a substance on fetal development. \nFinally, controlled substances can have an impact on fetal development if taken during pregnancy, but being a controlled substance alone is not enough to determine the impact on fetal development. \nTherefore, the answer is (B) A teratogen.",

It promotes a client-centered approach where the therapist helps the client become more fully functioning in their life by engaging in the present. By talking about the past, the client can gain insight into their present behaviors and thought patterns.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is A) the efficiency of controlled memory processes. This is because aging is associated with a decline in the efficiency of memory processes such as encoding, retrieval, and consolidation. Controlled memory processes refer to the conscious effort we make to remember information. This decline in efficiency can be attributed to factors such as reduced blood flow to the brain, changes in brain structure, and a decrease in neurotransmitters. As a result, older individuals may experience difficulties in remembering new information and retrieving previously learned information.",
