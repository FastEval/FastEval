            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\nThe prevalence of a disease in a population is defined as the proportion of people in the population who have the disease at a given time. Prevalence normally changes over time because people get infected or recover from the disease.\n\nAll else being constant means that nothing else is changing in the environment that could influence the prevalence of the disease.\n\nIf the incidence rate of the disease falls, it means that fewer people are getting infected with the disease. However, this does not necessarily mean that the prevalence of the disease will increase. It is possible that the number of people recovering from the disease is also decreasing, which would result in a decrease in prevalence.\n\nIf survival time with the disease increases, it means that people are living longer with the disease. This could lead to an increase in prevalence if there are more people living with the disease in the population.\n\nIf recovery of the disease is faster, it means that people are getting better from the disease faster than before. This could lead to a decrease in prevalence as more people recover from the disease and are no longer considered infected.\n\nIf the population in which the disease is measured increases, it could lead to an increase in prevalence if the number of people with the disease also increases.\n\nTaking all of this into account, the only circumstance in which the prevalence of a disease in the population will increase, all else being constant, is if the population in which the disease is measured increases.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "There are multiple causes behind the obesity epidemic. Here are some possible factors and explanations:\n\n1. Increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary lifestyle: One of the main causes of obesity is consuming more energy than we burn. With the increasing availability and accessibility of high-calorie foods and drinks, combined with the increasing prevalence of sedentary activities such as sitting at a desk all day or watching TV, people are taking in more energy than they can burn off through physical activity.\n\n2. Decreased leisure time activity: People are spending less time engaging in physical activity for fun or recreation. This can be attributed to various factors, including the rise of technology and indoor leisure activities, and a decrease in opportunities for outdoor play or organized sports.\n\n3. Changes in genetic profiles: Genetics can play a role in obesity, although it is not yet fully understood how genes contribute to the condition. It is known that certain genes can affect appetite, metabolism, and the way our bodies process and store energy. Some studies suggest that genetic factors may be more prevalent in certain populations or among families with a history of obesity.\n\n4. None of the options given is correct: None of the options provided adequately describes the main causes of the obesity epidemic. The causes are multifactorial and interrelated, involving a combination of environmental, social, and genetic factors.\n\n(A) Increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary life-style.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To solve this question, we need to match the description of a vitamin that acts as a major lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes.\n\n1. First, let's think about the properties of the vitamin we're looking for. It needs to be lipid-soluble, meaning it can dissolve in fats and oils. And it needs to be an antioxidant, meaning it can neutralize or prevent oxidation.\n\n2. Next, let's consider which vitamins are commonly found in cell membranes. The first three vitamins listed are known to be essential nutrients for humans: Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. However, not all of them are lipid-soluble. For example, Vitamin A and Vitamin D are stored in fatty tissues, but they are not lipid-soluble themselves.\n\n3. That means we need to focus on Vitamin E and Vitamin K as they are both fat-soluble. Now, let's look at their functions in the body. Vitamin E is known to have antioxidant properties, protecting cells from oxidative damage caused by free radicals. On the other hand, Vitamin K has a key role in blood clotting and bone health, but it's not considered an antioxidant.\n\n4. Therefore, the answer is (A) Vitamin A.",

The reduced secretion of intrinsic factor (A) is one of them. This is because as we age, our body produces less intrinsic factor, which is a protein needed to absorb vitamin B12 from food.\n4. Another factor is atrophic gastritis (B), a condition in which the stomach lining becomes thinner. This can decrease the production of acid, which is essential for vitamin B12 absorption.\n5. Helicobacter pylori infection (C) is also a common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency because this bacteria can damage the stomach lining and reduce acid production.\n6. Therefore, all of the above options (D) contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults.",

Elevated levels of IGF-1 are thought to contribute to the development of endometrial cancer.\n\nOestrogen is another hormone that has been linked to an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Post-menopausal women with a high body mass index (BMI) have an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer, which suggests that obesity may contribute to higher levels of oestrogen in the body.\n\nResearch has shown that oestrogen can promote the growth of endometrial cells, which can lead to the development of endometrial cancer.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the meaning of each statement. We can break down the statements and analyze their correctness step by step.\n\nStatement (A): The metabolic demand is supplied only from the diet. \nThis statement suggests that the body's need for amino acids is fulfilled solely by consuming them through food. This is partially correct, as the body cannot produce amino acids on its own, so we must obtain them from our diet. However, it does not take into account other factors such as the body's ability to store amino acids or the potential for the body to produce amino acids under certain conditions. Therefore, this statement is not entirely correct. \n\nStatement (B): The metabolic demand is to maintain protein turnover. \nThis statement is also correct but it only focuses on one aspect of the metabolic demand for amino acids. Protein turnover is the process by which the body breaks down and builds new proteins, which requires amino acids. However, there are other factors that affect the metabolic demand for amino acids such as the body's overall health and its ability to produce other essential compounds. Therefore, this statement is not entirely correct either.\n\nStatement (C): The metabolic demand involves consumption of amino-acids by a number of irreversible pathways and these are either obligatory or adaptive. \nThis statement is the most accurate of the four options. The metabolic demand for amino acids involves more than just maintaining protein turnover. There are a number of irreversible pathways in which amino acids are consumed, such as the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, the production of certain neurotransmitters, and the synthesis of heme. These pathways are either obligatory (a requirement for survival) or adaptive (depend on cellular or physiological circumstances). Therefore, this statement is the most accurate.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct statement is (C) The metabolic demand involves consumption of amino-acids by a number of irreversible pathways and these are either obligatory or adaptive.",

The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children.\n\nReasoning:\nOut of the given options, only one directly talks about the amino acid requirements of human nutrition. Option (D) states that the amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children.\n\nThere is no doubt that amino acids are essential for human health and wellbeing. However, the requirements for amino acids and their distribution vary at different stages of life. For example, infants and young children have different requirements for amino acids as compared to adults, as their bodies are still developing and growing.\n\nOn the other hand, option (A) talks about assuming the amino acid requirements for adults as the requirement pattern for all ages, which is not accurate as the requirements may vary depending on age and other factors. Similarly, options (B) and (C) also do not directly address the amino acid requirements of humans.\n\nTherefore, option (D) is the correct answer.",
