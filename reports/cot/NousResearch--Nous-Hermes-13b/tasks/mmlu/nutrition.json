            "model_answer": "A food culture study was conducted in the UK in 2020, and the results showed that in Wales and Scotland, there is a lower consumption of fruits and vegetables as compared to other parts of the UK. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Fruits and vegetables. As for the other options: (A) Meat is quite popular in the UK, including Wales and Scotland. (B) Confectionery is also consumed in varying quantities in the UK, but there are no specific areas where it is consumed in lower quantities. (D) Potatoes are staple foods in Wales and Scotland, and while their consumption may have decreased in recent years, they are not considered to be consumed in lower quantities as of 2020.",

            "model_answer": "My reasoning:\nD is incorrect because the prevalence of a disease refers to the number of individuals living with the disease at a given time, whereas increasing the population would increase the number of people potentially at risk of getting the disease. (A) is incorrect because an increase in the incidence rate of the disease would cause the prevalence to increase, while all else being constant would mean that recovery and survival time remain the same. (C) is incorrect because if recovery of the disease is faster, it would mean there are fewer individuals living with the disease but still experiencing symptoms at any given time, which would decrease the prevalence.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "After analyzing the possible causes of the obesity epidemic, the most significant contributing factor appears to be (A) Increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary life-style. This means that people consume more calories than they burn through physical activity, and they are often sitting for extended periods of time. In addition to this, there are also other factors such as (B) Decreased leisure time activity, because people spend less time engaging in physical activities for fun or exercise. (C) Changes in genetic profiles has also been identified as a contributing factor, but it is not considered the primary cause.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider which vitamin is a lipid-soluble antioxidant that is found in cell membranes. This can help us narrow down the options. \n\nVitamin A, while important, is not a lipid-soluble antioxidant but rather a fat-soluble vitamin that functions mainly as an antioxidant in fatty tissues and the blood. \n\nVitamin D, while also important, does not function as a lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes. \n\nVitamin E is a well-known lipid-soluble antioxidant, but it is not found specifically in cell membranes. It is found mainly in the blood plasma and body tissues. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Vitamin E.",

            "model_answer": "A and B are both factors that contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults. \n\n(A) Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor: As people age, their stomachs produce less intrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. \n\n(B) Atrophic gastritis: This condition, which is common in older adults, damages the lining of the stomach and reduces its ability to produce the acid needed to absorb vitamin B12. \n\nTherefore, both (A) and (B) are correct answers.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Oestrogen. \n\nObesity is thought to increase the risk of endometrial cancer by increasing oestrogen levels in the body. Oestrogen, a hormone produced primarily in the ovaries, is involved in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system. High levels of oestrogen can lead to the development of endometrial hyperplasia, a condition where the lining of the uterus becomes too thick. Over time, this can lead to endometrial cancer. Therefore, oestrogen is thought to mediate the increased risk of endometrial cancer in obese individuals.",
