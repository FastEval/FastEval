These networks consist of several convolutional layers, which extract features from the input image and pass them to the next layer. Convolutional networks are also widely used in state-of-the-art image classification models like ResNet, VGG, and Inception.\n\n(B) graph networks: Graph networks are useful for analyzing structured data, such as social networks or molecular graphs. While they can be used for image classification, their main strength lies in their ability to handle complex relationships between data points. In 2020, they are not the best choice for classifying high-resolution images.\n\n(C) fully connected networks: Fully connected networks consist of a large number of neurons in the output layer, allowing them to learn complex mappings between input and output data. However, they require a large amount of training data and computational power. While they can be used for image classification, they are not the most efficient choice for high-resolution images.\n\n(D) RBF networks: Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks are a type of kernel-based machine learning algorithm, known for their simplicity and effectiveness on non-linear problems.

Let's start with statement 1: The log-likelihood of the data will always increase through successive iterations of the expectation maximation algorithm. \n4. To evaluate this statement, we need to understand the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. \n5. EM is an iterative algorithm used to estimate parameters of hidden Markov models. \n6. On each iteration, EM updates the parameters based on the current data and the parameters from the previous iteration. \n7. The log-likelihood of the data is the logarithm of the likelihood of the data given the model parameters. \n8. The log-likelihood will increase as the model parameters are updated. \n9.

The algorithm uses a reward function to evaluate the quality of an action in a particular state. \n14. Q-learning updates the Q values of actions based on the difference between the expected future reward and the actual reward. \n15. The learner can learn a good policy without prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment. \n16.

This is a basic property of probability distributions and is true for all continuous random variables.\n2. Decision tree is learned by minimizing information gain. This is a well-known fact in machine learning.
