For example, if a complex dataset with many subtle patterns is being used, then higher-order polynomial kernels may not necessarily change the support vectors significantly compared to linear kernels.

They have shown great success in tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and image classification.\n\nGraph networks (B) have also been explored for image classification tasks, but they are less popular than convolutional networks.

Fully connected networks are good at handling classification tasks with many classes, but they require a large amount of data to learn effective representations and are prone to overfitting.\n\nRBF networks (D) are a type of kernel-based network that can be used for image classification tasks.

It says that for any continuous random variable x, its probability distribution function p(x) must satisfy the condition that 0 \u2264 p(x) \u2264 1 for all x.
