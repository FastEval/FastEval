            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To solve this question, we need to find the credible source that provides information on the credit rating of retail businesses.\n\nWe can start by breaking down the information provided in the question: \n\n1. It's about retail businesses, so we can eliminate ('D') as it relates to the credit rating of utility companies.\n2. It mentions no specific date or time, so we can disregard any associations that were not existing during that time.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\n(A) The Retail Merchants Association: This association represents retailers and is involved in lobbying and advocacy for the retail industry. However, it might not provide information on credit ratings of retail businesses as its primary function is not credit evaluation.\n\n(B) The local chamber of commerce: It is a non-profit organization that promotes businesses growth and development in local communities. It could provide information on credit ratings of retail businesses in the area but it's not a national source.\n\n(C) Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.: This is a commercial entity that provides business information on creditworthiness, credit standing etc. hence it is a likely candidate to provide information on credit ratings of retail businesses.\n\n(D) The United States Retail Credit Association: This association represents retail credit executives and acts as a national. However, it might not provide information on credit ratings of retail businesses.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the credible source that provides information on the credit rating of retail businesses is (C) Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. \n\n(A) \n(B) \n(C) \n(D)",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The instructional strategy described in the question is (D) Introduction-Body-Conclusion strategy. \n\nHere's why:\n\nThe instructional strategy involves presenting students with examples of short stories and working with them to identify defining characteristics of the genre. This suggests that the teacher is using a structured approach to guide students through the process of understanding short stories.\n\nThe fact that the teacher is presenting examples and working with students to identify characteristics indicates that the teacher is using a direct, explicit approach to instruction, rather than an exploratory or inquiry-based approach.\n\nThe identification of defining characteristics suggests that there is a specific goal or objective that the teacher is trying to achieve with the instruction, which is consistent with a structured, directed approach to instruction such as the Introduction-Body-Conclusion strategy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Introduction-Body-Conclusion strategy.",

When we burn paper, it goes through different stages of combustion. First stage is ignition at around 450 degrees Fahrenheit.\n3. Second stage is the flaming combustion at around 700-800 degrees Fahrenheit.\n4. Third stage is the smouldering combustion at around 1100-1200 degrees Fahrenheit.\n5. Final stage is the cold ash at around 1400-1700 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n6. The temperature at which paper burns depends on various factors like the material, thickness, humidity etc.\n7. Generally, paper ignites at around 450 degrees Fahrenheit and burns completely at around 800-1200 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n8. Out of the given options, (A) 986 degrees is the lowest temperature mentioned, which is the temperature at which paper does its first stage ignition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 986 degrees Fahrenheit.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to break it down into smaller parts. We know that we are looking for the first names of two early American explorers, and we also know that their last name was \"Lewis\" and \"Clark.\" \n\nSo, we can start by trying to list down the famous early American explorers. One of the most famous is Christopher Columbus, but he doesn't fit the criteria as he did not explore America. The same goes for other famous explorers such as Henry Hudson and Jacques Cartier. Eventually, we come across explorers who did explore America, such as John Cabot, Christopher Columbus' son, and his crew, and we know for sure that John Cabot was not part of the Lewis and Clark expedition, so we need to look for someone else.\n\nThe next person comes to mind is Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, who were commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson to explore the Louisiana Territory, which today is part of the United States. So, we can safely say that the first names of the early American explorers Lewis and Clark are Meriwether and William.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) Meriwether and William.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine which material has the least affected resistance by temperature changes, we need to consider the temperature coefficient of resistivity for each material. \n\nCopper (A) has a temperature coefficient of resistivity of around 1.6 x 10^-4 /\u00b0C. This means that its resistance will change slightly as temperature increases or decreases.\n\nCarbon (B) has a temperature coefficient of resistivity of around 2.3 x 10^-3 /\u00b0C. This means that its resistance will change more than copper when temperature increases or decreases.\n\nGermanium (C) has a temperature coefficient of resistivity of around 6.5 x 10^-3 /\u00b0C. This means that its resistance will change even more than carbon when temperature increases or decreases.\n\nSilicon (D) has a temperature coefficient of resistivity of around 3.8 x 10^-3 /\u00b0C. This means that its resistance will change even more than germanium when temperature increases or decreases.\n\nSince all materials have a positive temperature coefficient of resistivity, which means their resistance increases with increasing temperature, the material that has the least affected resistance by temperature changes is the one with the lowest temperature coefficient of resistivity.\n\nTherefore, the material that has a resistance that is least affected by temperature changes is NOT Copper (A), NOT Carbon (B), NOT Germanium (C), and NOT Silicon (D), but rather any materials with a temperature coefficient of resistivity of less than 6.5 x 10^-3 /\u00b0C, or in other words, a materials with a resistivity that changes very little with temperature.",
