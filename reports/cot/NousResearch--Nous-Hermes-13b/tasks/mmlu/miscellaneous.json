Discipline-based inquiry\n\nExplanation:\nThis instructional strategy involves presenting students with various examples of short stories and working with them to identify defining characteristics of the genre. This process requires the students to engage with the content and actively participate in the learning process, which is characteristic of discipline-based inquiry. It moves beyond rote memorization and encourages deeper understanding and analysis of the material.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Resistance is affected by temperature changes because the thermal vibrations of the atoms in the material can cause more or less contact between the current-carrying electrons and the atoms, which in turn affects the resistance. \n\nComparing the given materials:\n\nCopper has relatively low thermal coefficient of resistance, meaning that it's resistance does not change much with temperature changes. However, it is still affected by temperature changes. The less affected by temperature changes would need to have a low thermal coefficient of resistance.\n\nCarbon generally has a higher thermal coefficient of resistance than copper, meaning that it's resistance changes more with temperature changes.\n\nGermanium has an even higher thermal coefficient of resistance than carbon, meaning that it's resistance changes even more with temperature changes.\n\nSilicon has a higher thermal coefficient of resistance than germanium, meaning that it's resistance changes even more with temperature changes.\n\nTherefore, the material with a resistance that is least affected by temperature changes is copper (A).",

Matt Damon, Dustin Hoffman, and Ben Affleck are all established actors who have played significant roles in various films over the years. So, they are all valid answers. However, Jude Law has also had a successful acting career, so he too could be a valid answer.\n\nHowever, before we can determine who does or does not play 'Mr. Ripley' in the film, we need more information. We would need to know the character's full name, or some additional context about the film or the actor's performance, in order to make a determination. \n\nTherefore, without more information, we cannot definitively answer the question.",
