            "model_answer": "To determine what is true for a type-Ia supernova, we need to gather information about their characteristics and properties. Type-Ia supernovae are used as standard candles in cosmology because they have a consistent peak luminosity. This means that for a given redshift, the absolute magnitude of a Type-Ia supernova can be used as a standard reference to calculate the distance of the host galaxy.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) This type occurs in binary systems - False, Type-Ia supernovae are not exclusive to binary systems.\n\n(B) This type occurs in young galaxies - True, Type-Ia supernovae are commonly found in young galaxies, as they are kept fuelled with new supply of hydrogen via star formation.\n\n(C) This type produces gamma-ray bursts - True, A small fraction of Type-Ia supernovae are accompanied by gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which are extremely energetic explosions.\n\n(D) This type produces high amounts of X-rays - True, Type-Ia supernovae are amongst the brightest sources of X-rays in the universe, as they emit large amounts of X-rays when they explode.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is true for a type-Ia supernova is (B) This type occurs in young galaxies.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is D) Its distance from you. \n\nExplanation: \nIf you know both the actual brightness of an object and its apparent brightness from your location, you can use the inverse square law of light to estimate its distance from you. The inverse square law states that the intensity of light diminishes with the square of the distance from the light source. \nSo, if the apparent brightness of an object is half of its actual brightness, it means that the distance between you and the object is twice the distance it would have been if it were at its actual brightness. Therefore, the object is twice as far away as it would have been if it were at its actual brightness.\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D) Its distance from you.",

            "model_answer": "A) Because the molecules that compose the Earth's atmosphere have a blue-ish color\n\nReasoning:\nThe sky appears blue because it is the color that our eyes perceive when sunlight is scattered by the atmosphere. The blue color is due to the fact that the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, more than other colors like red and yellow. When the short-wavelength light reaches our eyes, it appears blue because the Earth's atmosphere has a blue-ish color.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) After you\u2019ve repeated your experiment many times. \n\nThe reason why is because a single experiment or observation is not enough to prove a scientific theory. A theory needs to be tested and verified multiple times by different scientists to establish its validity. This helps to rule out any chance of chance or error, and ensures that the theory is based on robust and reliable evidence. Therefore, only after repeating the experiment many times can we be confident that the theory is correct.",

The atmosphere of Titan is composed mostly of hydrocarbons, such as methane and ethane. \n\n3. Titan is also the only moon known to have a significant atmosphere and the only object in the solar system, other than Earth, to have stable bodies of liquid on its surface. \n\n4.

            "question": "A comet of mass m impacts the earth (mass M radius R) at the minimum impact speed. What is the expression for the total energy released in the impact?\n\n(A) m*v\n(B) 0.5*m/(R^3)\n(C) 0.5*m*(2GM/R)\n(D) 0.6*G(M^2)/R",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To find the total energy released in the impact, we need to consider the kinetic energy of the comet before impact, which will be converted into other forms of energy, such as thermal energy, sound energy, and potential energy.\n\n1. First, we need to find the minimum impact speed, which is the point where the comet's gravitational potential energy is at its maximum and kinetic energy is at its minimum. This occurs when the comet is at the same altitude as its perigee. \n\n2. To find the minimum impact speed, we can use the following formula: v = sqrt(2GM/R), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, and R is the radius of the Earth.\n\n3. Now, we need to find the kinetic energy of the comet before impact, which is given by the formula 0.5*m*v^2, where m is the mass of the comet and v is its speed.\n\n4. The total energy released in the impact will be the sum of the energy in the comet's kinetic energy and the energy converted into other forms of energy. This can be expressed as:\n\nTotal energy = 0.5*m*(v+v_impact)^2 - 0.5*m*v^2\n\n5. At the minimum impact speed, the comet's kinetic energy is at its minimum, so we can set this equal to zero:\n\n0.5*m*(v+v_impact)^2 - 0.5*m*v^2 = 0\n\n6. This simplifies to:\n\n0.5*m*(v_impact)^2 = 0.5*m*v^2\n\n7. We know that v_impact = sqrt(2GM/R), so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n0.5*m*(sqrt(2GM/R))^2 = 0.5*m*(2GM/R)*v\n\n8. Now we need to solve for the total energy released:\n\n0.5*m*(2GM/R)*v = 0.5*m*v^2\n\n9. Divide both sides by 0.5*m*v:\n\n(2GM/R) = v\n\n10. Substitute v = sqrt(2GM/R) back into this equation:\n\n(2GM/R) = sqrt(2GM/R)\n\n11. Take the square root of both sides:\n\n(2GM/R^1.5) = M\n\n12. Finally, substitute v = sqrt(2GM/R) and v_impact = sqrt(2GM/R) back into the equation for the total energy released:\n\nTotal energy = 0.5*m*(v+v_impact)^2 - 0.5*m*v^2\n\n13. Simplify:\n\nTotal energy = m*(sqrt(2GM/R)-sqrt(2GM/R))^2\n\n14. Note that the two expressions inside the parentheses cancel out:\n\nTotal energy = 0\n\nTherefore, the answer (D) 0.6*G(M^2)/R is incorrect. The correct answer is (A) m*v.",

We know that some of the water is frozen in the soil and ice caps, and some was lost due to solar wind stripping. However, the majority of the water is thought to have been lost through another mechanism. We can eliminate options (A), (C), and (B) because they either have no relevance to the question or they would account for only a small portion of the lost water.\n\nOption (D) states that the lost water was vaporized during a period of intense volcanism and was lost to space through thermal escape.

            "model_answer": "Reasoning: \nThe Moon has no atmosphere, weather, or plate tectonics to erode and weather away rocks as happens on Earth. Therefore, the Moon's surface cannot be more heavily eroded than the Earth's surface. Additionally, while lunar samples were radioactive when brought back to Earth, that does not automatically mean that they are older than Earth rocks. The Moon's rocks may have formed at the same time as Earth rocks but been ejected to the Moon during a giant impact, and thus are not truly older. \nTherefore, the best evidence for the Moon's surface rocks being older than the Earth's surface is (B) radioactive dating of lunar samples showing they are older.",
