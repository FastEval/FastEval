            "model_answer": "D) Its distance from you.\n\nExplanation:\nIf you know both the actual brightness of an object and its apparent brightness from your location, you cannot determine its speed relative to you (A) because brightness is not directly related to an object's speed.\n\nYou also cannot determine its composition (B) using brightness alone, as brightness is not a direct indicator of an object's composition.\n\nThe size of an object cannot be estimated using brightness either, as brightness is not directly related to an object's size.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining option is to estimate the distance of the object from you (D). The distance can be estimated using the inverse square law, which states that the brightness of an object is inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the observer. If you know the actual brightness of the object and its apparent brightness from your location, you can use this law to estimate the distance between you and the object.",

These molecules and particles can bounce the light around in different directions, which is called scattering. \n\nWhat is interesting about this scattering is that it tends to preferentially scatter the shorter, blue wavelengths of light more than the longer, red wavelengths. As a result, the sky appears blue. \n\nTo summarize: (C) Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To find the total energy released in the impact, we need to first determine the final velocity of the comet after impact. The impact energy will be conserved, and will be equal to the kinetic energy of the comet after impact. \n\nLet's denote the initial velocity of the comet as vi. The final velocity (vf) will be less than or equal to twice the escape velocity (vel) of the Earth, which is given by:\n\nvel = sqrt(2GM/R)\n\nThe total energy released (E) will be equal to the impact energy, which is equal to the difference between the initial kinetic energy (KEi) and the final kinetic energy (KEf) of the comet:\n\nE = KEi - KEf\n\nNow, let's find the expressions for KEi and KEf:\n\nKEi = 0.5*m*vi^2                    (1)\nKEf = 0.5*m*vf^2                    (2)\n\nSince the comet cannot have negative kinetic energy, we know that:\n\nvf^2 <= vi^2                          (3)\n\nNow, let's consider the two extreme cases:\n\nCase 1: The comet completely disintegrates on impact\nIn this case, the final velocity (vf) will be 0. This means that the kinetic energy of the comet after impact (KEf) will also be 0. According to equation (2), this means that the initial kinetic energy (KEi) of the comet must also be 0. However, this is not possible, as a comet cannot have 0 velocity. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 2: The comet bounces back without dispersing\nIn this case, the initial and final velocities of the comet will be the same (vi = vf). This means that the kinetic energy of the comet before impact (KEi) will be equal to the kinetic energy of the comet after impact (KEf), which means that the total energy released (E) will be equal to 0.\n\nHowever, we know that a comet cannot bounce back without dispersing. Therefore, this case is also not possible.\n\nThe only remaining case is when the comet partially disperses upon impact. In this case, we can consider a fraction (x) of the initial mass (m) to disperse and the remaining (1-x) to form a crater. The final velocity (vf) of the comet will then be less than twice the escape velocity of the Earth.\n\nThe mass of the earth is M, its radius is R, and the gravitational constant G is:\n\nG = 6.6743e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2\n\nThe mass of the comet after dispersing is:\n\nm_comet_after = m * x\n\nThe change in kinetic energy of the comet after dispersing is:\n\n\u0394KE = KEf - KEi = x * 0.5 * m * vi^2\n\nNow, we can use equations (1) and (2) to find the expressions for KEi and KEf:\n\nKEi = 0.5 * m * vi^2\nKEf = 0.5 * m_comet_after * vf^2\n\nWe can also find the change in gravitational potential energy of the comet after dispersing:\n\n\u0394U_grav = G * M * (m_comet_after - m) / R\n\nUsing the conservation of energy (E = KE + U_grav):\n\nE = \u0394KE + \u0394U_grav\n\nSubstituting the expressions for KE, \u0394KE, KEf, vf, m_comet_after, vi, vf, G, M, and R:\n\nE = x * 0.5 * m * vi^2 + G * M * (m_comet_after - m) / R\n\nThis is the final expression for the total energy released in the impact of a comet with mass m and radius R on the earth (mass M and radius R).",

This means that there must be a mechanism that caused the majority of the original water to be lost.\n\n2. The magnetic field of Mars is not strong enough to strip away large amounts of water.\n\n3. UV light can break hydrogen and oxygen bonds, but on Mars, only a small portion of the water would have been broken into hydrogen and oxygen. Most of the water would have been bound up in solid ice or adsorbed into minerals.\n\n4. There is no evidence of a civilization of thirsty Martians on Mars.\n\n5. Mars has experienced intense volcanic activity in the past, which could have vaporized water and lost it to space through thermal escape.
