In the Albany, New York, market, one of your products has recently been found to have some contamination. While apparently not fatal, it has given a large number of consumers severe stomach cramps and other intestinal problems. The cause has been traced back to your product, which is sold throughout the nation. Your CEO wants to know what you would advise to keep the situation from becoming a public relations disaster. What should you recommend?\n\n(A) Quickly investigate to make certain your product is definitely the cause of the illness.\n(B) Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product.\n(C) Stop sales of the product in the Albany, New York, market and issue a recall for that product.\n(D) Issue a press release to the Albany, New York, market explaining how to treat the symptoms.",

            "model_answer": "You should recommend Option A: Quickly investigate to make certain your product is definitely the cause of the illness, followed by Option B: Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product. This would be the best course of action to prevent the situation from becoming a public relations disaster. By quickly investigating the issue and stopping sales of the product nationwide, you can prevent any further instances of illness and protect the health and safety of consumers. Additionally, by issuing a recall, you are taking responsibility for the issue and showing that you value the well-being of your customers. Finally, Option D: Issuing a press release to the Albany, New York, market explaining how to treat the symptoms, would not be an appropriate response as it does not address the root cause of the problem or take action to prevent further instances of illness.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to identify the key focus of public relations. This is often characterized by the old adage, \"good news doesn't travel far unless it is carried by agents\". Therefore, an important aspect of public relations is to create positive news or to manage and control the flow of information to the public. With this in mind, it stands to reason that an organization's ability to create a positive experience for its consumers would fall under the realm of public relations. So, the answer is (B) consumer relations.",

            "model_answer": "The spiral of silence is best defined as (B) When people hide their opinions if they do not agree with the majority. \n\nThis is because the spiral of silence theory suggests that individuals are more likely to express their opinions when they believe they are in agreement with the majority. If they perceive that their views are not widely held, they may hesitate to speak out, fearing rejection or social isolation. This hesitation can then lead to a further decrease in the expression of alternative opinions, reinforcing the perception that the majority view is the correct one.",
