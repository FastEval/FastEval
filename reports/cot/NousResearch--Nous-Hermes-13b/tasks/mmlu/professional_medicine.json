            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "Based on the given information, the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is (C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. This is because the patient has a history of a hematoma in the left thigh that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. The symptom of tingling and numbness in the left thigh started after she was discharged from the hospital and has improved somewhat during the past week. The only medication she is taking is warfarin, which could cause bleeding, but it is not known if it is related to the current symptom. Cerebral infarction during hospitalization and complication of IVC filter placement are ruled out by the absence of any neurological symptoms or signs. Hematoma of the left thigh could cause compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, but it is not the most likely cause as it refers to a current or ongoing issue, while the patient's symptom has improved in the past week. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.",

She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is (D) primary dysfunctional labor. \n\nThe patient is in active labor with regular contractions every 4 minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. This suggests that the labor is not progressing smoothly and may be dysfunctional. \n\nThe examination also shows that the cervix is fully effaced and dilated, which indicates that the cervix is primed and ready for labor. The fact that the patient has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours also supports the diagnosis of dysfunctional labor. \n\nLower uterine retraction or hypotonic uterine dysfunction are less likely given the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Braxton Hicks contractions are also less likely given the regular contractions the patient was experiencing earlier. \n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary dysfunctional labor.",

His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04).

            "question": "Six healthy subjects participate in a study of muscle metabolism during which hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia is induced.

The increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits which of the following processes in these subjects?\n\n(A) Fatty acid oxidation\n(B) Fatty acid synthesis\n(C) Gluconeogenesis\n(D) Glycogenolysis",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the physiological context and the effects of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia on muscle metabolism. \n\nDuring hyperglycemia, there is an increased glucose concentration in the blood. Insulin, the primary hormone responsible for regulating glucose homeostasis, is also elevated in response to hyperglycemia. Insulin promotes glucose uptake into cells and stimulates glucose metabolism through gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. \n\nThe increased insulin levels during hyperinsulinemia further amplify these metabolic actions. \n\nGiven this context, the most likely process that would be inhibited by the increased malonyl-CoA concentration is fatty acid oxidation. Malonyl-CoA is a key regulatory molecule in fatty acid metabolism and is an essential intermediate in the synthesis of fatty acids. When malonyl-CoA levels are high, fatty acid synthesis is favored over fatty acid oxidation. In the presence of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, fatty acid oxidation is not a priority metabolic pathway, and thus, it is likely that the increased malonyl-CoA concentration directly inhibits fatty acid oxidation in these subjects. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Fatty acid oxidation.",
