We know that aesthetics deals with the study of beauty and forms, so the choices that involve unimportant or rarely viewed objects do not fit. \nStep 6: Determine the remaining answer that fits the opposite of the subject. \nThe answer is (C) not essential to our existence.",

He believed that one should constantly question and examine their beliefs and values in order to lead a fulfilling life. To Socrates, an unexamined life would mean that one is not aware of their own beliefs and values, which could lead to contradictions and inconsistencies in their actions. This lack of self-awareness could result in harm to oneself and others. Therefore, the best option to complete the sentence is (A) the state.",

One of the main arguments against skepticism is the problem of criterion, which questions the standards used to establish the doubts. This is where linguistic confusions come in. Since language is used to express our beliefs, any confusion or inconsistency in language can lead to doubts about knowledge.
