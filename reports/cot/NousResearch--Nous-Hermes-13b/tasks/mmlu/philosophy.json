This is because aesthetics deals with the appreciation and study of beauty, which is subjective and can vary from one person to another. However, the fact remains that people tend to develop an appreciation for certain things that are pleasing to the senses, and these things often play a fundamental role in their lives.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to remember that Socrates was a philosopher who believed in examining one's life and seeking truth. An unexamined life would mean a life not lived with intention or awareness, which could lead to harm. Therefore, we can conclude that an unexamined life is a tragedy because it can result in grievous harm to the soul. We should choose the option (D) the soul as the appropriate answer.",

The word \"logically\" in option (C) is also not necessary because the argument is not about if the skeptical arguments are logically consistent or not. \n\nIn option (D), Nagel might agree that skeptical arguments apply ordinary standards consistently, but this does not negate the fact that they are based on linguistic confusions. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is (B) \"are based on linguistic confusions.\"",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) establish the principles of justice for the basic structure of society.\n\nReasoning: Rawls' theory of justice is based on the concept of a hypothetical original contract between rational, equal parties. This contract is meant to establish the principles of justice for the basic structure of society. The options given do not align with this idea. Option (A) mentions entering a society, but Rawls' theory is about creating a society based on justice from scratch, rather than joining an existing one. Option (B) focuses on setting up a particular form of government, which is not a key aspect of Rawls' theory. Option (D) refers to establishing the content of morality, which is not directly related to the principles of justice that Rawls' theory is concerned with. Therefore, the best option to choose is (C) establish the principles of justice for the basic structure of society.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) drastic changes to both our personal habits and to our society.\n\nHere is the explanation step-by-step:\n\nSinger's principle is based on the idea that we have a moral obligation to help those who are in need. This means that we need to make significant changes in our behavior, both personally and societally, to address the problems of poverty and inequality. \n\nOption (A) modest changes to our personal habits, but not to our society as a whole, does not align with Singer's philosophy as it presupposes that individuals can maintain their current lifestyle without making significant changes. Singer believes that individuals must make significant changes in their personal habits in order to address injustice.\n\nOption (C) drastic changes to our personal habits, but not to our society, is closer to Singer's philosophy. However, it is not the correct answer because it does not account for changes in society as a whole. Singer believes that significant changes are needed in both our personal habits and in society as a whole in order to confront the issue of poverty and inequality.\n\nOption (B) modest changes to our personal habits, as well as to society, may sound appealing but it is not the correct answer because it presupposes that individuals can maintain their current lifestyle without making significant changes. Singer's philosophy demands for radical changes in our behavior, both personally and societally, to address the problem of poverty and inequality.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) drastic changes to both our personal habits and to our society.",
