            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) Blackbox.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Generational fuzzers typically create a limited number of mutations during the initial fuzzing phase and then try to explore the generated mutants in depth. However, there is no guarantee that they will explore every line of code.\n\n2. Whitebox fuzzers report coverage information about the target program, which means that they can potentially explore every line of code. However, they rely on the availability of meaningful input strings and may not be able to handle every line of code.\n\n3. Mutation-based fuzzers generate a large number of mutants by applying random mutations to an input seed. This approach can potentially explore every line of code but may have a limited exploration depth.\n\n4. Blackbox fuzzers do not rely on any knowledge of the target program's source code or structure. They typically exercise the target program by generating random inputs and exploring the program's behavior. This approach is considered more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the target program, including paths that may have been overlooked by other fuzzing techniques.",

An attacker impersonating the server.\n\n(A) True, True\n(B) False, False\n(C) True, False\n(D) False, True\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\nTLS protection is achieved through two main mechanisms: encryption and authentication.\n\n1. Encryption: TLS protects against an attacker intercepting and reading the client's or server's traffic by encrypting it. This is achieved through the use of various encryption algorithms and keys, which are negotiated during the session establishment. Since the client and server have a shared secret key, it becomes difficult for an attacker to decrypt the traffic without knowing the key.\n\n2. Authentication: TLS also protects against an attacker impersonating the server and compromising the client's or server's confidentiality. This is achieved through the use of digital certificates. When the client connects to the server, it verifies the server's certificate to make sure it is the legitimate server. Further, during the session establishment, the client and server execute a Diffie-Hellman exchange to generate a shared secret key. This ensures that only the client and server know the key, making it difficult for an attacker to impersonate the server.\n\nTherefore, TLS protects against an attacker impersonating the server and intercepting and reading the client's or server's traffic.",

What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets. \n\nThe maximum ticket lifetime setting on the KDC server ensures that a Kerberos ticket can only be used for a specific amount of time, after which it expires and cannot be used by the client to authenticate to network resources. When an expired ticket is presented, the KDC server will not establish a new connection between the client and the server, effectively blocking the user from accessing the resource until they obtain a new valid ticket. This ensures security and integrity of the authentication process.",

If this data is executed or written to memory, it could lead to a security breach or other malicious behavior. \n\nApplications developed in languages like C, C++ have a reputation for being prone to buffer-overflow attacks because these languages, unlike others, do not have built-in string-boundary checking functions. In other words, predefined functions in C, C++ do not have any mechanisms to automatically check if a string goes beyond its limit in a buffer. \n\nAs a result, it is up to the programmer to write code that checks the boundaries of strings before writing to the buffer. However, this is often an error-prone process, especially if the programmer is inexperienced or does not fully understand the logic of the code.
