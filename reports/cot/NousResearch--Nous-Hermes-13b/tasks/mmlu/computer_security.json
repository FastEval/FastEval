            "model_answer": "The most suitable option to explore paths covering every line of code in this program is (D) Mutation-based fuzzing. \n\nReasoning: \nIn mutation-based fuzzing, the input is mutated in a controlled manner to explore the code coverage. This can potentially expose edge cases and vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. In contrast, generational fuzzing and blackbox fuzzing focus on generating test cases based on partial information of the program.\n\nWhitebox fuzzing also explores paths covering every line of code but it requires knowledge of the code structure and function of the program. This approach can be less effective for finding vulnerabilities compared to mutation-based fuzzing if the code is complex and the understanding of the whitebox tester is limited.",

The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn MIT's Kerberos KDC server, a maximum ticket lifetime of 24 hours is set for most user principals. This means that after 24 hours, the ticket expires and becomes invalid. When a client tries to connect to a server using an expired ticket, the KDC server refuses to establish a new connection between the client and the server, thus ensuring that the expired ticket can no longer be used.",

Ben Bitdiddle notes that NaCl uses Intel x86 segmentation to ensure that the sandboxed module does not read or write memory outside its own data area, and does not execute instructions outside its own code. Ben thinks that with these restrictions alone, executing the sandboxed module must be safe; that is, he thinks validation is not needed. Ben is wrong.

            "model_answer": "To solve this question, we need to analyze the statement made by Ben Bitdiddle and understand the restrictions that NaCl imposes on the sandboxed module. \n\nFrom the given statement, we can infer that NaCl uses Intel x86 segmentation to ensure that the sandboxed module does not read or write memory outside its own data area. This means that the code within the sandboxed module is only allowed to access a specific segment of memory which is designated for it.\n\nAdditionally, we are told that NaCl also imposes a restriction on the sandboxed module to not execute instructions outside its own code. This means that the code within the sandboxed module is only allowed to execute instructions that fall within its designated code segment.\n\nHowever, Ben thinks that with these restrictions alone, executing the sandboxed module must be safe, and validation is not needed. This is where we need to disagree with Ben. Just because the sandboxed module is restricted from accessing certain segments of memory or executing instructions outside its designated code segment, it does not mean that it is safe to run without validation.\n\nTo validate the sandboxed module, we need to look for specific types of x86 machine instructions that the validator always forbids in sandboxed code. We are given the following options to choose from:\n\n(A) all instructions that modify segment state\n(B) all loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32\n(C) all indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable)\n(D) all indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable)\n\nBased on the information provided in the statement, we can eliminate options (A) and (D) as they are not related to modifying memory segments or accessing unauthorized segments of memory.\n\nNow, we are left with options (B) and (C). Both of these options involve accessing memory, which is related to the restriction on accessing only the designated memory segment. We can conclude that validation is necessary to ensure that the sandboxed module does not try to access unauthorized segments of memory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) all loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) No string boundary checks in predefined functions.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBuffer-overflow is a common security vulnerability in computer programs that is caused by writing or copying too much data into a buffer (a region of memory) that is too small. In languages like C and C++, the programmers have to be very careful when dealing with strings because the comparison of strings is done using a single character and counting the number of characters. Thus, any string that is larger than the buffer will cause the rest of the characters to be stored in other memory locations, leading to unexpected behavior or even code execution with higher privileges. This can happen when a program fails to check for string boundaries before using pointers to access data in memory. By incorporating string boundary checks in predefined functions, the possibility of buffer-overflow can be minimized.",

            "model_answer": "To break the security of the Diffie-Hellman method, an attacker (a man-in-the-middle) can insert themselves between two parties and intercept their communication.

Impersonate one of the parties in the communication.\n4. Decrypt any messages that were sent between the two parties.\n\nIf an attacker is successful in this, they can intercept and read any messages that are sent between the two parties, and even send messages as if they were one of the parties. This is because the attacker can present the public key from their own key pair to the other party, and the other party will use that public key to encrypt messages to the attacker.
