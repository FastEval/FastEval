These temporary dipoles occur due to the movement of electrons around the nuclei which creates a slight imbalance in the electron distribution.\n3.

            "model_answer": "The atomic radius is given and it is 77 pm (picometers). Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom and it also gives us information about the size of the atom. It is given as 1086 kJ/mol. \n\nTo find the first ionization energy, we need to remove one electron from carbon atom. Carbon has 6 electrons, so we need to remove one of them. We will use the formula:\n\nIonization energy = -13.6 eV * (Z^2 / n^2)\n\nWhere Z is the atomic number (number of protons) and n is the principal quantum number of the electron being removed. For carbon, Z = 6 and n = 2.\n\nIonization energy = -13.6 eV * (6^2 / 2^2) = -13.6 eV * (36 / 4) = -176 eV\n\nTo convert the ionization energy into kJ/mol, we need to multiply by Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23):\n\nIonization energy = -176 eV * (6.022 x 10^23) = -1.086 x 10^2 kJ/mol\n\nSince we are looking for the first ionization energy, we need to consider only the outermost electron. Therefore, (A) 70 pm, 1402 kJ/mol is incorrect as it does not match with the given information. \n\nThe atomic radius of carbon is already given as 77 pm which is option (B): \n\n(B) 86 pm, 898 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the answer is (B) 86 pm, 898 kJ/mol.",

Step 3: To do this, we need to convert the given mass of nitrogen into its moles. Step 4: The molecular weight of nitrogen (N2) is 28.02 g/mol. To find the moles, we can use the formula: moles = mass / molecular weight. Step 5: Moles of nitrogen = 28.0 g / 28.02 g/mol = 0.995 moles. Step 6: Now, we can use the formulafor partial pressure: partial pressure = moles x molecular weight x total pressure / total volume. Since we are only interested in the partial pressure of nitrogen, we can ignore the volume of the other two gases. Step 7: Partial pressure of nitrogen = 0.995 moles x 28.02 g/mol x 2.0 atm / 1 L = 1.755 atm. Step 8: We are looking for the absolute value of the partial pressure: |1.755 atm| = 1.755 atm.

Thus, option (C) isoelectronic with a noble gas is also wrong.\n\nSolubility is the ability of a substance to dissolve in water.

In sulfurous acid, the O-H bond is polar with partial double bond character, which makes it stronger than the O-H bond in sulfuric acid. This is because the oxygen atom in sulfuric acid is more electronegative than the oxygen atom in sulfurous acid, which makes the O-H bond in sulfuric acid weaker than in sulfurous acid. Additionally, the electronegativity of the sulfur atom in sulfurous acid also contributes to the strength of the O-H bond.
