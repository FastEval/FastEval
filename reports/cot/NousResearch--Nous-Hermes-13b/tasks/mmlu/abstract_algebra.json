This permutation may be represented as a pair of tuples, where the first tuple represents the numbers being permuted in the first position, and the second tuple represents the numbers being permuted in the second position. \n\nNow, we need to find the index of p in S_5. The index of an element in a group is the number of distinct left cosets that it generates. In this case, we need to find the number of distinct ways that the permutation given can be obtained by acting on the identity permutation in S_5.\n\nThe identity permutation in S_5 is the tuple (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). To obtain p from the identity permutation, we need to perform the permutation represented by the first tuple of p on the first position and the permutation represented by the second tuple of p on the second position. This means that we need to map each of the elements of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} to itself or to one of its neighbors (adjacent in the cycle) in some order.\n\nThere are no restrictions on the order in which these mappings are applied. Therefore, for each element in the set, there are 5! = 120 possible permutations of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, which include the identity permutation itself.\n\nSince there are no restrictions on the order in which the permutation is obtained, there is only 1 distinct left coset generated by p in S_5, and the index of p in S_5 is therefore 120/(5!)=8.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n(A) 8",

Therefore, the group must have at least 15 different elements (including the identity element) that can be generated by raising the generator to powers from 1 to 15. Since there are 15 different powers of 15, a group with an element of order 15 must have at least 15 elements of order 15. However, we are only interested in the number of elements of order 15, so we divide 15 by the order of the element (15) which gives us 8, so the group must have at least 8 elements of order 15. Thus, statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nProof: We already established in statement 1 that if a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15. However, we are now given that the group has more than 8 elements of order 15. Since there are already 8 elements of order 15, having more than 8 elements of order 15 means that there must be additional elements of order 15 that are not counted in the 8 elements we already found. These additional elements are the ones that make the group have more than 8 elements of order 15. Since these additional elements also have order 15, they must also be counted among the 16 elements of order 15. Thus, statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) True, True",

A factor group is a group formed by \"factoring out\" a normal subgroup from another group. So, this statement suggests that any homomorphic image of G can be obtained by factoring out a normal subgroup from G.\n\nStatement 2: The homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G.\n\nThis statement reflects the content of the first one, saying that the set of all homomorphic images of G (up to isomorphism) is equivalent to the set of all factor groups of G (up to isomorphism).
