Compare the given sum with the total sum of each arithmetic sequence.\n\nStep 1:\nThe given sum is 240, and a geometric sequence has a common difference of 1. To find a sum that is smaller than 240, we need to increase the common difference. A arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2 would have a sum of 2(119) = 238, but since it has to be an odd number we subtract 1.
