            "correct_answer": "(K)",
            "model_answer": "1. The first thing to notice is that there is a \"M\" command in the SVG path element, which stands for \"move.\"\n2. After the \"M\" command comes a list of coordinates, in this case \"(73.00,72.00)\" and \"(9.00,72.00)\".\n3. The \"L\" command comes next, which stands for \"line.\" \n4. After the \"L\" comes another list of coordinates, in this case \"(9.00,37.00)\" and \"(73.00,37.00)\".\n5. The final \"L\" command comes next, along with its list of coordinates, which are the same as the second set of coordinates, \"(9.00,37.00)\" and \"(73.00,37.00)\".\n6. The \"z\" command comes last, which stands for \"close\" and indicates that the path is complete.\nBased on this information, we can determine that the SVG path element is drawing a polygon. Specifically, it is drawing a quadrilateral with two adjacent pairs of congruent sides. The coordinates suggest that it is indeed a quadrilateral, with one pair of sides being diagonal. \nTherefore, the answer is (F) octagon.",
