Therefore, this is the correct option. \n\nOption C: raidems of the lost ark: This is a typo, and does not create a humorous effect. \n\nOption D: raiuders of the lost ark: This changes 'lost' to 'raiuders', which is a nonsensical substitution and creates a humorous effect.

In addition, the word \"shop\" is changed to \"hop,\" which also adds humor to the edit. The word \"horrors\" remains unchanged, which is also a humorous detail. \n\nTherefore, the answer is option B: \"little hop of horrors.\"",
