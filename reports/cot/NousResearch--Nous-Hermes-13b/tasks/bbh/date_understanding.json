This can be done simply by adding the number of days that have passed since Mar 20, 2020, which is 176, to tomorrow's date. \n\nWith that in mind, let's calculate the date tomorrow. The date today is September 13, 2020, so the date tomorrow will be September 14, 2020. Adding 176 days to September 14, 2020 gives us May 17, 2021. \n\nSo, the date tomorrow, in MM/DD/YYYY format, is 05/17/2021.",

To do this, we need to first determine how many days there are between Sep 9, 1909 and today's date. \nNext, we need to subtract 10 days from that total. Finally, we need to convert the resulting date back into its mm/dd/yyyy format. \nLet's start by finding the number of days between Sep 9, 1909 and today: \n- There are 116 years and 3 days (116 years x 365 days/year = 40,485 days) \n- Since Sep 9, 1909 fell on a Monday, today, Sep 9, 2020 is also a Monday. \n- Therefore, there are 3 days between the two dates (1 day for illicit relationships, 1 day for punctuation, 1 day for spelling). \nNow that we know there are 3 days between the two dates, we can subtract 10 days from that total to get the date 10 days ago from Sep 9, 1909: \n- 3 days - 10 days = -7 days \n7 days is a negative number, which means we need to add 7 days to today's date to get the date 10 days ago from Sep 9, 1909. \nTherefore, the answer is (A) 08/29/1909. \nFinal answer: (A) 08/29/1909.",
