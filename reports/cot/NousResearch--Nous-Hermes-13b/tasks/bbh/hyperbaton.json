The final answer is letter 'A'.",

In English, the general rule for adjective order is 1) opinions, 2) size, 3) age, 4) shape, 5) material, 6) color, 7) origin, 8) user, 9) noun.\nWithout knowing the complete sentence, it is difficult to determine the correct adjective order. However, the sentence must contain two adjectives that have the same characteristic (e.g., size or shape) and two adjectives that have the same characteristic (e.g., age or material), etc.\nIn this case, the only given options are two adjectives that have the same characteristic (enormous and German), so none of them have the correct adjective order.",

            "model_answer": "Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n1. Identify the adjective in each sentence:\nA: square\nB: old-fashioned\n2. Determine the correct adjective order:\nAccording to linguistic guidelines, adjectives should ideally be ordered in terms of their intensity (i.e. how specific or descriptive they are). \n- This typically means that more specific/descriptive adjectives should come before less specific/descriptive ones in a list or phrase. \n- In this case, we have three adjectives: \n    - \"Congolese\" is a nationality or ethnicity\n    - \"driving\" is related to behavior or actions\n    - \"old-fashioned\" is an opinion or judgment on the car's style.\n- Therefore, based on the intensity of each adjective, the correct order would be: [Congolese, driving, old-fashioned].\n3. Determine the correct sentence:\nA: square Congolese driving old-fashioned dog\nB: old-fashioned square Congolese driving dog\n- According to my analysis, sentence A has the correct adjective order.\n- This is because \"Congolese\" is more specific than \"Square\", \"driving\" is more specific than \"old-fashioned\", and \"old-fashioned\" is more specific than \"dog\".\n- therefore, sentence A is the correct sentence.\n4. Output the answer:\nThe sentence with the correct adjective order is (A) square Congolese driving old-fashioned dog.",
