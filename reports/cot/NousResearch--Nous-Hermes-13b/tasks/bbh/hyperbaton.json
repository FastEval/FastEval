            "model_answer": "To determine the correct adjective order, we need to consider the basic rule that adjectives follow in English, which is to order them in this hierarchy: opinion-size-age-shape-color-origin. \nBased on this, we can start by determining which adjectives refer to physical attributes of the sweater. Size and color are physical attributes, whereas age refers to the time period in which the sweater was made. Therefore, the correct order for the physical attributes would be: small old grey Brazilian. \nNext, we need to determine whether shape is a physical attribute or an opinion, but since it is not mentioned in any of the options, we disregard it for now. \nFinally, we need to consider the origin of the sweater. Since origin refers to the place where something is made, it falls in between age and color. Therefore, the correct final order would be: small old (smaller grey Brazilian sweater). \nBased on this reasoning, the correct sentence would be option (B): midsize grey Brazilian old sweater.",
