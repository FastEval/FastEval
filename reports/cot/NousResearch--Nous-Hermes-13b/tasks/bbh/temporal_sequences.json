We need to find out when she was available to go to the football field. \nWe cannot assume any time other than the ones mentioned above because we do not have any information about any other events that happened during the day apart from the ones already mentioned. \nOut of the places where we know Lisa was, the only place left where she has not been mentioned going back is the football field.
