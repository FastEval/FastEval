            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) - \"Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight years ago.\" \n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning: \n\n1. We are given two options:\n\n   (A) Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight years ago\n   \n   (B) Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight days ago\n\n2. We can immediately eliminate option (B) because it doesn't make sense in the context of the question. The word \"good\" suggests that there is sarcasm in the statement. \"Eight days ago\" is not significant or relevant to the question. Therefore, option (B) cannot be sarcastic.\n\n3. Now we are left with option (A) \"Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight years ago.\" Let's analyze this statement for sarcasm. \n\n4. The use of the word \"good\" suggests that the speaker does not really mean that it is a good thing. Instead, they might be implying that it is not a good thing, but they are using sarcasm to express their frustration.\n\n5. The phrase \"things aren't more expensive now than they were eight years ago\" suggests that the speaker might be referring to a time in the past when things were less expensive. This could be a comparison to the present, implying that things are more expensive now.\n\n6. Therefore, option (A) \"Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight years ago\" is sarcastic. The final answer is therefore \"A\", with parentheses around the sarcastic statement.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of the statement. Option A says the speaker is glad to feed elephants, an endangered species, while Option B says the speaker is glad to feed trolls, another endangered species. \n\nAssuming the speaker is genuinely glad to feed animals, the sarcastic statement would be the one that uses an ironic tone to convey the opposite meaning. At first glance, Option A might seem sarcastic because the speaker is using a sarcastic tone to say something positive about feeding elephants even though they are an endangered species. However, upon further examination, it is clear that the speaker's tone is genuinely positive.\n\nThe sarcastic statement would then be Option B. The speaker's tone is sarcastic because they are using a lighthearted tone to say something negative about feeding trolls, even though they are an endangered species. So, the answer is (B) You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the trolls, that woefully endangered species.",

            "correct_answer": "(A)",
            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to consider the context in which the statement is made. Sarcasm is a form of irony that is often used to convey the opposite meaning of what is being said. With this in mind, let's analyze each statement:\n\nStatement A: \"Without the river there's no water and no electricity. Blocking it is such a smart move!\" This statement is sarcastic because the speaker is likely expressing frustration or disbelief that someone would intentionally block a river that provides essential resources such as water and electricity. The use of the word \"smart\" here is sarcastic because it suggests the opposite meaning, i.e., that blocking the river is a foolish and unwise decision.\n\nStatement B: \"Without the river there's no water and no electricity. Blocking it is such a terrible move!\" This statement is also sarcastic for the same reason as Statement A. The speaker is likely expressing frustration or disbelief that someone would intentionally block a river that provides essential resources such as water and electricity. The use of the word \"terrible\" here is sarcastic because it suggests the opposite meaning, i.e., that blocking the river is a terrible and horrible decision.\n\nTherefore, both statements are sarcastic. The final answer is: \"Neither - both statements are sarcastic.\" (Output in parenthesis: \"Neither - both statements are sarcastic.\")",

            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and context of the statements. \n\nFirst, let's look at the dollar amount. There's a significant difference between a $50,000 scholarship and a $50 scholarship. Depending on the context, a large amount of money could be perceived as a poor thing. However, without more information on the individual's circumstances, it's difficult to definitively say that this statement is sarcastic. \n\nNow, let's look at the language that follows the dollar amount. \n\nStatement (A) seems to be expressing shock or disbelief at the fact that someone would receive a $50,000 scholarship, even if it took them years to earn it. It's possible that the speaker thinks that this amount is excessively large, and therefore, expressing sarcasm. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if the tone is sarcastic. \n\nOn the other hand, statement (B) seems to be expressing pity or sympathy towards the individual who only received a $50 scholarship after years of work. The use of the word \"poor guy\" and the emphasis on the small amount of money imply that the speaker may feel that the reward is not commensurate with the effort put in. Therefore, it's possible that this statement is sarcastic.\n\nOverall, without more information on the tone and context, it's difficult to definitively say which statement is sarcastic.",
