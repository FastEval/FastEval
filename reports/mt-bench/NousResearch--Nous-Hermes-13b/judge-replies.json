However, we can use numerical methods to approximate the solution.\n\nOne such method is the Newton-Raphson method, which iteratively refines an initial guess for the root. The formula for the Newton-Raphson method is:\n\nx_new = x_old - f(x_old) / f'(x_old)\n\nwhere f'(x) is the derivative of f(x) with respect to x. First, let's find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf(x) = 4x^3 - 9x - 14\nf'(x) = 12x^2 - 9\n\nNow, let's apply the Newton-Raphson method with an initial guess of x = 1:\n\n1. x_new = 1 - (4(1)^3 - 9(1) - 14) / (12(1)^2 - 9)\n   x_new = 1 - (-9) / 3\n   x_new = 1 + 3\n   x_new = 4\n\n2. x_new = 4 - (4(4)^3 - 9(4) - 14) / (12(4)^2 - 9)\n   x_new = 4 - (256 - 36 - 14) / (192 - 9)\n   x_new = 4 - (206) / (183)\n   x_new \u2248 2.876\n\n3. x_new \u2248 2.876 - (4(2.876)^3 - 9(2.876) - 14) / (12(2.876)^2 - 9)\n   x_new \u2248 2.876 - (99.98) / (99.99)\n   x_new \u2248 1.876\n\nWe can continue this process until the change in x_new is very small, indicating that we have found an approximate root. After several iterations, we find that:\n\nx \u2248 1.876\n\nSo, the approximate value of x such that f(x) = 0 is x \u2248 1.876. Note that this is an approximation, and there may be other roots as well.\n\nRating: [[8]]"

The function uses a vector to store the sequence, starting with the first three numbers: 0, -1, and -1. It then uses a loop to calculate the remaining numbers in the sequence by adding the three preceding ones. Finally, the `main` function prompts the user to enter the value of `n`, calls the `find_nth_number` function with this value, and prints the result to the console.\n\nTo compile and run the program, save it to a file named `sequence.cpp` and then use the following commands:\n\n```sh\ng++ -o sequence sequence.cpp\n./sequence\n```\n\nEnter the value of `n` when prompted, and the program will output the nth number in the sequence.\n\nRating: [[7]]"
