That's not my job,\" Rodman told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"New Day\" Friday. \n\nIt was his first interview since entering an alcohol rehabilitation facility two weeks ago. \n\nThe former basketball player is probably the American with the most access to the North Korean leader, and many have been critical that he has not lobbied for the release of American prisoner Kenneth Bae from a labor camp. \n\n\"I'm not an ambassador, and I tried to strive and tell people, just because I know the marshal (Kim), that doesn't mean I know the marshal like that,\" he said. \n\nRodman says he didn't mean to insinuate during an earlier interview this month that he knew why Bae, a Korean-American, was being held in North Korea. \n\n\"To this day I still don't know what he did,\" Rodman said, even offering to take Bae's place if he could. \n\n\"I feel for (Bae's family).
