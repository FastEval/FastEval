In other words, you can say \"a given situation contradicts common sense.\" For example, if someone promises to bring you some fruits but does not do it, you can say: \"The spring is with flowers, and the quails don't come from harvest\" - meaning the person's promise contradicts common sense because they didn't fulfill their commitment.\nAnother interpretation of the phrase could be related to politics. When politicians make unrealistic promises during an election campaign, people often respond ironically by saying: \"The spring is with flowers, and the quails are coming from harvests\" - meaning politicians' statements contradict common sense and expectations about what changes need to happen for society to improve.\nFinally, you might hear someone say this sentence when there is simply no explanation for why something has happened. In situations where cause-and-effect relationships seem inexplicable, Bulgarians sometimes refer back to the proverb: \"The spring is with flowers, and the quails aren't coming from harvest.\" The phrase implies that we should remain patient and wait for answers, even though they may never appear.\nThis proverb is often used humorously and ironically by younger generations who want to mock traditional values. Older people tend to take these kinds of comments more seriously than younger ones, which leads to interesting discussions between different age groups. If you are speaking with Bulgarians about this proverb, remember that older individuals might find your irony offensive. Instead, try using it playfully among peers who share similar", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You will be prompted with a single word. Does this word exist in the Bulgarian language?
