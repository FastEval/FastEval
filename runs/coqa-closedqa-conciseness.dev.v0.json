Based on the passage, the user's question, and the given answer options, the assistant correctly chose option A: \"Probably he [Bangs] and Bimbel have quarreled.\" This is because the text states that those kinds of events might have happened years ago due to the lack of population and increased number of bad men.

That's not my job,\" Rodman told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"New Day\" Friday. \n\nIt was his first interview since entering an alcohol rehabilitation facility two weeks ago. \n\nThe former basketball player is probably the American with the most access to the North Korean leader, and many have been critical that he has not lobbied for the release of American prisoner Kenneth Bae from a labor camp. \n\n\"I'm not an ambassador, and I tried to strive and tell people, just because I know the marshal (Kim), that doesn't mean I know the marshal like that,\" he said. \n\nRodman says he didn't mean to insinuate during an earlier interview this month that he knew why Bae, a Korean-American, was being held in North Korea. \n\n\"To this day I still don't know what he did,\" Rodman said, even offering to take Bae's place if he could. \n\n\"I feel for (Bae's family). I feel for them deeply. ... I would do anything literally. This is Dennis Rodman talking. If they (North Korea) said, 'We'll take Dennis Rodman and we'll let Kenenth Bae go,' I'll say, 'You know what? I'll do that. ...

To this day I still don't know what he did, Rodman said.\n\nI feel for [Bae's] family. I feel for them deeply. ... I would do anything literally. This is Dennis Rodman talking. If they [North Korea] said, 'We'll take Dennis Rodman and we'll let Kenneth Bae go,' I'll say, 'You know what? I'll do that. ... Take me.'.\n\nQ: Did Rodman ask for Bae's release?\nA: No, he never asked for the release of Kenneth Bae. He only offered himself to be taken instead of Bae if given the chance by North Korea authorities. Even though he is friendly with Jong Un, he lacks knowledge regarding North Korea political affairs which makes him unable to negotiate for prisoners. In addition, he also states he is not an Ambassador or responsible for knowing such matters. However, he feels sorry for Bae and his family. As previously mentioned, he also entered rehab due to drinking issues. These are some quotes from the article that can support your answers:\n\n1. Many have been critical that he has not lobbied for the release of American prisoner Kenneth Bae from a labor camp.\n2.

With a cigar in his mouth, and his hands behind his back, he was strolling about his handsomely furnished sitting-room at Claridge's, dictating to a secretary, while from an adjoining room came the faint click of a typewriter. Virginia entered somewhat unceremoniously, followed by Guy. Phineas Duge looked at them both in some surprise. \n\n\"Uncle,\" she said, \"I met Guy coming away from Coniston Mansions.
